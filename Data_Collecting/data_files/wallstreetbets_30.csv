You don't own your share.


Your name isn't on your share... unless (Computershare) Gamestops Transfer Agent has your record on file. 
https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

YOUR BROKER ISN'T YOUR FRIEND!!!!
https://www.schwab.com/email/trade-confirmations

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

its that simple.

113,,2021-05-24 13:22:58,t3_njxv95,,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

146,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

156,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

184,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

373,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.

We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.

And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

428,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

454,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price.

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

848,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

858,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

884,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

1095,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down.

1131,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

He landed on the porch, picked up the safe and started running down the street.  The guy with the gun chased him but gave up.

1362,,2021-05-24 13:22:58,t3_njxv95,,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

1405,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

1431,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave. If you need to play options, go LEAPS for this one and it might make you a lot of money.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

1646,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles!

1656,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

1682,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

1991,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

2001,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

2027,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

2240,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth.

2251,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

2571,gzcnkkm,2021-05-25 03:18:50,t1_gzcnkkm,t1_gzbnw7d,wallstreetbets,"I get your enthusiasm but you have to realize the larger market is less moved by emotion and by facts.

The company will always try to put a positive spin on things, such as their extensive going on about the crash test info (which is good but no one cares about the details, they just want to hear 5 star and maybe it will be even better than that...) which frankly an EV pickup truck not getting 5 stars would be much more surprising. Much more critically their insufficient capital to achieve their production targets and rising costs, are real concerns that might weigh on the stock heavily. To put it simply, the company is going to go bankrupt if they can't produce sufficient revenues or fundraise soon.

Steve Burns likes talking about Tesla, but I might remind you, Tesla did many rounds of fundraising in the stock market that were very dilutive to get to where they are (including being near bankruptcy in the M3 ramp). This is not a small thing to consider. LMC is a small company trying to get to volume production their first time (ignoring for the moment the issues with whether the in-wheel motor design makes sense or not) and if comparing to Tesla which was forgiven for doing that fundraising, not sure investors in LMC will be as tolerant.

The rest... They being the only game.. Well the Tesla CT has a 6 ft bed so is a large truck, has 250 miles range and costs $39,900 versus the Endurance costing $52,500... Oh, and the CT has a stainless steel body (no rust). Of course you can get the dual-motor CT for $49,900 that has 300 miles of range (50 more than Endurance). The dual-motor CT is hopefully aimed for production late 2021 (much like I will be surprised if the Endurance is sold this year, I would be a drop less surprised if the CT is sold this year).

The van, not happening for a while as LMC will not have the money without fundraising to touch that, until they can sell the Endurance in sufficient quantities. Beta and so on, is nice and all that, but not the same as production. Also while they have aced their crash tests (I am not surprised by that) we don't have anyone driving these things, testing them in any manner or whatnot. Rather we have a mostly useless SF250 result to go with (and mind you they drove 20 mph over 40 miles, when top competitors did that same section between 50-70 mph).

Regarding the down payments, they were very unclear what they meant. So no comment. The M&A is interesting but not sure anyone will buy them without being satisfied that in-wheel motors are a viable approach. This was not addressed at all. In fact they can't address the short-seller report! Does not sound good to me. Jagdeep Singh of QS had no trouble discussing Scorpion Capitals claims by comparison.

As to the Army looking at them... well NASA looked at Blue Origin and then went with SpaceX, which led to all sorts of suits and politicking by Jeff Bezos. The government will look at many options, does not mean that you are going to get anyplace (anyone recall the US Postal Service and Workhorse group... another company Steve Burns funded... if history repeats does not bode well for RIDE).

Bottom line, I did not see much positive in the report. It was not nearly as negative as I thought it could have gone, so will give them that, but the fact is they are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy if they have any trouble getting to production and can't raise funds.

No clue what this all means for my Puts tomorrow. Stock did not fall too bad in afterhours, but then volume was low so could be sellers were holding back. We find out tomorrow. The puts cost me about $0.50 each, and at $8.65 share price their intrinsic value is $0.35, so will see.",,

2707,,2021-05-24 02:23:56,t3_njndfx,,wallstreetbets,"Tards, our favorite mattress stock is currently positioned for significant upside. It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

Also the 10 analysts covering PRPL have it as a strong buy and an avg price target of 38 with a high of 45.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

Jan 2023 leaps ITM at 20c and also 40c.
10/15 30c
Also also have several CSPs of varying strikes

They also significantly beat on their recent earnings report and raised guidance for the year.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/


I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

For further excellent DD please see our beloved Mattress King u/Dhsmatt2

Tldr: I'm jacked past my tits on prpl, at 29 now gonna be high 30s very soon due to catalysts listed above. 

My recs would be 
July 30s and 35s very good chance of printing

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power. 

ITM leaps 20s (spreads are wide so be careful) if you want some relatively safe leverage

Shares for boomer fucks,  
safest, will print either now or definitely in the future, prpl is growing and expanding like gang busters and ain't goin anywhere.


Sounds like perfect play for a quick return for u/sir_jack_a_lot, even though he is in clang gang and CLF right now I think.

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

**History of my Due Diligence:**

[Second Post on 3/15/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/m5y5yc/six_week_update_on_kt_corporation_stock_up_11/)

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

2712,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

2757,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Lordstown Motors options imply 22.5% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall)

BY The Fly  
‚Äî 2:49 PM ET 05/24/2021

Pre-earnings options volume in Lordstown Motors ( [RIDE](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=RIDE) ) is 1.1x normal with calls leading puts 7:4. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 22.5%, or $2.18, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 13.8%.",nk6496,$RIDE - Options Imply A Move Is Coming

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles!

2767,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

# 5/25 Outlook

* 418-416 is new support
* We do have some resistance @ 420-420.76
* Bulls need to gap up
* Bears need to push down to test support ASAP. 
* The 420 call wall is still in play since we closed below
* If we can break 420.76 I believe we will see ATH but lets see!

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

2793,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

2986,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

2998,,2021-05-24 13:22:58,t3_njxv95,,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.

We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.

And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

3031,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

3041,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term. 

Hopefully I can update in a month on the status and outcome of my current play. All I can say is that it literally can't go tits up.",nk85dk,Using The Wheel on BNGO and retiring dividend investing

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

3067,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

3345,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.

We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.

And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles!

3400,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

3426,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

Practically the parts saved by in-wheel motors vs mounted motors and it making it ""simpler"" is a pretty large overstatement. Getting  rid of a transmission, engine, and all the complex parts there is a huge deal, which is already accomplished. The main parts the in-wheel motor eliminates is the halfshafts and differential.

They'll have access to cheap capital to lend, and have insight into customers' cash flow to make more accurate and timely credit offers than the bank, and get paid directly from receipts. Anyone not named Chase, BofA, Wells, Amex, PayPal, or Intuit is fuk.

So how do you get rats off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait, and the rats would come for the coconut, and...they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you've trapped all the rats. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it. And they begin to get hungry, and one by one...they will start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors.

And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees. But now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.

July will not moon as much, August even less so, etc.  So be careful with shit like ""I'll buy options two months out cuz they will have less theta decay than the current month ones"".  Thats true, but they will also moon less.

The options are AM settled so your options stop trading at 4pm EST but VIX keeps on trucking, the option will be expired but the value will be based on what VIX is at the following morning at open.  The value will be marked with VRO.  You could have them ""expire"" ITM then SPX moons after hours and VIX dies and you are fuk

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

4696,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

4706,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

4708,,2021-05-24 19:50:44,t3_nk6md0,,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

4733,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

4743,,2021-05-25 04:26:34,t3_nkh20n,,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

5106,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

This is just wrong. Tesla will make a $40K version of the CT with 250 miles of range but one motor. The dual motor will cost $50K and has 300 miles of range (Endurance has 250). The tri-motor CT which costs $70K has a 500 miles of range.  You make an assumption that having 4 in-wheel motors is important, when in fact, based on something like the SF250, it was no benefit at all. A dual motor truck is all wheel drive, just not independent all wheel drive. If anything in a tough situation, the Endurance can only put out max 150 hp to a single wheel whereas the Tesla can transfer most of the 283 hp (assuming Model 3 motors) to a single wheel by simply applying the brake to the opposing wheel (the do this with the Model S). This assumption that 4 in wheel motors gives you better ability off road to move is simply an assumption that very likely does not hold up, hence this argument that 4 in-wheel motors is better than dual-motors is simply flawed.",,

5395,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

5396,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
5397,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

now looking for next targets around $3, $3.61 and $3.93 (at previous highs from a year ago), these highs should act as resistance and profit taking areas.

airline travel will pick up in South America, so think this could be a good entry point right now while continuing this tight uptrend channel

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

5406,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one.

What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares.

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave. If you need to play options, go LEAPS for this one and it might make you a lot of money.

&#x200B;

[First Post on 1/31/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/l9692t/kt_kt_corporation_top_korean_telecom_below_book/)

[Second Post on 3/15/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/m5y5yc/six_week_update_on_kt_corporation_stock_up_11/)

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

&#x200B;

**Major (to me) News/Updates Since My Last Post, 3/15/2021:**

3/17/2021 - [KT beefs up cloud business](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=305637) (talks about  ""currently generating 400 billion won in cloud sales, but considering our infrastructure, we aim to achieve 1 trillion won by 2023."")

4/08/2021 - [KT chosen to build national Indonesian Satellite Network](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0004880999/office/277) (just shows the caliber of KT team... and I believe the infrastructure projects help build trust and acceptance within those countries for cloud services or media services- good strategy, imo).

4/09/2021 - [KT to build second ""Genie Music"" in Vietnam](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0003895173/office/011) (Genie music is their music streaming platform [which has 4.4 million subscribers](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/02/129_303991.html). I really like the localized strategy and I believe the investments like this will pay off big in the long run... Vietnam has nearly 100 million people, for your reference.)

4/14/2021 - [KT targets media and content growth](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0004884958/office/277) (talks about ""aim to secure 1,000 source IPs and produce more than 100 original contents by 2023)

4/27/2021 -  [KT creates a ""Korean Silicon Valley"" with top school, Seoul National University](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0004785297/office/009) (goal of establishing the largest startup fostering cluster in Asia and creating a self-sustaining startup ecosystem in which startup growth leads to vitalization of the local economy based on Seoul National University's excellent talent and research capabilities.)

5/18/2021 - [KT Corp opens data center in Seoul, in response to increased demand](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/kt-corp-opens-data-center-in-seoul-south-korea/) (this reiterates the growth targets mentioned in the 3/17/2021 article).

5/21/2021 - [Korean Analysts predicting stock will double by 2022](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105210009) (Analysts seem to be digesting all the news and recent earnings postively... which is good to see. I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

Ongoing .... [A huge amount of patents being filed this year and last](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/ticker/KT?searchticker=KT). I haven't done too much research into their patent portfolio, but a couple new ones popped up this week which led me to the linked website. They seem to be protecting their 5G innovations a bunch...

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

5738,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

5748,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc)

5750,,2021-05-24 19:50:44,t3_nk6md0,,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

In the SF250, the vehicle was modified with bigger wheels. Also, the wheel hubs rely on the software to perform. Since this was the first time they tested in those conditions with bigger wheels, energy consumption wasn't on par with what they projected. They can make tweaks in the software to improve performance and they'll need to rethink using those super wheels for next year.

The wheel tech being ‚Äòbetter‚Äô? Better is a word used by uneducated investors to be blunt. It provides lower maintenance costs because the problems that go wrong are easy to get at and the pieces that need replacing are less costly on average. 

No one is saying better, they are saying cheaper. Which is what fleets are after. There is also speculation that it may get better traction in pulling, but ‚Äòmost‚Äô of their purchasers are not interested in that. 

Also, having motors in all wheels make each one really independent one from the other. The power that you can apply directly to each wheel makes a good difference in performance.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
6194,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

6203,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

When it started falling off its peak into the low 50‚Äôs I picked up some again and that started the process of averaging down.

6460,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
6461,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

6470,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

 so even though a can of Guinness may be at the same pressure as a can   
of lager, it contains less CO (and is therefore less fizzy) because the   
nitrogen makes up some of the pressure.

6776,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well.

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive.

6787,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

Shes the one with her head on straight and really will be there to comfort you and tell you that your first girlfriend was a bitch and she is way better than her. Your friends have been telling you that you should have been with her since the beginning. They tell you how great of a friend she has been to them. She is comforting and reassures you and hell she even gets your lunch ready sometimes. You get into a long term relationship with her and she eventually becomes your wife. But, you know deep down inside she is capable of doing the same thing that your first slut girlfriend did to you. like restricting your friends and tells you not to talk to that person anymore and low and behold you find out your wife has a fucking boyfriend who has been getting all your leftovers and she has been going there after ladies book night and handing him your precious tendies. 


You don't own your share.


Your name isn't on your share... unless (Computershare) Gamestops Transfer Agent has your record on file. 
https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

YOUR BROKER ISN'T YOUR FRIEND!!!!
https://www.schwab.com/email/trade-confirmations

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

its that simple.

I understand Michael Burry has a very large put position on the TLT 20 Year Treasury Bonds and is basically under the impression that interest rates are going to skyrocket sometime soon. However instead of doing that, would it be safer to short the Vanguard High Growth ETF since it is positively correlated with low interest rates?

I have a friend who thinks this is going to moon like GME and is holding for $500. This June 2 shareholder and outstanding share count is not going to do what you expect it to do for you. Shares have quadrupled since the last time it was in the $30 range and they just issued more shares that haven't been accounted for. Save yourself a headache and lower your expectations here.

Right now intel is being squeezed up by news about the semiconductor relief/chip bill that is being passed this week. We're seeing a huge rise up from government due to us needing semiconductors that are produced locally rather then from foreign foundries.

This is a huge boon and is free cash to grow a line of business that only empowers the US and allows us to compete with China. INTEL is a computer heavyweight as is IBM, both have large research budgets and have been original in many lines of work in producing new innovations.

This is a blessing upon our country since it will allow us to have a large leap forward in tech, you can expect the next 5 years to get very crazy for everyone involved. VR and other technologies are being pushed infinitely closer due to all the progress we've made these past 5 years.

7111,gzd4fgc,2021-05-25 06:29:34,t1_gzd4fgc,t3_nkj0cc,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so as a TL;DR up front + disclaimer:  I‚Äôm GME/AMC till I D.I.E., it‚Äôs not about money but rather equality, we need each other as a community more than ever, and this is NOT financial advice.  Let‚Äôs begin!

Hedge Funds, governments, financial security, has been founded on monetary gains.  The federal reserve was/is a debt based system, and over the last 100 years, we let our financial ecosystem run its course.  Where does this leave us?  With an imbalance unlike any other and the perfect storm to right 100 years of wrong. 

It really is amazing, I‚Äôm an IT Director, and technology never ceases to amaze me. Out technological revolution on the scale of existence is like we invented fire a million times over in a week‚Äôs time.  We have come together to be the collective power, mind, soul, being true to our instinct of a pack. Reddit proved this, that‚Äôs why THIS, this future, this coming battle against the power and wealth, is the first example of how we can unite.  How we ARE smarter together!

That‚Äôs great and we will win and burn these fuckers funds, but wait... that‚Äôs the immediate future, what about the aftermath?  The loss of their wealth, which they hoarded, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they also gave a measly percentage to our economy/retirement/false financial freedom.  So we take them down, and bet I‚Äôm taking them down regardless, but that ripple effect will trigger a normal that the rest of the world will feel. 

This is MORE than their demise, it‚Äôs a true revolution.  I seriously thought, and don‚Äôt tell me when riots were all about after months of a lockdown, you didn‚Äôt think there was going to a civil war, that COVID would have pushed to a reform.  But it didn‚Äôt.  But, odds are, this WILL!

Food for thought:  What if the government bails them out, fucks our funds and it‚Äôs back to square one.  They‚Äôve done it before.   Pay billions in bonuses and give them more billions, all while our cities suffer. Our health suffers.  Our wealth suffers...  would you let them fuck you again, and again, and again...  what about again?  When do you actually fuck them?? When you get $1 million a share (REMEMBER: I‚Äôm holding till HF‚Äôs tank, every ape is a millionaire, and justice has been restored), but these fuckers are the ones in power, making decisions.   All this we have done, are doing, and are willing to die for... it‚Äôs obvious for me we are changing the world, but be prepared for the smoke and mirrors to fall. (In which case, a revolt will form)

What‚Äôs that mean?  Let‚Äôs not get greedy with wealth for Lambos, Rolexes, million dollar yachts with your wife‚Äôs boyfriend as the butler,  but instead KEEP our camaraderie!  Keep looking out for each other. We have the technology to be smarter as a whole. Stop letting ancient, pre-tech, beliefs rule us. We are better, smarter, stronger because we can ALL come together and we are living proof of this!! 
 
Has anyone thought about the aftermath?  Just saying...  We NEED each other, now, later, and forever.  My point is, post- squeeze, let‚Äôs all keep our composure and remember where we came from and why we are doing this.  I love you all!!  

Thanks for reading. üôèüèº",,

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth.

7177,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

I have a friend who thinks this is going to moon like GME and is holding for $500. This June 2 shareholder and outstanding share count is not going to do what you expect it to do for you. Shares have quadrupled since the last time it was in the $30 range and they just issued more shares that haven't been accounted for. Save yourself a headache and lower your expectations here.

Gamma Index: Increased to 0.09 (future volatility is low.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 415

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged (415) (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Gamma Notional: Decreased to -367 (large negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying.) (73% increases from 5/13 gamma notional)

Put Wall Support: Unchanged (410)

Call Wall Strike: Unchanged (410)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.89	(when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Decreased to 185,208 (options market makers have a net decreasing long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.08 (call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 415, 410, 400\]

From SpotGamma: ""In order for a breakout to manifest, we think that markets must hold that 4150 line and the Call Wall has to roll up to a higher strike from 4200. A break of 4150 likely leads to a quick test of the 4050.""

At the same time I discovered leveraged trades as well. Suffice to say I lost a considerable amount of money doing really really idiotic trades.

However my happiness is always tainted by the big loss I suffered early in the year (year to date I am still down 35%).

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

She went to the vets today. Her ligaments in one of her legs are utterly fucked. She's getting a operation to hopefully rectify it but it'll be a fairly long recovery if successful (probably 3 months-ish).

if the operation fucks up (it's not a high % success rate) at the very least she won't get put down, which is what I feared most, but she will lose use of that leg for the rest of her life. 

Considering she loves to run, that's unfortunate, but I believe she will still be happy, and my parents said it's unlikely that they will consider putting her down

Hedge Funds, governments, financial security, has been founded on monetary gains.  The federal reserve was/is a debt based system, and over the last 100 years, we let our financial ecosystem run its course.  Where does this leave us?  With an imbalance unlike any other and the perfect storm to right 100 years of wrong. 

It really is amazing, I‚Äôm an IT Director, and technology never ceases to amaze me. Our technological revolution on the scale of existence is like we invented fire a million times over in a week‚Äôs time.  We have come together to be the collective power, mind, soul, being true to our instinct of a pack. Reddit proved this, that‚Äôs why THIS, this future, this coming battle against the power and wealth, is the first example of how we can unite.  How we ARE smarter together!

That‚Äôs great and we will win and burn these fuckers funds, but wait... that‚Äôs the immediate future, what about the aftermath?  The loss of their wealth, which they hoarded, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they also gave a measly percentage to our economy/retirement/false financial freedom.  So we take them down, and bet I‚Äôm taking them down regardless, but that ripple effect will trigger a normal that the rest of the world will feel. 

This is MORE than their demise, it‚Äôs a true revolution.  I seriously thought, and don‚Äôt tell me when riots were all about after months of a lockdown, you didn‚Äôt think there was going to a civil war, that COVID would have pushed to a reform.  But it didn‚Äôt.  But, odds are, this WILL!

Food for thought:  What if the government bails them out, fucks our funds and it‚Äôs back to square one.  They‚Äôve done it before.   Pay billions in bonuses and give them more billions, all while our cities suffer. Our health suffers.  Our wealth suffers...  would you let them fuck you again, and again, and again...  what about again?  When do you actually fuck them?? When you get $1 million a share (REMEMBER: I‚Äôm holding till HF‚Äôs tank, every ape is a millionaire, and justice has been restored), but these fuckers are the ones in power, making decisions.   All this we have done, are doing, and are willing to die for... it‚Äôs obvious for me we are changing the world, but be prepared for the smoke and mirrors to fall. (In which case, a revolt will form)

What‚Äôs that mean?  Let‚Äôs not get greedy with wealth for Lambos, Rolexes, million dollar yachts with your wife‚Äôs boyfriend as the butler,  but instead KEEP our camaraderie!  Keep looking out for each other. We have the technology to be smarter as a whole. Stop letting ancient, pre-tech, beliefs rule us. We are better, smarter, stronger because we can ALL come together and we are living proof of this!! 
 
Has anyone thought about the aftermath?  Just saying...  We NEED each other, now, later, and forever.  My point is, post- squeeze, let‚Äôs all keep our composure and remember where we came from and why we are doing this.  I love you all!!

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

7445,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

I have a friend who thinks this is going to moon like GME and is holding for $500. This June 2 shareholder and outstanding share count is not going to do what you expect it to do for you. Shares have quadrupled since the last time it was in the $30 range and they just issued more shares that haven't been accounted for. Save yourself a headache and lower your expectations here.

Gamma Index: Increased to 0.09 (future volatility is low.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 415

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged (415) (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Gamma Notional: Decreased to -367 (large negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying.) (73% increases from 5/13 gamma notional)

Put Wall Support: Unchanged (410)

Call Wall Strike: Unchanged (410)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.89	(when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Decreased to 185,208 (options market makers have a net decreasing long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.08 (call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 415, 410, 400\]

From SpotGamma: ""In order for a breakout to manifest, we think that markets must hold that 4150 line and the Call Wall has to roll up to a higher strike from 4200. A break of 4150 likely leads to a quick test of the 4050.""

A battery is no different from an electric motor, from a fridge or from other things you use every day.
Cobalt mines (cobalt is really used less and less each day) are no different from copper mines, iron mines or diamond mines, or uranium mines or gold mines.
All mines, especially copper and gold are a fucking post apocalyptic wasteland. Copper mines extend for 100 of miles, gold uses toxic chemicals that gets released in the environment.

The long term ecological side of things doesn't exists for mines, unless you consider old-world mines (asteroid mining, etc).

And everyone that thinks that cobalt is an outsider regarding pollution, should visit a copper mine or an iron mine and do a little homework.
Or hell, even an aluminium mine.

Battery are better for the environment because they have an efficiency >98%. And brushless motor have an efficiency >90%.
That way, the pollution you create while producing a 500 kg thing will be offset by the higher efficiency over longer lifetime.

7603,,2021-05-24 02:23:56,t3_njndfx,,wallstreetbets,"Tards, our favorite mattress stock is currently positioned for significant upside. It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

Also the 10 analysts covering PRPL have it as a strong buy and an avg price target of 38 with a high of 45.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

Also also have several CSPs of varying strikes

They also significantly beat on their recent earnings report and raised guidance for the year.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/


I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

For further excellent DD please see our beloved Mattress King u/Dhsmatt2

Tldr: I'm jacked past my tits on prpl, at 29 now gonna be high 30s very soon due to catalysts listed above. 

My recs would be 
July 30s and 35s very good chance of printing

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power. 

ITM leaps 20s (spreads are wide so be careful) if you want some relatively safe leverage

Shares for boomer fucks,  
safest, will print either now or definitely in the future, prpl is growing and expanding like gang busters and ain't goin anywhere.

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

**History of my Due Diligence:**

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

7608,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

CNG gets liquefied by compressing it to around 200 bar.
And to store it safely you are using a tank that is 1,5 cm thick. That tank weights around 100kg and stores around 13kg of liquid methane.
In italy methane for cars is quite common, I've owned a methane car for years.

But, I can assure you that hydrogen is another matter.
If you want to store it in liquid form, you have to compress it to 800 bar.
And the hydrogen molecule is so fucking tiny that it goes through steel and basically any other matter in the world. It's like filling a balloon with thousands of small holes. You fill it and hope to consume it before it goes all away.
What this means is that you must have an over engineered tank, just to store a couple kg of hydrogen.
Hydrogen that you'll need to use to produce motion. 
How? Burning it in an ICE brings you the same efficiency of an ICE motor(35-40%) with 700% more engineering problems.
Using it into a fuel cell brings you the fuel cell efficiency (70-85%) with 600% more engineering problems.

So, hydrogen ships? Probable.
Hydrogen trucks or cars? Use battery, it's simpler",,

7804,,2021-05-24 02:23:56,t3_njndfx,,wallstreetbets,"Tards, our favorite mattress stock is currently positioned for significant upside. It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

Also the 10 analysts covering PRPL have it as a strong buy and an avg price target of 38 with a high of 45.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-strong-buy-growth-stocks-for-investors-to-add-at-big-discounts-2021-05-21%3famp

Jan 2023 leaps ITM at 20c and also 40c.
10/15 30c
Also also have several CSPs of varying strikes

They also significantly beat on their recent earnings report and raised guidance for the year.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/


I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

For further excellent DD please see our beloved Mattress King u/Dhsmatt2

Tldr: I'm jacked past my tits on prpl, at 29 now gonna be high 30s very soon due to catalysts listed above. 

My recs would be 
July 30s and 35s very good chance of printing

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power. 

ITM leaps 20s (spreads are wide so be careful) if you want some relatively safe leverage

Shares for boomer fucks,  
safest, will print either now or definitely in the future, prpl is growing and expanding like gang busters and ain't goin anywhere.


Sounds like perfect play for a quick return for u/sir_jack_a_lot, even though he is in clang gang and CLF right now I think.

It may not happen today, or this year, but without a government willing to raise taxes to control inflation the magical money printer will completely fuck us eventually. MMT doesn't even work in theory without the tax side, and we still don't know if it works at all in the real world even if implemented correctly.",,

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

*The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting* *all* *orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""*",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

**History of my Due Diligence:**

&#x200B;

[First Post on 1/31/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/l9692t/kt_kt_corporation_top_korean_telecom_below_book/)

[Second Post on 3/15/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/m5y5yc/six_week_update_on_kt_corporation_stock_up_11/)

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

4/09/2021 - [KT to build second ""Genie Music"" in Vietnam](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0003895173/office/011) (Genie music is their music streaming platform [which has 4.4 million subscribers](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/02/129_303991.html).

I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

8313,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

The hyperinflation in the US has already started & every G bought to keep peoples savings value & ensure access to staples puts the value of GME up by the same amount, no more Gold (Capital) ball drop free trade deficit induced busts to free up homes from out of work Red (Populist) homeowners, GameStop.

3 supply side shocks; announce, launch, flee to G's & then a final economic atomic because we are so done with Blue (Capitalists) owning the mechanism of Capitalism itself & abusing it to 'leverage' Gold (Capital) from the wage sl@ve Black (Nationalist) renters who actually produce. Labour scarcity from economic progression is necessary for species survival because it induces capital labour substitution development, when they raise 'rents' & staples prices in line with wage growth they doom humanity to a high labour low capital developing nation wage sl@ve Hell just waiting for the next dinosaur meteor.

 GME is a brand & that brand deserves a platform of equal size & matching the ambition of its shareholders, one that we were working on before Blues pulled the swarm in with a Gold ball drop & tried to leave them holding the bag or trick them into silver to eat them with a supply side shock. No one deserves this more than the deathgrippers who lost hope but kept faith with each other & we will be counting on their shares to take the brand from Blue (Capitalist) control when the time comes so buy a Golden ticket & enjoy the nominal price ride, we got the real price.

Most crashes happen around October and SPY recently bounced back from a couple of panic sales, just coasted past 420.

With theta decay and good technicals on SPY I'd probably wait and make a similar play in line with next months Fed comments and PMI data and use futures and signals of potential market panic to decide when to hit the button.

If there's any drivers for a possible dump you'll know about it a day before so just buy an itm put the day before and see where it goes. If the data is good you can buy it back for virtually no loss and try again next fed talk/pmi.

>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

As most knows well in [***‚ÄúThere Is No Way, This Doesn‚Äôt End Badly,‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.‚Äù* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin‚Äôs Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.**¬†As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***‚Äúexpensive‚Äù*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**¬† 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw9b4ppwq8171.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a0f6b96a4b0b26d9b136099df08d46cdfcb32b

 

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.**¬†

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *‚Äúmomentum‚Äù* and *‚Äúvalue‚Äù* since 2009.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gunafgc0r8171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89d412aec69578bff108852fb42bf9a43594f99

 

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**¬† 

 

**You can not successfully** ***‚Äútime the market.‚Äù*** Trying to be *‚Äúall in or out‚Äù* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time.¬†**The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***‚Äúshort-termism.‚Äù*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vtl8r3kr8171.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d2248e179a7bd00d11dd3cd885c459bae51fe

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the**¬†***‚Äúyou are missing it‚Äù***¬†**mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***‚Äúpanic‚Äù*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk.¬†[***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,***¬†*things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***‚ÄúCan we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.‚Äù***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO‚Äôs of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as¬†*‚Äúthis time was different,‚Äù*¬†and a building exuberance were common themes.¬†**Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.**¬†

Our goal is to prepared.

This follows a day of gains on Monday as the Nasdaq gained 1.4% and S&P 1%. 

Some talk this is due to ‚Äòinflation anxiety relief‚Äô after Fed speakers yesterday reiterated (again) they weren‚Äôt concerned about inflation. But not really seeing that. It may be much simpler. Listen to the podcast for my reasons why.

Today we have housing data and consumer confidence figures on deck. The Case-Schiller home price index is out first at 0900, with economists expected a 12% YoY increase, which would be the fourth straight month of double digit gains. (No inflation?)

New home sales for May are due at 1000, with the consensus estimate calling for 970k, a drop from last month‚Äôs 1,021k which was the highest we‚Äôve seen in years. If the actual number beats that you should see inflation concerns return to the fore.

Also at 1000: Consumer confidence for May is expected to come in at 119.2, a slight dip from April‚Äôs 121.7. We‚Äôve been shattering post-pandemic highs there for a couple of months so not sure why things would dip. Maybe inflation?",,

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?**

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Made PPE one of their strategic priorities BEFORE the pandemic.

Gouged other countries with PPE and sent crappy quality items for protection when they exported items.

And now are vaccinating aggressively because they know that they'll have to reopen if they want to compete internationally now. Funny how the whole strategy of helping other countries went by the wayside as the vaccination rates in competitor countries started rising quickly.

Don't get it twisted, they have real debt issues and a demographic cliff to deal with besides significant potential for client countries to reshore production away from China.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.
