10,,2021-05-20 04:53:17,t3_ngr5jq,,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

&#x200B;

Thanks for any advice!

So, in the past year I have been working on this with a 3 step approach:  


**1 - Reviewing the literature**

I've read a lot and reviewed a good part of the literature out there (started from Seyhun, Muzea, Cicero, Alldredge...) and came up with some of the key takeaways to define what I deem to be a ""significant transaction"" (i.e. when to buy in, filtering out the noise). Point is that academic literature is not interested in researching and developing a trading model, but rather to investigate the potential policy implications to spot and limit illicit insider trading transactions. As a side note, I can tell you the SEC is way more ahead in this compared to what EU authorities are doing.  


**2 - Tweaking the definition of ""significant purchase"" and populating the database**

Here's a point I really struggled with: I am not a quant and I have a limited experience in R. Somehow I managed to scrape all the data I needed from [http://openinsider.com/](http://openinsider.com/) and started to populate a database. After a while, I realized that the definition I previously came up with, was not so accurate. I can tell you some few things I now pay attention to in filtering out the noise:  
\- Don't focus on big companies (little price misallocation on average + compensation packages are more significant, meaning they don't buy in that often + I suspect ""insiders purchases"" policies are much stricter, but this is just a gut feeling)   
\- Disregard directors and 10% owners (e.g. funds) transactions: these are usually not significant. You want people that are dealing with the day-to-day business that know pretty well the sector they are operating in  
\- Pay attention to mixed signals, especially if  the owner of the company (CEO and 10% owner within the same person) is stubborn enough to buy in when everyone else is fire selling. Don't rely too much on the shares hold that are reported on EDGAR: it is not always accurate.  
\- Look at price patterns, insiders might eventually know better than anyone else what's the fair price of the company, but the market doesn't always reflect it in the short term. To put it differently, monitor the stock when there's a ""significant transaction"", but do not rush if the price is freefalling.   
Needless to say that these are just a very few details I pay attention to and that the list is not at all exhaustive. 

Anyway, after having scraped the data from openinsider I downloaded stocks' price from googlesheets and I am currently studying the price behaviour before and after what I define a ""significant transaction"". To give you few numbers: roughly 70% of the stocks I picked went up more than 10% in the 6-months period (even in years where S&P was flat) and the average time they took to reach it was roughly 40 days. Wait, not all that glitters is gold.  


**3 - Engineer and backtesting**  
Engineering the strategy is what is giving me headaches -  assuming my preliminary results are reliable. I don't know how many stocks I will be buying the next month, so how do I allocate my capital? When should I sell them? Should I start implementing some technical analysis? Which financial instrument should I use?

Finally, as you might guess I have been dedicating quite a considerable amount of time to it and I still have preliminary results, still something I would not be comfortable to trade on the basis of. Plus, I did not manage to backtest it properly: while I am an intermediate user of R (been using quantstrat and quantmod), I still find it hard to backtest a potential strategy through R.

I just completed a research project where I used macroeconomic features from FRED. The monthly data is kept pretty up to date, though I think real time updates are probably a bit optimistic as economic releases are also sometimes delayed (think CPI, which usually has a 1 month delay). In terms of security data, Compustat has high integrity data that is regularly updated, and for this reason commonly used in my field, though again real time is tricky. As per an earlier comment, a market data provider, which won't be cheap, is likely required.

A question you should ask is do you really need real time updates? How often are you expecting to trade? If you are trading on fundamentals or macro data, those do not change daily so trading on them daily does not make sense. If you are expecting to buy and hold, for potentially more than a month or two, there may be cost effective ways of getting your data.",,

You are right, I don't really need real time data in most cases, but during high volatility and uncertain macro events, I would feel confident with updated system.

First you need to break the problem into two distinct phases. 1. Strategy development & Back Testing 2. Real deployment.

For the first part you can use Fred for Macroeconomic data & Yahoo finance for daily stock data. For fundamental data I would not recommend SEC because it’s a pain to work with and also even though there has been a lot standardization in recent years there is still too many variations in what each company reports and how they breaks downs their business. For fundamental I have been using SIPRO from AAII but also looked at intrinio and they seem to be pretty good too.

One additional thing that you’ll need to keep in mind is to get rid of the survivorship bias. Because if you only have the firms that survived till now then the system that buys shit companies probably will make a killing because they “survived” and you didn’t account for the ones that went kaput. Yahoo data won’t have any delisted companies, I use premium data and you can buy the delisted history from them. Additionally because ticker symbol tend to be reused and the companies change them all the time after mergers and things....you’ll need to create a mapping between the stock price data and fundamental data that is point in time. Using some fuzzy matching on name, industry and ticker I was able to solve the mapping for about 80% of delisted tickers.

On the infrastructure side I use python and for long time was using SQLite, one database file per ticker with tables for daily, 5 minutes and fundamental data. It made any cross-section analysis very hard, because I needed to read everything into python first. Last year I added historical Options data and at that point I moved to a 6 machine Citus Cluster (Postgres variant). The data is now split over 6 physical machines but looks like a single logical DB with ticker being the shard key. It’s an order of magnitude faster to both read and write.

Let me know if you need any further help, it’s a hard project.",,

Compustat/crsp rely on something called PERMNO, which is a company's permanent identification number, which takes care of changing names and tickers. Also the two databases never take out companies that are delisted unless for some reason you want them excluded (i.e. if you're studying bankruptcy the delisting for the wide variety of reasons outside of financial distress may not be useful).

Compustat/crsp also provide a wide range of fundamental data points, that get as detailed as you want (such as very specific line items on an income statement, just remember all companies have different income statements so there will be a lot of NaNs for more specific line items).

it's randomly generated hypothetical price fluctuations, but the point being that it doesn't seem like EMAs would provide any signals of future price fluctuations because if the price changes slope/trend/whatever the EMAs lag to the extent equal to their sensitivities; because price influences EMAs but not the other way around, I don't think they would reveal anything in terms of future price fluctuations. It was an exploratory analysis, and the gist I got from it was EMAs just look nice on a plot but don't serve much of a purpose. Maybe I'm wrong though. If what I'm saying is not clear, observe any of the EMAs and when you see a sudden change in the slope or trend of the actual price notice how EMAs shift direction, but they shift direction AFTER the actual prices already shifts.",,

I don't say this to discourage, only to set a realistic expectation. With enough brain power and determination you can totally do it.

**What did I decide to do?** I've decided to spend the last week focusing on sentiment analysis of press release headlines. I decided to look at headlines and the correlated OHLC data for healthcare sector related stocks; then hooked the data up to a ML algorithm doing text classification.  I also removed any headlines from any 'opinion' or recommendation websites.

**What did I find?** A whole lot of nothing for the short-term, but insights for the long-term. It’s hard to find any useful data in vague press release headlines, the real meat is in financial report or the press release article body. I did learn you might be better off in a lot of cases doing short selling. The fear of losing your hard-earned money is a is a great motivator to sell off people’s positions.

**Where am I going from here?** I'm going to look into classifying earnings reports (not an easy feat) or doing simple intraday EMA cross strategies for a  bot that I'm working on. 

I collected the news headline, time that the headline was posted, headline source and daily open & close price for 700 health care related tickers. The data set is approximately 39,000 entries. I figured it might help someone who is looking at sentiment analysis for any projects they might be working on.

I am looking at correlating an asset that implies liquidity moves against a major index. The question is, if the liquidity asset has a high IV compared to the index, can you simply normalise the high IV with lower IV and then search advance/decline % accounting for the IV? For example, asset A has a 90% IV and asset B has 30 IV. Asset A whips around and asset B does not however Asset A appears to rise or fall x days/periods prior to asset B (potentially predictive). If Asset A jumps by say 9% can you divide by 3 (90%/30%) to get likely move in asset B and test for x days till asset B moves (back testing)? Or is that too simple.

This is a myth created by many blogs/news media. TQQQ is best to buy when there is a dip and hold until top. I do swing trades with TQQQ and SQQQ back and forth.

Like yesterday and today I bought SQQQ expecting some change in \^NDX few days.

In fact, I bought TQQQ on Mar 8th (avg $80) and sold after 12 days appx $108, a nice gain.

Theoretically, TQQQ can provide better returns than QQQ or SPY.

Just look at TQQQ price on Jan 2, 2020 (buy) and TQQQ Dec 31, 2020 (sell), you get 100% appreciation. In between, market corrected 30% during Feb-Mar 2020.

Another case, you may be amazed,  buy TQQQ on Jan 3rd, 2011 Monday and Sell it now. The appreciation simply exceeds Amzn or AAPL or MSFT buy on Jan 3rd, 2011 and sell it now. Check morningstar comparison for it.

Here is the chart I created few weeks back for 10 year comparison, TQQQ gave 6000%.

Go to morning star, compare TQQQ returns vs AMZN, AAPL, MSFT...etc for last 5 years or 10 years holding. Except TSLA, no other company exceeds TQQQ returns. As I said already, people should avoid buying TQQQ when market is extreme peak (which causes recessionary period).

I have 5-7 strategies running simultaneously at a time and most don't have hard stop loss. Generally speaking, when trading systematically one has to aim for higher trade count strategies and smaller size bets on individual trades.

Yes I understood what you meant by large stop losses.  With a large stop loss, one would be betting on price recovering eventually, but your equity curve will go through large drawdown dips along the way.  These contribute to your MAE and will tank your Sharpe ratio. So a Sharpe above 2 does not translate to large stop losses. 

( MAE = maximum adversarial excursion. This refers to your unrealized loss ).

Again, no offense, but sometimes it is good to go back and revisit the things that we think we know. I have to do so almost every day, and I am better for it.

Spent 7 months developing a complete system in C# - Initial code used some Quantconnect but moved away but still use some of the library but not full infrastructure.

Before - spent more than year to learn to write strategies/indicators scripted in TradingView  is/was fun and a long list of other platforms that enable automated trading. So when I was profitable and need something a lot more advanced. 

I suggest using something existing first before dropping down that rabbit hole there are many things you have to sort out infrastructure, data, bla bla etc that you will spend the majority, yes majority of your time dealing with till deployment. 

The why? Not because I have experience in writing code and applying Ai as a dev but because I figured how to trade with what technical crap I know. 

First go and find the simplest system or data you can backtest your ideas on if you have never traded before start there.

I calculate the daily range and check where within that range the price closed as a percentage. i.e. a value of 25% means the close was within the bottom 25% of the day’s range. If this value is below a certain threshold, then look at the next day’s return (Close to Close).

I simulated different threshold values from 5 to 100 to measure the likelihood of the next day being a positive day and found that when the price closes nearer the low, the next day is more likely to be an up day

I then backtested this as a simple system (no fees etc accounted for) on a few different indices, which showed excess returns and improved drawdowns. The only trading rule was, if the price closes within the bottom 20% of the day's range then go long and exit at the next day's close.

the reason is that, for example, two consecutive daily 10% gains in QQQ would mean QQQ would gain 21%, where as TQQQ would gain 30% each day, or 69%, and 3x21% is 63% . obviously 69% is greater than 63%. the same works in the reverse effect where consecutive gains/loss would make TQQQs change smaller.",,

>  obviously the math is correct

And clarified that people interpret the math wrong. 

There's a negative sign in front of the (~strictly positive) volatility decay term. You can clearly see from the equation itself that this implies a downward-opening parabola on a risk-return plot for varying amounts of leverage (neglecting the risk of ruin and some other largely irrelevant details). But that merely implies there is an optimal amount of leverage, not that the optima is at 1x. 

The myth is that the levered fund will necessarily underperform on long time periods. As I stated, I can find any number of pop-finance articles which make that claim. That is, the myth is (implicitly) saying that the optimal amount of leverage is 1x, and shooting past it will necessarily decrease expected returns, as you will traverse down the right side of that parabola.

**But this is not the case.** The optimal leverage is often >1x. E.g. it is 3x for US equities since 1950. 

The truth is that volatility decay is exactly what also enables levered funds to *overperform* on long time periods, as the ""underleveraged"" (i.e. 1x) funds are not able to sufficiently capture the *upward* volatility. 

[Maybe you should read some articles clearly refuting this myth instead of trying to put words in my mouth](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php).",,

Try to visualize as if you're teaching your strategy to a kid who knows nothing about markets and then break it down into intricate steps that dont rely on human intuition but pure cause and effect. Now simultaneously learn to code and how you can translate those basic human instructions into a computer instruction based on snippets of code.

This. OP's doing a credit spread options strategy, it honestly look far from 'extremely successful' under examination in that context.

The posted results are cut exactly between the start and end of the last decreasing volatility trend, and I mean exactly - literally the day after and the day before we had volatility spikes. This is the ideal regime where you make money with this approach.

If he didn't carefully crop the dates to make it look better, the results would likely be more typical where you see a **\~20%** gain per quarter as par for the course.

The problem with these strategies is that while you're making \~20% a quarter, around once a year you'll also completely wipe out your position out. You're basically gambling everything on avoiding price shocks with massive leverage. It's like playing Flappy Bird with perma-death.

Who knows though, it may have far better returns than normal. A strategy like this with a minimum **\~120% yearly return**, even with a yearly total wipe out of your position will still very slightly exceed the S&P 500. You just bet half your account on it at a time.

That's the thing with these approaches though. What's the wipe out rate, and long term return? Overall, given the generous time crop it really looks like OP is just getting the market rate of return with extra steps. You can't know until you test it over years though.",,

- Others are right about being wary of infrequent, but massively offsetting losses. I've experienced this personally and seen it happen to others with credit spread strategies. That being said, I hate the attitude on this sub of telling everyone ""too good to be true"" without a specific flaw to point out so if you think you've got something valuable, keep at it 
- Because of the above, your risk management is hugely important. It's always hugely important but strategies with expected high win rates can lull you into a false sense of success and bait you into being too aggressive 
- Backtesting this strategy accurately will be hard because historical options data is expensive and is understandably not feasible for many retail traders to invest in. There are workarounds but even a ""perfect"" backtest isn't as good as long-term, live trading results
- I don't know what kind of response you've gotten from others to collaborate but be selective when picking a partner. You want robust, user-friendly code, especially if you're not a developer yourself because the financial consequences of unforseen issues that you don't have the ability to fix on your own could be huge. This is especially true because Robinhood has no official API so if you're sticking with them, you have no official support. Be skeptical of anyone who's willing to take just your strategy as payment. There is a reason most freelance developers take payment in cash upfront and not a slice of profits for a ""totally killer app idea, bro""

That actually makes sense.  Futures trading happens in a clearing house separate from stock trading.  Under the hood brokers have to sweep funds from the brokerage account into the clearing house account.  Brokers tend to hide this behind the scenes from their users, but it can get a bit complicated.  Eg, say you have 100k in free margin in your stock account and you only do a small trade on /VIX or /BRR or similar (some sort of high volatility futures trade) and so your broker moves over, say, $500 extra into your commodities account under the hood.  Say something crazy happens and the futures you're holding spikes super crazy.  The clearing house will auto magin call you for not having enough in your account and it's rare (maybe impossible today) but your broker can not transfer funds over fast enough so you can get margin called, despite having 100k of free margin.

Anyways, long tangent aside, because it's two different accounts with two different balances under the hood, features like OCO are possible, but it's very hard on the broker so many opt out of more advanced features like that.  Usually how it works is you'll have OCO but for stock only and futures are not applicable.  That's how, eg, Tastyworks does it.  They have features that do not get disabled, but if you try to do it on futures it fails.",,

741,,2021-05-22 11:18:44,t3_nigfjr,,algotrading,"Hello all,

I am doing some forecasting for my MSc thesis and have managed to get some pretty good 1-day ahead forecasts using an LSTM and some engineered features, with accuracy in the range 70% upward. My worry is that I am actually overfitting and just using the previous days price/return as the forecast. 

Obviously I want to check if this is the case. So I computed the correlation between the predicted returns and the true returns and get a correlation of 94.6%. When I compute the correlation between the predicted return and the 1-day lagged actual returns the correlation is 0.3%, leading me to believe that in fact I am NOT copying the previous days return. Are there any other ways I can check this?

It is also like a development environment where you can code and automate trading. Some of these can be developed to a point where they could be reused and metatrader has a marketplace where people can share their ""bots"" which are called expert advisors. Some are free some are paid for. 

With any bot or code that's not your own I'd say you risk it not working as expected. Also given how changeable markets can be bots performances can be mixed and go from doing well to not doing well. In my opinion (take with a pinch of salt cause I am 100% no expert) bots need to be maintained, updated or scrapped over time.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

The point of the post was focused on exploring the relationship (if any) between actual prices and EMAs, and in order to eliminate hindsight bias (i.e. observing prior outcomes and believing we see patterns in the EMAs that wouldn't otherwise ""be obvious"" if we were to observe them in real-time) I plotted randomly generated prices for a hypothetical stock. My conclusions were that it doesn't really seem like EMAs would reveal any predictive information about future price fluctuations because prices influence EMAs but not the other way around, thus anytime the price dramatically changes course, the EMAs lag behind in proportion to the size of their moving windows or number of samples or the method for calculating alpha or however your EMAs are calculated differently, and even the most sensitive EMAs (i.e. the shorter EMAs or the EMAs with smaller windows or samples or whatever) would still follow the actual price at a delay; even the crossing of EMAs or the whether they are above or below the actual price doesn't really seem to reveal anything in terms of predicting future price fluctuations.

What if the opposite happened? XRP crashes. Now XRP/BTC - BTC/USD is an arbitrage opportunity, but XRP has a far smaller daily volume so BTC will prob go down but nowhere near as much as the other way.

So when your typical investor wants to invest, they invest in several of them -- when they get cold feet, they usually get cold feet about crypto in general rather than a particular coin.

976,gz3xaiv,2021-05-22 23:46:03,t1_gz3xaiv,t1_gz3wg2x,algotrading,Well my point was that btc pairs are already established and eth pairs are not seen nearly as commonly as btc. So if the correlation between btc and eth eventually diverges it will take more time to establish those eth pairs that don’t exist yet to really make the difference between btc and eth known. That’s one of the key things for what’s needed for coins to follow eth instead of btc.,,

As for the OP looking at prices in $, that doesn't matter, you can look at prices in any base currency, Euro, Dollars, Chucky Cheese Tokens.  


The fact is that the ""dollar"" in the crypto world is BTC, that is what all other crypto's are pinned to. That's why if you want to see an individuals price movements, you need to look at the BTC markets, then their individual performances are amplified.  


Until BTC is no longer considered the Dollar (e.g. after the flippening occurs one day), this will be the case somewhat.",,
