For example, consider CoreCivic Inc. (CXW).Take a look at their annual free cash flow at the bottom of this page:https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cxw/financials/cash-flowNow compare that to their annual current liabilities on this page:https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CXW/corecivic/balance-sheetEach year since 2017, free cash flow has been less than current liabilities -- not by much, but still less. In other words, the company isn't generating enough cash to pay off its liabilities in time. But if you go back to the cash flow statement and look at net financing cash flow, you see a significant outflow of cash every year. So the company is not only not borrowing money, it's actually paying off lots of debt and buying back stock. Where is this money coming from? How are they meeting their liabilities?",,

What if a credit related event caused liquidity to dry up. What dividend paying stocks would you buy if there was a 60% haircut on nearly all companies? Leading to dividend yields going up (assuming dividends aren't cut). I would try to avoid companies with debt financed dividend (say Exxon). The risk is that companies can cut their dividend if they have issues with their debt or sales drop off.

Volatility can be your friend if you have cash on the sidelines. 

I'm focusing on companies that have recession proof dividends.

My picks:

Altria, EPD, BTI, EVA, LMNR

Energy, tobacco, farmland

The market events causing the stock to go down that much, would be market events putting the dividends in jeopardy.

I would also be too afraid to miss the rebound in growth stocks., by putting my money in value stocks that likely had a weaker drop and a more moderate rebound. Of course, I keep these stocks in my portfolio, because I believe they won't go down as far before something bad happens.

I have some T, AT&T. It has a near monopoly on several utility services many consumers rely on on an expansive network. They can take a small hit in a major market event, but they will maintain revenue better than others. Right now their dividend is just below 7%. Long-term they're going to have problems, they're at risk to losing parts of their business to technology innovation, but they're going to bring in a great deal of revenue over time as it happens.

Of course, in 2008 T didn't fall near as hard from the peak as the overall S&P 500 did, which is the problem with selling assets and buying T and missing the rebound. The S&P 500 rebound after 2008 was much stronger than what T experienced.

My defensive play would be to hold money in defensive stocks constantly still giving me something before the bad times and after a major crash reinvest it into something that will rebound at a higher rate. To me it is a risk hedge in my portfolio for the bad times.",,

This is a retirement account that has certain tax advantages (Taxes that you will pay the government). It will allow you to invest and grow your money and when you reach the age of around 65 you can start using this money for retirement. 

With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, your money grows tax-free, and you can generally make tax- and penalty-free withdrawals after age 59½. With a Traditional IRA, you contribute pre- or after-tax dollars, your money grows tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as current income after age 59½. 

Some other options are a 401k. A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement account. It allows an employee to dedicate a percentage of their pre-tax salary to a retirement account. 

These funds are invested in a range of things like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash.

I am just an old dude on the internet so go watch YouTube or talk to someone whose an actual professional but I suggest you open a roth ira sooner then later. Your future self will think your a bad ass for setting yourself for a comfortable retirement.",,

And investing in a company like XOM makes it worse due to the decades of misinformation, climate change denial, and politicking that the company is responsible for that has undoubtedly worsened the climate crisis. 

I also agree that the world can be harsh and that entertainment is necessary - but cigarettes are a source of relief for people insomuch as the big tobacco industry has created, developed, and propagated an addictive product and strategically embedded itself in cultures around the world to convince people that they're necessary. I will argue that cigarettes are simply bad, full stop, and the world would be a better place without them. 

So taking a step back from discussing the necessity of these companies and products, my original question is about our investment agency more than the existence of the companies: At what point do we as investors disqualify investment in these companies based on the morality of their business regardless of how stellar their divs might be?

My argument is that we shouldn't invest in tobacco or oil companies as a proxy of collective demand that (a) tobacco companies go bankrupt or shut down such that we move on from a world with addictive, cancer-causing tobacco products and (b) oil companies invest their profits in renewable infrastructure, cleaning up the messes they've made in the environment, and decarbonize/divest from continued oil infrastructure development.

Why would they spend money doing those things if they can conduct their business as usual and make their billions in profits?

198,gz4ues9,2021-05-23 05:46:52,t1_gz4ues9,t1_gz4hy50,investing,"Take a step back and ignore the short-term volatility. Let's look at the very long run. And let's look at a very small example, that we can easily make sense of. 

Lets say I own an ice cream shop. It's in a pretty hot region, near a landmark, and it's in a good spot. The shop nets $100,000 in profit, and business is pretty stable year-to-year. I want to sell my business. What's it worth to you? Well, you're going to do some calculation or another, but the calculation will mostly focus around that $100,000 profit per year, because your goal is to make a profit. The yearly profit will determine your payback period, the net present value of the future cash flows, etc. You come up with a number. If I issue 1,000 shares, each share is worth 0.1% of the valuation you came up with.

Now let's say some big news came out. A local politician just decided the landmark next to my business is very culturally relevant, and the government is going to issue grants to bring school children from around the state to this landmark on field trips every year. The legislature just voted on this 10-year grant and it passed. I'm expecting my customers to grow by 50%, and my profits to double. Guess what? You better revisit your previous calculation, because my business is now a lot more profitable. It's not more valuable BECAUSE of the news, so to speak, but everyone now KNOWS it's more valuable, because they have this added information about the future. Therefore, people are now willing to pay more for my business, because the calculation from the previous paragraph is adjusted.

Maybe then news comes out that global warming is accelerating and the hotter summers are going to increase my sales. Or maybe news comes out that the building next door to me is being torn down and a competitor is opening up a ice cream shop. That's going to hurt my margins, which hurts my expected future profits. As soon as the new information becomes available (ie ""news""), everyone readjusts their expected future profit of my business, which changes how much they're willing to pay for it. 

The same applies to publicly traded companies. With stocks, you are benefiting from the future profits because of dividends. Even without dividends, you also benefit from reinvestment in the business because you own a share of those assets. For example, if my ice cream shop had $100,000 in the cash register, and a $500,000 building, it would be worth more than an equivalent shop with no cash and only a $200,000 building. Therefore, as a business builds up its assets (and its profit-making potential) it becomes more valuable. So even if the shop doesn't pay a dividend, as it continues to grow larger, your share grows in value. 

Lastly, lets address the concept of people being ""bag holders"". Just because someone buys a stock from you that you purchased cheaper, doesn't make them a bag holder. A lot of companies have been around for decades, and continue to grow and profit. Many people have bought and later sold them and made money in the process (and collected dividends). As long as the business continues to profit (and/or grow), it can keep becoming more valuable and keep providing benefit to owners. Unlike a ponzi scheme, stocks don't have a limit on their growth. It's not a zero-sum game. Sure some people ""lose"" by timing things very wrong, but overall, in the long term, the large majority are winners. It's not a 50/50 split, there are significantly more winners.

So, who are the ""bag holders""? Really, the bag holders are the ones who overpay for a stock, expecting future profits, and then those profits don't actually materialize, and the business declines in value because people aren't willing to pay as much if it's not going to earn as much money for them. So how does one prevent from overpaying? Well, one important factor is in making sure to adjust their valuation based on all relevant information. When the news hits that a competitor is moving in next door to the ice cream shop, you should quickly downgrade the amount you'd be willing to pay for the shop, or else you risk paying for large profit margins that everyone else now knows won't exist, due to the competition. That seems natural. It's also called ""reacting to news"".

Of course a lot of day-to-day news is white noise, short-term, CNBC filler material. But, signifant news does significantly impact price, and for good reason.",,
199,gz4ufbm,2021-05-23 05:47:05,t1_gz4ufbm,t1_gz4knxe,investing,"No. I recently had a similar conversation with someone that was basically saying, anyone who owns a total market fund own those stocks too. Just at a .01% ratio instead of a higher percentage. But most people with 401ks or pensions don't think twice about it. So why should it be any different if you own a higher percentage? If investing in a tobacco company is morally wrong to you, then don't invest in a total market fund either. If you can live with it, then why not have dividends too?",,
200,gz4ufwd,2021-05-23 05:47:18,t1_gz4ufwd,t1_gz4k6p6,investing,"Part of a value investing strategy is to be in value before the crash and not take as big of a hit as having been all growth. Take advantage of that stability.

If I can vaguely use NASDAQ as a proxy variable for being more growth focused and DJI being more value focused, which is admittedly imperfect and not without some merit, you can look at how they performed in the '70s.

Going into the recession, the NASDAQ took deeper losses initially that would take them longer to recover from. Once the market bottomed out in late '74, DJI out-competed the NASADAQ for about 1.5 years, then the NASDAQ greatly out-competed DJI well into the '80s.

A play that has investments in DJI before that crash, that would switch to the NASDAQ after the rebound takes shape would out-compete staying the course with one or the other.

If you had cash on the sidelines once the market started rebounding, the DJI would've been best for a short time... then NASDAQ was better for far longer.

Basically a more stable, dividend generating company that can keep more of their sales during downturns won't fall as much initially. It didn't fall 60%

So I wouldn't have become a strictly value investor for a decade. I'd maintain a typical balanced portfolio and learn how to adjust in certain conditions to your advantage.

207,gz4v2jj,2021-05-23 05:56:02,t1_gz4v2jj,t3_nittdv,investing,"Trailing stops are a really bad idea in crypto. The market will almost always shake you out of your position right before it takes off. A better option is to set multiple take profit orders on the way up. eg. at every 20% increase, sell 20% of what you have left. This will halve your profits vs. perfectly timing the peak, but the odds of you doing that are way less than 50% anyway, so it makes sense.

I had a pleasant surprise with take profit orders on the stock market recently. It's a bit different in crypto because the market is open 24/7, but it still shows the nature of a take profit order.

I had a take profit set for $4.20. The market closed at $4.10 and then there was some overnight news. In premarket the next day it shot up to $4.80. When market opened, my shares sold for $4.80 - not the $4.20 I had specified. Because a take profit order means ""sell to the highest bidder after the sell price rises above x"" A stop loss by contrast is ""sell to the highest bidder after the sell price drops below x"" So, when you get shaken out, even if your rolling stop is 10% above previous high, if there's an extreme event (which are not uncommon) your trailing stop loss can shake you out for somewhat less than the 10% below the high, because you may well be taking best offers in a rapidly falling market.",,

You are heavily focused on the day-to-day price fluctuations. So if the value of the company is based on the long-term, why does the short term matter? Well, let's say we found out the next 5 summers were all going to be cold and rainy? That would really tank the value of my ice cream shop, right? Maybe 50%? But we don't forecast that far out. Let's say we found out an El Nino event was going to make for one bad year. That might cut say 10% from my shop. But let's say we're far out, and the likelihood of El Nino is only 50%, so it only dropped my value 5%. Then say we get a little closer to summer and the forecast gets a little more certain and we get 60% chance of El Nino. So my business drops another 1%. So that 1% weekly shift in value was just due to a slight adjustment in the long-term expectations. The markets are constantly trying to refine those expectations for the future. And as they fluctuate, you will see volatility.

Short-term news can also have an effect. If a heat wave is headed towards my shop, maybe my value with tick up a hair to account for all the extra profits I'll make in those two weeks. Irrelevant in the long run? Yes. But a 1% change is also irrelevant in the long run, so it's on the right scale. Say miraculously heat wave after heat wave hits, and my value ticks up a hair each week, week after week. By the time summer is over, I've increased the value of my business 10%, and the price has steadily been climbing, at 0.3% per week, as the good news kept rolling in. So as small changes to outlook occur, so do small changes in the price occur.

Because investors are human, you also get irrational behavior, like exuberance, or fear, which can play a role. However, keep in mind that ""exuberance"" means excitement for future profit. And ""fear"" means fear of not having future profits. So investors are still reacting to the value of the business, as best they are able. And sure, you can get some speculative games. Let's say I think Tesla sucks, but I anticipate lots of less savvy investors will be tricked into thinking Tesla is great based on the next earnings report. Maybe I'll buy in to try to ride that wave up, and get out before it crashes? Certainly a dangerous game, but some people may play that game.

Another human factor (sort of) is how much cash investors have sitting around to invest. Mail everyone stimulus checks and lock them down so they can't go out and spend it, and guess what? They buy a lot of stocks, which pushes prices up. Is it sustainable based on future profit? Time will tell.",,

I think a counterargument would be that the collective demand of consumers has voted on many of these things, and at least some investors are simply choosing to embrace trends that they have no personal control over.

For example, the move to SUVs is basically erasing all emissions gains from small cars and electrification, [based on energy predictions from the IEA](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/14/suvs-will-ensure-oil-demand-grows-for-decades-warns-iea). I have no interest in them and think they have made driving worse; but I have no control over the mass of consumers. Consumers are literally voting with their dollars for a *more* carbon-intensive lifestyle. At some point people are just going to say ""if you can't beat them, make money off them"" (which sounds like something from the Ferengi rules of acquisition).

One interesting take I saw on Bloomberg a few months ago was that XOM was facing a confluence of problems (IIRC, can't find it again - I think it was a Kara Swisher piece) from declining refining profits, shareholder demands to maintain the dividend, and pressure to move to renewables (but no money to do so effectively).

At the most general level, you make money on stock in two ways: 1) Dividend and 2) the price of the stock share increasing in the stock market.

The dividend is a cash payment to the stock holder. They are usually issued monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The dividend percent list is the total annual amount. In this case it is 6.93%. That means they are going to give shareholders 6.93% the value of the share of the stock during the year.

That is quite high. Typically it is closer to 0.5-3%.

The value of the share of stock can decrease or increase over time, regardless of the dividend.

Most growth stocks don't issue dividends. They are usually growing their business and put the cash into growing their operations. It is more common with value stocks. They are usually established companies with less room to grow, but they have a profitable business. Their stock prices might not go up as quickly, but they can issue dividends to the shareholders from their profits. Some people choose to reinvest dividends back in the same stock, so the amount people have invested in the stock grows. 

One warning, because most brokerages prominently report unrealized gains on the stock price, it is not showing gains you've made on dividends there and if you reinvest dividends it can make your unrealized gains percent be diluted from your original investment. The new reinvestments haven't had time to change in value and are averaged into the percentage. But the different types of gains: unrealized gain from your original purchase, dividends, and unrealized gains from dividend reinvestment all add together to show the cumulative investment return.",,

Their value is in turn denominated in various national currencies but the underlying value of a company is to an extent independent of this. You'll see this with national stock indexes if a currency falls- immediately after the Brexit result GBP lost a substantial amount of value, but the FTSE100 jumped by a similar amount. This is because the underlying value of the companies didn't significantly change, but the value of the currency they were denominated in did.

>This is because such a large proportion of profits for FTSE 100 companies is made in dollars. If sterling weakens then dollar revenues, once converted back into sterling, are worth more.

As such it doesn't matter whether it is denominated in USD or EUR or something else, it will be worth exactly the same. The number in each currency will vary depending on the exchange rate, but the underlying worth will be the same, and whether you buy it in USD or EUR or something else, you'll have the exact same amount in five or ten years, it makes no difference.

This is the default scenario for most ETFs, which are currency unhedged. You *can* get hedged currency ETFs, particularly in Europe, which abstract out the currency variation, but this has a cost, can work against you as easily as it can work for you so I wouldn't tend to see the point.

If you did thorough research and are confident the company will grow and the share price will appreciate significantly, you should hold onto your position when it's downtrending as long as none of the factors that brought you to your prediction for the future have changed.
Re-evaluate if unsure.

However, you shouldn't be married to a stock in regards to holding onto it when the fundamentals have changed, when something significant has changed that renders your previous prediction invalid/unrealistic. For example, if the people in charge fail at executing while the competition thrives quarter after quarter, you probably shouldn't stay in the stock just because you like the story and because it seemed promising a while back.",,

Combine that with the suddenly rapid succession of new regulations mainly about naked short selling and dealing with large defaulting market members, and it's starting to look like Wall Street is expecting some (big) members to fail in the near future, which could cause a margin call domino effect (remember the ridiculously high margin debt I mentioned earlier?)

""And even with Neves’ recent spate of acquisitions, Farfetch’s strongest selling point has always been its marketplace-style platform. The retailer enlists boutiques around the world to list their stock on Farfetch; in exchange for a base of 25% made from sales, they receive much greater exposure than they could hope to achieve on their own. For customers, this means nearly unfettered access to hundreds of different stores at once. The approach allows Farfetch to take on zero of the risk that comes with stocking its own products while culling sizable percentages of every purchase made on their site. “[The format] helps give you the benefit of having a super broad assortment without Farfetch having to take risk,” Yurma says.

Throughout the pandemic, Farfetch has been able to play hero for some of the boutiques on its network. “In many cases for these boutiques, and some of the small brands, we were the vast majority of their business if not the only source of business for a period of time,” Neves says. That’s true for folks like Marta De Megni, the owner of 519, a high-end shop in Verona, Italy that sells Rick Owens and Ann Demeulemeester. “In this special moment, being in Farfetch has been a blessing for me,” she says. 519 doesn’t have its own website—when you click the shopping buttons on the store’s online home, you’re redirected to the shop’s Farfetch page—and De Megni relays that the core of her business comes from her physical store. Farfetch helps offset that. “It helps me to sell every day and to be sure that my business can still be alive even if people coming into the shop are less than before,” she says."" (https://www.gq.com/story/farfetch-future-of-shopping)

As discussed in that article, the company has been making purchases and will likely continue to add other layers to the site - they've discussed going into beauty recently. In 2019, they bought New Guards Group (including a partnership with famed brand Off-White) and the infrastructure that came with that:

""De Giglio describes NGG as a one-stop shop that is able to connect its umbrella of brands to manufacturers, producers, embroiders, zipper providers, scent laboratories, or even marketing firms. NGG realized early on that the future of fashion was built on instantaneous rewards. The same emotional gotta-have-it-rn response that See Now, Buy Now (RIP) and the Zaras of the world are predicated on. De Giglio says the systems he’s put in place makes it possible to produce high-end T-shirts, sneakers, and leather goods in just three—three!—weeks. “It’s like luxury fast-fashion,” he told BoF. The process that makes luxury fast-fashion possible is grueling: four shifts of factory workers keep manufacturers humming 24 hours a day seven days a week. Some of these companies will also deliver product overnight.

Farfetch then is porting over the process that makes it possible for Off-White to play in the fast-paced age of Instagram. Soon, Farfetch will be able to create its own brands using this same system.""

Additionally, Farfetch has been working on offline, as well with the ""Store of the Future"" platform: https://www.voguebusiness.com/consumers/inside-the-new-browns-london-flagship-farfetch-store-of-the-future

Comparisons are made to Netflix in the articles above and in ways that's accurate: Netflix was an aggregator of other people's content and eventually used that platform to deliver more and more of their own. Farfetch will likely mostly continue to be primarily a luxury fashion tech platform (and luxury fashion being a segment where a lot of sales are still done offline) with selective purchases (like sneaker/streetwear seller Stadium Goods) that gradually continue to build out its own brand relevance in fashion. 

There was also the Alibaba/Richemont partnership last year where both made a significant investment: https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-farfetch-investment-alibaba-idUKKBN27L2Z7

It's not a huge holding but Farfetch is something that stuck around after the selling of a lot of the aggressive growth names in my portfolio in the second half of last year and early this year. I think it's a compelling, founder-lead tech platform that could certainly branch out further in a segment that still has a lot of runway when it comes to e-commerce and tech.",,

That's also not universally correct, see for example Nano or Iota.

Also, yeah ALL currencies, not just crypto need a way of handling the settlement of transactions and distribution of currencies which needs energy and costs fees.  
In theory it's true a centralized solution can be more efficient, although in practice the existing solutions often aren't that efficient because banks don't operate purely digitally nor are they optimized for efficiency or cost.  
So in practice the most energy-efficient cryptos are about as or more efficient than Visa.

It's true that cryptos tend to encounter some problems as they grow, but that's true for any new technology.  
Many are certainly perfectly usable though.   
Seems a bit odd to expect crypto to function perfectly, while when centralized legacy system have outages or problems it's somehow normal (which has been quite common lately not to mention the perpetual problemy like lack of access for the poorest).",,

I look at ROCE and if ROCE changes I look at what's driving the changes in ROCE - is it driven by financial leverage rather then business operations? Leverage produces earnings growth but not abnormal earnings growth, so any growth that is created by leverage is not to be valued. 

Then I'll look at management, track record etc although I don't put too much of my analysis into this, and also look at whether insiders are buying or dumping shares. I'll read over annual reports etc and reformulate the financial statements, looking at Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Return on Net Operating Assets (RNOA) to name a few.

Not the half that isn't US. The half that isn't US, their stock prices will bounce around in their local currencies and will be converted back into the currency the fund is denominated in (typically USD).

If you have something like VT (or the EU UCITS equivalent), it is going to hold for example Maersk, which is listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen in DKK.

Maersk's price is going to bounce around in DKK, but the fund will convert this to USD at the day's exchange rate to calculate its NAV.

If you have 1,000 shares of Maersk, they are worth ~17m DKK which is $2.78m today.

If a USD-denominated ETF holds 1,000 shares of Maersk, they are worth $2.78m.

If you continue to hold those 1,000 shares of Maersk, they are worth whatever they are worth in five years, in DKK.

If the USD-denominated ETF continues to hold those 1,000 shares of Maersk, what are they worth in five years? Exactly the same, because they are the same thing, that the fund is denominated in USD makes zero difference.",,

""Is it correct that they can mostly only increase rent (to adjust for inflation) for a maximum percentage each year?""

There is not a maximum % that they increase rent, but they have to be competitive.

There's so many different subsectors of REITs, all of which are very different/can have different fundamentals at any given time.

The market ""prices in"" events. That happens all the time and they often start pricing in an event long before you or I even imagine the event. The difference is that they don't just say, hey in the next 5 years, there's a 100% chance of a merger between boost mobile and Sprint. No, they say it's a 23.62% chance that a deal happens next year, 12% chance 2 years from now, 30% chance it gets blocked, etc. 

Then those percent chances are reworked as more news becomes available. Headline: ""they're in talks"" triggers the 12% 2 year shifting to the one year column, so it's now ~40% chance of a deal this year. So maybe the price jumps a bit that day. And say the deal would Bring the stock price from $20->$30, well on that day, it might have already been $22, and then with the news it would jump to $24/25. That way, when the final deal does, or does not happen, they are basically halfway between the two outcomes. 

Mathematically, this is how the news is supposed to affect stock prices, and sometimes does. But most times, corporate finance doesn't get the percentages right, ignores a lot of different kinds of outcomes due to unimaginative predictors, think they may have heard an inside tip, might be distracted by Covid, or by politics. Etc. 

This is why small cap companies can be mispriced more often than large cap, because it's often not worth the money and time to research the company well. And with more money in passive investing, that gives active funds less total funds to justify in each individual stock holding, further compounding the issue. But, computers are a force multiplier, so that helps one predictor get more done, but again one predictor will have biases, so it's a small offset. 

Hope that helps!",,

I think you've already seen a market this year where things that benefit have done well this year and things that do not have not. Last year was an absolutely tremendous year for growth, including ""far off"" growth stories where a product might not be on the market for a couple of years. This year is the opposite - boomer stocks/high quality growth stories that can pass off price increases are doing well, speculative/(""rapidly growing but unprofitable"") growth stories (which could have used a healthy correction anyways after last year's insane performance) have in many cases have fared badly - or in some cases horridly.",,

More often that not, anything with a lot of zeroes in front is structured like that to fool newcomers into thinking that it's cheap, and if something is set up to target newcomers, it's probably garbage or an outright scam. (eg. shib etc.) 

I'm diversified across about 20 different coins, I can recommend you a couple, but shilling alt coins in this sub is pretty frowned on. Low energy usage per transaction is in vogue at the moment. A quick google on that should point you in the right direction. I doubt that the dip has finished dipping though, so its \*probably\* a good idea to ease in slowly at the moment. One thing I can say : Altcoins lost a lot more than BTC recently and will likely bounce back harder when it turns around in the short term, but Bitcoin is likely to recover more steadily than most of the alts over the coming months, after that it is likely alt season will be in full swing again once BTC overextends and levels off a bit.  That is, of course, assuming that this week wasn't the start of the next ""crypto winter"" which some people seem to think it is. Personally I think this week was more like a cold snap at the end of spring - the perfect time to get in.",,

If you didn’t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

The profits of that company may rise or fall because the new exchange rate allows them to report better or worse earnings (e.g. if they sell in other countries as well). 

However, it does not matter in which currency you invest in that company. Suppose you buy boeing in USD or in EUR. If you use the current exchange rate, the price will be the same on both the USD and EUR denominated stock exchange. Suppose you buy 1 share and wait a few years. If you then want to sell, the price on both exchanges will again be identical when taking the exchange rate into account.

If you're focusing on sectors, then you're multiplying your risk rather than mitigating it... without necessarily improving your long term return over that of the broader index.  This is especially true if you're investing in sectors loaded with securities trading at more than 5x book value.

Regarding my personal situation: I've consistently beaten the S&P 500 index CAGR since at least 2009.  However, I'm a very different situation because of my background in finance and the amount of capital I have.  It takes me very little effort to find massively undervalued securities in otherwise solid companies, even in the current market.  That is not going to happen for most people, and certainly not year in and year out.  There's a volume of professional expertise and years of professor-led instruction that you can't substitute with going down the same checklist 5, 10, or 5000 times.  And even then, the vast majority of professionals don't beat the index.

So the odds are not in your favor.  Do you have the capacity to retire with nothing?  No, you don't, or we wouldn't be having this conversation.

545,,2021-05-23 14:11:36,t3_nj8jbm,,investing,"Hello everyone,

I come to explain a strategy i've been applying the last month. All starts [here](https://garudaswap.finance/?ref=0x9F89d55fb6DA62DE6685A3f60F1e845A813D2273), you can check their APRs     on their pools/farms, but that's not what we care about. What we care about is the STORMs section. In this moment, the apr shows ""0"", because they are lowering STORM emmisions (yes, it gives a lot of money), they are reducing it from 60/block to 50/block, not a really big change (APRs still at 200%+, just showing 0!). The interesting thing here, is that you can stake XVS (400%apr+ for example) or any listed there (all with 200% APR) tomorrow, 24/5 APR will be back to normal for you to check, but you are still being rewarded even if showing 0% apr)

**What's the trick?**

Their coin is HIGHLY volatile, if you go to their [main page](https://garudaswap.finance/?ref=0x9F89d55fb6DA62DE6685A3f60F1e845A813D2273) you can notice how their price keeps on dropping (of course, in order to mantain such an inflation) the trick here, is to put the minimum possible amount (of any coin you choosed) in order to be able to withdraw and sell after 1/2 days without transactions fees hurting you (much easier now with BNB at less than 300$) With a coin that has a 300% APR for example, thats 0,82% each day. If we put 1000$ in, we are  getting 8.2$ a day, harvesting n selling every 2 or 1 1/2 days keeps transactions costs extremely low while keeping an insane apr.

The site has 30M TVL, so it doesnt seem to be going anywhere soon.

Gas stations were out of gas by day 2 (the ones who were still operational with generators). Some looting, but that was crushed quickly by law enforcement. If you did not have a physical means to transact, you were out of luck for a week. I'm not saying this is where gold or silver would come in at all, but this is where having physical cash is important (if you hoard physical goal and silver, you should always have physical cash as well despite the 2 asset classes seemingly being in conflict with each other).

Summer 2020 race riots. Law enforcement told township residents that there may be stretches of time during that one day/night where it was the worst, where police may be unable to respond in a timely manner or respond at all. The department advised everyone stay indoors with the doors locked, and have a plan to defend themselves if need be. Half of the police force was sent to a neighboring town where rioters were attempting to loot and burn down a new mall, a Walmart, and Home Depot. Police had created a thin ""hold the line"" perimeter against the rioters and it was barely working. Rioters managed to set a portion of the mall on fire, you could see the smoke from my house. Rioters began to wander to the neighboring towns with thinned out police forces. I could hear rioter gun shots popping off in the distance throughout the night (I decided to stay up all night to protect my family). They attempted to loot a 7-Eleven 5 mins away but the 2 owners had already positioned themselves behind the counters with an AR-15 and Mini-14 drawn at the front, yelling at the rioters to not come in meanwhile the crowd kept getting larger and larger. Repeated calls to 911 to get police over were unsuccessful. The rioters broke 1 window and then when they saw what they were up against they left and looted further down the road. Adjacent township there was an attempted murder of a police officer, a borderline ambush set up by a rioter(s). They caught one of them.

The former didn't end up being as bad as other regions (NYC had a breakdown with looting in many pockets but then again they were hit much harder than we were), but the latter event above was truly an eye opener of how quickly the whole system can break down.

584,,2021-05-23 14:34:29,t3_nj8yzp,,investing,"To help give the framework of my thought process, I'll use this example: 

-- I purchase $XYZ stock at a share price of $45.00/unit.    
-- $XYZ pays an annual dividend of 3.8%    
-- **For simplicity, let's assume the stock price holds at $45/unit for eternity with no dividend cuts or increases**    
-- Annual yield = 3.8% x $45.00 = $1.71/year

-- If I earn a return of $1.71/year, I should be able to recover my original principle price of $45/unit over time    
-- $45 / $1.71 = 26.31 years

Therefore, based on the above example, I would make the argument that in **26.31 years my annual dividend returns will total $45/unit based on an annual return of 3.8% without change in stock price.**

Is this line of thinking correct?    
Am I overlooking something simple?    
Will the same principle hold for 100 shares? 1,000 shares?

**If this is correct, then why don't we all invest in dividend stocks?** It seems if you are working on any type of 20+-year horizon there is the guarantee of the stock nearly paying for itself. This doesn't even mention the re-investment of dividends or the possibility of dividend increases over that period! _It almost seems to easy...?_

To save some time, I note these drawbacks/limitations to my line of thought:    
1) Dividends can be cut (and they often are!)    
2) Share price can be depressed, in turn impacting dividend yield potential significantly over time    
3) Stock dilution (seems unlikely as most dividend paying firms are stable/blue-chip type companies)    
4) Time in market (hypothesis needs a longer timeframe to play out)

A victim of one of the half a dozen other things I mentioned above, would strongly disagree with your assessment of their suffering  as you elegantly phrased it as ""nuance in every industry"".

It is not my place to say if that judgment is or isn't correct though, but at this point it would be stubborn not to realize that you cannot have a discussion on morality without judgment. So either you aren't serious about having a real discussion, or you knew exactly what you were trying to stir up with your post. Only you have the answer to that.

Definitely don't think it's a fraud, it's just a very aggressive growth fund that never dials their bullishness on hyper growth down at all. She sells big, high quality into downturns and builds up more into smaller, more speculative positions where she already owns 10%+ of the company.  As long as growth bounces, great. If there was a more sustained downturn in growth, might be problematic. There's already been some minor selling of concentrated positions lately (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-22/cathie-wood-is-trimming-her-biggest-stakes-as-ark-funds-stumble)

The one thing that I do think helps them is that I do think that there is a generation of investors who is interested in investing in what they are excited about for the future and I don't think any fund sort of is the face of that more than Ark - which has been helped by their marketing. The funds are down a lot but there really has been very little AUM outflow - still a net inflow YTD. If growth continues to fare like it has lately there may be outflows in the months ahead but  I really do think that a lot of younger people invest primarily in themes they're excited about and if growth underperforms a lot of them will probably stick with the growth playbook rather than try to adjust.",,

I ran some projections on dividend spreadsheets for my 401k, and it was around 15-20 years that the dividends would start to out pace my yearly contributions.  After that, however, they took off.

You can realistically find a 5-7% return on a dividend portfolio and still maintaining a diverse spectrum of exposure.

With the increase of renewable energy power systems are gonna face an interesting problem: negative price. 

Negative price is the situation where there is a non flexible demand and a strong non flexible offer. 

In other words, it is becoming very common situation in which the production from renewable is high and at the same time conventional resources like nuclear power or gas power are kept on because the cost of temporary shutting down plants is costly. 

This is a global problem. Countries around the world have been or are gonna be experienced. 

Storage ti offset the grid when there is excess of production can be the solution.

Any idea about stocks in this field? Only SIEMENS?",nj9vfs,Who are the players in energy grid storage?

I will make the bold assumption that you're living in America. From the terms I see in the comment, it feels like you're coming at it at a very academic angle, like betting on the bounce back or something.

Geo-political risk here is at an *ACCELERATION* point. Hong Kong news right now is ridiculous. Let me give you 2 examples. 1. Chief of secret police in Hong Kong was suspended on prostitution charges (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Choi#Career, see the references) 2. Mayor of the city is announcing that a civil servant exchange program with mainland. (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3133100/hong-kong-send-more-civil-servants-across-border-greater, SCMP is subtly pro-china media btw)

People in local forums are so into American markets now, a lot of people my age have given up on local stocks; and even the city itself?

Answering your question: How long is that drag gonna last? Hong Kong is seeing a wave of mass exodus. People are withdrawing their pension money because they are actually at the working ages but fleeing the city. Again, people my age are constantly talking about emigrating. Capital is leaving the city, not coming in. How will equities here produce good returns in the long run?

Stocks did go up briefly earlier, but it's slowly falling back down. I think it's pretty clear that the brief surge was to BUY UP local conglomerates like HSBC (at a loss), as a political move, so to obtain a substantial majority in key industries, to further silence employees in the future.",,

To your point about the price dropping after dividend payment, but my understanding is that typically this cycle plays out for dividend paying stocks:

1) Stocks rises prior to strike date to ""true"" value level as everyone tries to get in on the dividend payment
2) Strike date elapses, and money rushes out as the ""dividend is already secured""
3) Over the course of the next dividend cycle, stock price will rise back up as dovetail with Point #1 and reset the cycle

825,,2021-05-23 16:52:49,t3_njbr4t,,investing,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",njbr4t,The Weekly DD - IPOE/SoFi: Powering the Future (FinTech)

Growth stocks are generally considered less-risky than value stocks. Companies do not set a dividend %; they set the payout amount and the yield is determined by the stock price. 

The dividend on stocks like T are high because the market is pricing in their lack of growth. Generally, value stocks are considered riskier because companies that are growing (growth stocks) are in a better position and may outcompete them.

The main risk of growth stocks is when the market prices-in too much growth.

One great example of this is Apple. A few years ago, the market did not have a lot of growth priced-in and it was trading at 12 P/E because the pivot to services was much greater than expected. The yield was higher then even though Apple is now paying more now precisely because growth is expected.",,

There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings.",nbxa4m,"A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs Coinbase, DoorDash, Bumble, Wish, and Coupang record all-time low stock prices this week"

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).",nbqj5j,The role of bonds in a portfolio

Not accurate...

From July 1984 to now, T share price is up **505%**.  A $10,000 investment would be worth $50,500. Alone over 37 years not great, but dividends do matter...especially for value oriented stocks.

Using a dividend reinvestment calculator, a $10,000 purchase in July 1984 would be worth $1,399,977,44 today, if left alone.

So you end up with 140x your original investment. It is an annualized return rate of 14.5%

Now in the last 10-20 years, results haven't been so good. Anyone who initially bought in between '98 or '01 made a bad investment. After that, it is still been getting annualized returns near 7%, if you reinvest the dividend.

T has some real challenges ahead. They are getting extra competition and needing to adjust to technological innovation affecting some lines of their business. But they can't be short-changed that badly... 

&#x200B;

You're using a split stock chart incorrectly. The reason the raw price of the share drops when it is split, is they issue the shareholders 2x or 3x the stock depending on the split.
