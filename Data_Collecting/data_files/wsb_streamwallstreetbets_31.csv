If you lined up the minute candles starting from 930 am amc spiked and started falling. Smart traders got out with profit and searched for the next move. Drove up calls massively with an IV spike. Because IV hit 300 percent. Then people took there profits and collapsed it all. People got trapped in AMC and BB Friday. 

You seem very experienced, I am not still learning. But I did write this to help newbs. I’m afraid some people who just use Robinhood saw the green dildos and just chased. When there were warning signs not to Friday.

1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.
5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

89,,2021-05-30 16:43:35,t3_nof1wp,,wallstreetbets,"Here are MOST of the reasons AMC is almost inevitably gonna squeeze.

IT IS ALMOST INEVITABLE

* Crypt0 just had an absolute pump and dump and there are retail investors with billions of dollars waiting to be spent and will see AMC start to rise and be greedy cause they have the money to do so.
* If you were to scale the current AMC chart with the beginning of the volkswagon squeeze as well as the beginning of the squeezes in february and almost any other squeeze. we are compared to the absolute beginning. they compare almost exactly alike
* the brokerages had had their options chain up to 39 all week, in-fact i think its stayed there since the squeeze in february, and at the end of the week the brokerages add options up to 70 which is almost triple what the current price is. this means the brokerages are preparing for it to at least triple possibly. this upgrade on that type of level never happens
* the number of calls that expired ITM on Friday was over 100,000, being the price was at 25.69 after the the SMALL sell off. if that sell off didn't happen and the price settled above 39 every single call would have been ITM, thats over 300,000. the market makers would have had to pay the 300,000 calls which would have made the squeeze possibly happen on friday.
* there have been almost 0 short shares available to borrow because over the past three months you need to understand that hedge funds have just been constanty shorting it to the point where there were 0 shorts left to fucking get, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, you dont understand the level of fuckery that is about to happen because of this. there being 0 shorts available to borrow quite literally means there backs are up against a fucking massive iron wall of steel that is almost impossible to break through, that is why it is almost inevitable this squeeze happens.
* most of their shorts are at or below $15 and there are plenty of levels of resistance at and above $15
* the stock has gained so much popularity over the past week that it has tripled, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TRIPLE WAS NOTHING, THAT TRIPLE WAS JUST PEOPLE BUYING IN BEFORE THE SQUEEZE, THE SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE HEDGE FUNDS COVER THEIR SHORTS WHICH IS LOOKING LIKE ITS GOING TO HAVE TO BE NEXT WEEK. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY OFF THEIR SHORTS

1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.

156,,2021-05-30 16:47:08,t3_nof4e8,,wallstreetbets,"HERE ARE SOME FACTS SURROUNDING AMC 

* If you were to scale the current AMC chart with the beginning of the volkswagon squeeze as well as the beginning of the squeezes in february and almost any other squeeze. we are compared to the absolute beginning. they compare almost exactly alike
* the brokerages had had their options chain up to 39 all week, in-fact i think its stayed there since the squeeze in february, and at the end of the week the brokerages add options up to 70 which is almost triple what the current price is. this means the brokerages are preparing for it to at least triple possibly. this upgrade on that type of level never happens
* crypt0 just had an absolute pump and dump and there are retail investors with billions of dollars waiting to be spent and will see AMC start to rise and be greedy cause they have the money to do so.
* the number of calls that expired ITM on Friday was over 100,000, being the price was at 25.69 after the the SMALL sell off. if that sell off didn't happen and the price settled above 39 every single call would have been ITM, thats over 300,000. the market makers would have had to pay the 300,000 calls which would have made the squeeze possibly happen on friday.
* there have been almost 0 short shares available to borrow because over the past three months you need to understand that hedge funds have just been constanty shorting it to the point where there were 0 shorts left to fucking get, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, you dont understand the level of fuckery that is about to happen because of this. there being 0 shorts available to borrow quite literally means there backs are up against a fucking massive iron wall of steel that is almost impossible to break through, that is why it is almost inevitable this squeeze happens.
* most of their shorts are at or below $15 and there are plenty of levels of resistance at and above $15
* the stock has gained so much popularity over the past week that it has tripled, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TRIPLE WAS NOTHING, THAT TRIPLE WAS JUST PEOPLE BUYING IN BEFORE THE SQUEEZE, THE SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE HEDGE FUNDS COVER THEIR SHORTS WHICH IS LOOKING LIKE ITS GOING TO HAVE TO BE NEXT WEEK. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY OFF THEIR SHORTS

In the market sndl has the most opened int. On call options, and as of friday sndl and amc both had almost the same amount of volume of around 400 million shares traded.
The float for sndl is smaller than amc's.
Amc has a float of around 400 million shares and sndl has 300.
Why should you care?
The gamma of amc propped by all the call options itm, pushed the price high in a rocket fueled, gamma squeeze.
Sndl is on the same situation as amc was last week, all it needs is for gamma to keep exploding. Which looks like it.
So next week look at sndl, put it on your watch list and make money from it, so you can buy more GME and AMC!

If you think it's going to rocket to $500 like many on here say, then I would say the math is pretty clear that a $25/S investment for $475/S profit is pretty good.

If you think it's going to continue upward, but not as far as others think, maybe $50, then I would still say a clean doubling is a good investment.

If you think it's going down then I would personally recommend that you don't invest.

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

**Recognizing Industry Leaders Across Multiple Segments**

The growth in electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) is climbing; by 2025, EVs and HEVs will account for an estimated 30% of all vehicle sales.\[1\]  The US EV market is expected to reach 6.9M unit sales by 2025.\[2\]  By 2030, Deloitte forecasts China to achieve a domestic market share of around 48% – almost double that of the United States (27%), and Europe should achieve 42%; growth will be accelerated in countries offering incentives.\[3\]

&#x200B;

[Major Market Outlooks - to 2030](https://preview.redd.it/8s96nsg6ba271.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=413dcf673d60a5134ba01ec45762cdc7eb2c0fe2)

While the United States and China have been the two largest markets for EVs, European growth is speeding up. In Q1 2020, European EV sales rose as the overall EV penetration rate increased to 7.5 percent. So far, several countries are discussing additional purchase incentives as part of their economic stimulus programs. 

&#x200B;

[penetration growth, Q1 2019 vs Q1 2020](https://preview.redd.it/29n1rgyefa271.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=905b66003433c6d6aea96ca01e17f45fd8cc2f9f)

This transition is accelerated by growth in per-capital income in developing countries. The automotive market in 2025 will see around 120m vehicles sold, with China comprising 35m of sales. Considering the penetration rate for Electric vehicles, we can expect +30m global EV sales, with China and Europe leading at +10.5m and +5m sales, respectively. 

&#x200B;

[EV Segments as &#37; of Auto Market](https://preview.redd.it/ievgu8klfa271.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be5989c166d385389152e51c3a61517c8259327)

For both North America and Europe, hybrids and BEVs are set to lead over the next decade as plug-in hybrids are not proving too popular in either region. In Europe, plug-in electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) will rise from roughly a 2% share of total new sales in 2017 to around 9% by 2025.

**Moving forward, accurate results and revenue forecasts will be determined by these key questions:**

***1. How is the speed of competition compared to the speed of industry growth?***

***2. What is the efficacy of government incentives on consumers?***

***3. How are startups able to differentiate their products?***

**Segment Discussion**

With these questions, now we examine the segmentation and distribution of the industry. Electric Vehicles have multiple avenues of growth opportunities; some recent developments include startups like Lordstown Motors, Workhorse Group, and Canoo.  

https://preview.redd.it/uph3o4wmga271.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdde0ff0c828bbf9849f656c0a9058aad093e9d

Strong opportunities exist outside consumer vehicles, as the competitive landscape intensifies. Small startups that wish to combine EV and Autonomous Driving technology also try to find their niche in fleet vehicles focused on light-duty and delivery services.

Within consumer vehicles, BEVs and Hybrids are likely to take the lead, with long-term trends favoring BEVs. I believe Plug-In Hybrids in a very awkward position, having to compete against existing hybrid options and new battery vehicles. However, they are also viable in locations with poor charging infrastructure. Specifically, I think two questions will be critical in determining the future of Plug-In Hybrids.  1. How fast is charging infrastructure expanding in relation to EV sales? 2. What are the markets that have high incentives but poor charging infrastructure? 

&#x200B;

[Market Remains Fragmented as of 2019](https://preview.redd.it/ctwu1xf4ha271.png?width=1937&format=png&auto=webp&s=7016e710092649594a8054e29f69a55fa9bc4560)

 **Conclusion and picks**

Within consumer vehicles, luxury and basic vehicle models must also be distinguished. Thus, we distinguish key winners in their separate spaces.

Within Luxury EVs, NIO is set to be the clear winner with strong growth vs. peers, smart expansion in high-penetration markets, and effective subsidy schemes. 

Within normal models, markets continue to remain fragmented as EV companies fail to break out of home markets. Winners likely come from established global brands, like Ford and GM.

In light-duty/transport space, clear leaders in the innovation-production pipeline include Lordstown motors and Renault-Nissan.

Safe defensive picks come from large Auto-conglomerates with expansive EV portfolios like BYD, BAIC, and Renault, having a portfolio of products across multiple segments.

The maybe consider a PMCC. Poor man’s covered call. Google it for videos explaining it. Basically, you sell a higher strike call and collect premium. Perfect time would have been Friday morning when amc spiked. Then you could have bought the call back and made some money. For example, the 40c 6/4 call hit a high of 9.25 in the morning. It closed at 2.10. You could have made over 700 dollars per contract. Look it’s straight gambling with AMC. If by 6/4 it was gonna close in the money you would have to buy it back, roll it out to a further date or close both the call you sold and your longer term call to help cover the loss. 

But it’s a good way to make some extra money while waiting. The longer dated call you sell the more time you have to get out with a profit because of the ups and downs of the stock. Go to tastyworks they have great videos on options.

This asshole had stolen a ton of money from his elderly parents and I represented the family.

For those not aware, depos aren’t done in a courtroom; they’re typically done in a conference room, at a big conference table. So this asshole is sitting across the table from me, along with his counsel. The defendant asshole isn’t being deposed that day, it was some other person. 

So at one point the witness is about to say something sort of bad for this guy. I knew it was coming so I was watching the asshole to see what his reaction would be.  

To be clear, this wasn’t some sort of Perry Mason, “devastating to his case” moment.  It was just something that made him look like a dick. 

Anyway, he’s sitting there, kinda slack-jawed, watching and listening to the witness. He may not have known what was coming, I couldn’t tell. So she says the thing, he recoils slightly and then instantly snaps his head around to look at me, probably to see what my reaction was.

But, I was watching *him*, not the witness, so when he snaps his head to see my reaction, he finds me staring right at him (it’s possible I had my resting-condescending-face on). Basically he hangs a sharp right turn and runs face first into a lamppost. The dude’s eyes bulge*.* 

*Deer in the headlights.* 

I‘m not sure where it came from or what made me do it, but without missing a beat, I winked at him. 

*AND. HE. LOST. HIS. FUCKING. MIND.* 

Dude LEAPS up, knocking his chair over,  and starts SCREAMING—  

“HE WINKED AT ME! HE ***FUCKING*** ***WINKED AT ME!!!!***“ 

I think he *may* have been jumping up and down and screaming this, like a toddler, but I’m not sure — because it was absolute *pandemonium*. 

He scared the SHIT out of EVERYONE. There’s like 30 people in the room. We’re hours into this thing, and most of the people in the room are half-asleep or asleep. You could hear shit getting knocked over and chairs squealing on the floor as people recoiled in shock. Someone *screamed*. 

His attorney, who is just a little guy, nearly gets knocked out of his chair. He‘s  in complete shock, so I jump up and start yelling at him, *demanding* that he get his client under control. He tries to pull himself together and find out the identiy of this evil winking bastard, but his client is practically hysterical. Eventually, the asshole realizes that no one knows what the fuck he is talking about, so he points straight at me and yells - 

”IT WAS *HIM!* *HE WINKED AT ME!!!*” 

Someone behind me laughs, making me laugh for a second, but I quickly regain my composure, point at myself and ask incredulously, “Who? ME?!?“ The court reporter, who I’ve known for years, laughs. *Loudly*. I look at her and she’s trying to hide her face, which is fucking beet red. She clearly realized, “OH FUCK HE DEFINITELY WINKED AT THAT GUY.“ 

This causes me to momentarily panic as I realize, “Oh, fuck, *everyone in here is going to believe that I did this*.” 

But, for some reason, the laughter *completely* deflates this asshole. His shoulders drop and he kind of hangs his head. His attorney quickly asks for a recess, which I agree to - “I think that’s in your client’s best interest, yes.” 

We take 15 minutes, quickly finish up the depo, and a couple of weeks later, settle the entire thing. 

And that’s how I won a case with a 😉.",,

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

After having lost and made 30k, twice, on berkshire class b yolo calls, I decided I would stop being a degenerate option buyer and switch over to ""being the casino"", as it were.

Well, one of the habits I should have abandoned during that transition was diamond-handing my losses/gains.

Thought I'd cheer myself up with a vid of my performance.

Delta has to do with how the option price relates to the underlying share price. It tells you how much your option will gain in value if the underlying moves 1$. 

Delta doesn't stay constant throughout the life of an option contract, though. The way delta changes is the next greek gamma. If the underlying changes by 1$, gamma tells you how much the new delta will be. The closer an option is to expiration, the higher gamma is and thus the faster delta can change. 

Speaking of expiration, theta tells you how much value your option will lose over one day if all else stays the same.",,

709,,2021-05-30 17:20:04,t3_nofsuf,,wallstreetbets,"Adam Aron posted on Twitter today advising Apes in Europe and UK to ask their brokerages about voting and to switch brokers if they wouldn't allow it. It sounded like there are significant numbers of voters overseas. This is great, but also worrisome if their votes are being suppressed and/or overseas brokers aren't giving AMC (or GME or others) accurate (or any) shareholder info. 

Could this be an actual strategy used by market makers to sell millions (billions overall) of naked shorts? Sell outside of the US system where the record keeping is not shared. The brokers there profit, the market makers here profit, but the shareholders there never get to exercise their shareholder rights like voting and so are rarely, if ever counted. However they can still sell their shares, their shares can still be lent out and rehypothecated, and our companies are diluted in a huge way. 

It really worries me that perhaps CEOs and companies cannot get truly accurate shareholder counts if a large percentage of shares are owned overseas and those brokers aren't obligated to let them vote and don't have to disclose shareholder info to companies. This has the potential to be a massive weapon in the market makers arsenal. Naked short sell into outside markets where it will never be counted,  but will have a major dilution effect.

Is there any way to find out? Would Wes Christian,  Lucy Komisar, Ryan Cohen, Jim Savaldi or someone else with a lot of experience know? Any other wrinkled brain apes see any previous DD on this?

If this is an actual threat and not just paranoia on my part, we need to strategize on how to bring this to light. Having an accurate share count helps us know the extent of the Naked Shorting, an accurate Days to Cover and therefore helps estimate a realistic peak and exit strategy. Plus it's just so fucking wrong if they are able to circumvent the system this way. 

Thoughts?
