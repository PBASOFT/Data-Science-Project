Doesnt matter if they give a dividend though I would recommend it. When you are young, your goal is to learn, not to become an overnight slumdog. 

Dividends are nice because they give you a shot of cash to play with which encourages you to do more research (learn) and buy more stuff. Never use DRIPs when young (or ever if you plan to be active). Learn to do things yourself. Again, the goal between 18-30ish is to learn. For every slumdog there are 9 others who have to start over at 30. Stick to BKLC and VTI.

As you get older and wiser, thats when you should start taking more sophisticated positions. 30s is probably the right time (giver or take) because, odds are, you have faced at least one bear market and one inflated sector pump and dump by then and learned from it.

It is in the toy industry, so while cyclical, it has very predictable seasonality and income flow. It's online presence is insane, they have exclusive rights to so many franchises and caters strongly to the ""nerd"" crowd and they are very willing to spend on their hobbies. While I am not really in that scene, I have many friends who are and they love their Funko. Not just that people resell their Funko pops for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. So collectors get into it too. Kids love it as well, they have toys that cater to hem as well. All while having a very iconic design, making it very marketable yet adaptable to new franchises. Very large addressable market. Smaller cap than Hasbro or Mattel so they have a larger growth runway and they are more nimble and their management seems to be in touch with their core fanbsse and understands what they want. 

Not to mention their foray into NFTs but tbh I don't really understand that scene so I can't say much. To me it's a nice bonus but not really the main selling point to me.

I got in very early too at ~$10 so that's nice. This is just a summary of my thesis, writing out the full analysis would take more effort than I am willing to do",,

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning after the spike up.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day.

Using this as an overall experience to: 1. Not have paper hands and panic sell at a loss, and most importantly, 2. Don't day trade meme stocks over with high volatility of it's value over months.  Might be a squeeze today I think and I paperhanded it, but you know what, I don't care, it was annoying wondering if it's ever going up or tank to sub 10s for the foreseeable future.

You only need to look at modern examples (standard oil comes to mind) to see how breaking up monopolies benefited shareholders immensely. Standard oil was broken up into 34 separate companies and many of those become some of the largest and most powerful companies today. Not only did it increase the share prices of these forms, it more than quintupled JD Rockefeller net worth. 

In general companies that become very large can become very fragile ( think aig) when a company that large fails, there are significant impacts to the market and their own shareholders. By breaking up monopolies into smaller parts companies the market can become more “antifragile” (if you don’t know what that means go read the book by Taleb) but essentially it prevents the greater possibility of significant and harmful effects (aka market crash or company bankruptcy).",,

The way I see it, last year/January was a sneak peek of how well these growth stocks have the ability to do, but not all of them will make it. The ones that are genuine good companies will soar, but not every growth stock is a good company. I see that OP you mentioned SPCE and TSLA. I don't see SPCE making it just personally, and I feel like Tesla has seen its insane growth run and will now be pretty dormant until another major catalyst comes, which might be a while.

196,gzfd2kh,2021-05-25 19:19:13,t1_gzfd2kh,t1_gzelxxn,stocks,"In relation to the operations of the company itself? 

The company is in the process of swiftly overhauling its entire business strategy with Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy at the helm. And there's optimism and an element of hype behind the process in a nutshell. 

Given the success of Chewy, with its focus on excellent customer service, achieving customer loyalty, planning and setting up of its fulfillment centers and logistics network for delivering its products, the idea is that Ryan Cohen is someone who has credible experience and understanding of constructing successful ecommerce businesses. 

An ecommerce business that could still exist and compete, despite juggernauts like Amazon already existing and having a sizeable foothold in the sector. 

In August 2020, it's revealed he purchased a ~13% stake of the company, which suddenly makes him a major shareholder. 

Being an activist investor, this caused rumblings about whether he was going to step in and play a more ""active"" role in shaping the future of the company. Otherwise, what did he see in this supposedly dying company that he would go in and buy a huge chunk of it? 

A couple of months go by without a lot of noise, when all of a sudden, a filing through the SEC reveals that Cohen (through his investment firm) officially sent the company's board an aggressive letter basically saying how much the video game market has grown over the past decade, how the company has failed to capitalize on it and obtain market share, and refuses to change its antiquated ways at the expense of the shareholders. 

It turns out he tried reaching out to board members several times beforehand to discuss needing to change things up, and all attempts fell on deaf ears and were given cold shoulders. This just emboldened him, ""well if you guys aren't gonna take this seriously, then I'll just take it to the next level.""

January 2021, it's announced Cohen officially gains board seats, not only for himself, but also for two former Chewy executives, the CFO (Jim Grube) and CMO (Alan Attal). He's effectively consolidating power over the company in order to steer it the way he wants. 

March, news surfaces that the company's CFO and CCO (Chief Customer Officer) are resigning in a sign of upper management/C-suite shakeup. Hires of former high-level employees of Amazon, Walmart, and Chewy are announced, to swiftly begin the reconstruction of the business.

April, CEO George Sherman looks to be given the boot as it's announced he's also resigning and the company announces that it's in the process of searching for a successor that will be fit to execute the company's new vision. The board announces Ryan Cohen is the planned new chairman of the board after the voting from the annual shareholder meeting in June takes place.

This guy has essentially gained massive power over the company in a relatively short period of time, and is supposedly hellbent on transforming it into a highly profitable business.",,
197,gzfd4q2,2021-05-25 19:19:38,t1_gzfd4q2,t1_gzfd2kh,stocks,"One of the biggest concerns for many years was GameStop's high level of debt. And, this was also one of the reasons for the shorters' high conviction over the doom of the company. 

Well ... in the beginning of May, the company announced it took advantage of the elevated price of GME, issued ~3.5 million shares to the market, and raised roughly half a billion dollars. 

And ... supposedly with this new war chest, paid off essentially all of its outstanding debt. The debt that shorters thought had the company cornered and set to crumble.

Now, the question is, is the current price of GME somewhat reasonable or completely whacko. 
I am of the opinion that it may be high, but it's really not that insane given all the supposedly positive things happening within the company that point to massive change and its valuation relative to market conditions. 

At its current range, it moves between 10B-20B, which I can understand people wanting to say it's high af. 

However, look at our current market environment. We have a ton of companies doing less than 500M, 300M, 200M in revenue a quarter ... some barely profitable, many aren't profitable at all ... being valued at 20B, 30B, 50B ... 90B+ ... DDOG, CRWD, NET, DKNG, DASH ... SHOP is at 153B valuation off <1B quarterly revenue. 

Yet, somehow GME with 2B+ revenue last quarter at something like 15B valuation is completely bonkers and deserves more criticism and spotlight compared to all these other, imo, more bonkers companies.

Even Chewy itself has revenue/earnings comparable to GameStop, yet was valued at nearly 50B just 3 months back.

The thing that GameStop doesn't have compared to many of these other companies is actual revenue growth.
Its revenue figures completely stagnated for many years, and began dropping the past couple.

I'm not saying these are bad companies or anything. And comparing GameStop to these other companies isn't exactly apples to apples. I just don't understand when people call GameStop insanely overvalued, but conveniently fail to associate all these other instances of even more outlandish valuations. 

If the company can reestablish growth, its valuation is gonna go way past what it is now judging by how the stocks of all these other companies have performed.

Now, as for the whole ""squeeze"" and the superstonk community, yeah, there's a lot of nuttiness and straight-up conspiracy theory there. I've lost track of the number of times the community believed something was gonna happen on some date, and nothing of significance ends up happening unsurprisingly. 

However, I also don't believe that there's absolutely nothing fishy going on with the short situation. 

Some of the accusations on naked shorting, hiding shorts, DTCC being irresponsible, SEC not doing their job do have merit to an extent. However, I believe a lot of the theories there put it all on steroids, and the actual truth is somewhere in the middle. 

The '$10 Million is the Floor' is completely loco.
However, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a further squeeze either. 
It would be a couple thousand at best imo.

There just isn't a whole lot of transparency. 
And there are tactics to hide the size of positions from public knowledge.
So, the amount of actual exposure currently at stake against GME isn't clear.",,

Your arbitrary time period doesn’t mean anything. Expand that time period to a year and they have massive growth. Nothing about that predicts the future. You can choose any combination of time periods to fit whatever scenario you are looking for.

Says what? Says who? Why do *you* know this and everyone else doesn’t? Where’s your proof? 

>Wall street spent months talking about moving out of growth and going to cyclicals

No. The talking heads talked about their analysis of money flow.

The money flow is entirely obvious. Pandemic destroyed cyclicals, so money flows out of that into tech/medical. Pandemic eases, money slowly flows back into cyclical. But we also see money flowing into commodities. So now we get to predict where money flows back into. Or does it just settle to pre-covid. Most analysts see the money flowing to the most reasonable forward earnings; that is not tech. 

Just because a once in a century event inflated the price of a stock, doesn’t mean that price is representative of the company’s outlook. The price movements in 2020 were not organic. 

>so eventually they’ll go back

Again, where’s your proof? Why do you know what they are going to do with their money when they don’t even know yet?

I’m willing to wager you have not evaluated any of these growth stocks for future earnings and are basing all of your decisions on the 1Y stock chart and wishful thinking that everything is guaranteed to return to 52W highs and you started calculating your returns.

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

These communities are basically support groups for people who make sketchy investments, just like a cult or people falling for a scam.

And yes, I've read the GME ""DD"". I understand the short squeeze aspect. But nothing in there suggests that the price of GME will actually hit astronomical levels, in the tens of thousands or even millions. The people who believe that are idiots and just don't understand law.

Yes, you can say ""hedge funds are required to cover shorts"". But where does the money come from? That's like saying that homeowners are ""required to pay their mortgage"". Yes, they do. But sometimes they don't. And they get foreclosed on. You can't take money from someone who is out of money.

There's no situation where a hedge fund will be paying $10k/share for GME to cover a short position. They will go bankrupt before that happens.

People who make comments saying that they're poor and they hold one share hoping that it goes to $10M so they can escape poverty are gullible idiots with no financial knowledge and it's sad that the GME groups are taking advantage of people like that, propping them up, and offering them moral support instead of kicking them in the ass and telling them to get a fucking grip on reality.

304,gzfhlwk,2021-05-25 19:51:18,t1_gzfhlwk,t1_gzd1hax,stocks,"The market is saturated, but the way I see it is that Peloton is like Apple. I personally know people who love Peloton and would probably buy anything if it had Peloton branding. That is eerily similar to Apple. I remember when Apple was consistently making inferior products compared to Samsung and yet they sold out because of their loyal customers. 

On top of that, they also sell clothing. Owning Peloton product is a statement just like owning Apple product as a statement. One of the biggest reasons why Peloton hasn't been profitable is because of the massive amount of money they have put into marketing and development. They spend roughly 40-60% of their yearly revenue on marketing per year. They truly are positioning themselves to become the top of the line industry-standard company. If you're deciding to buy or sell Peloton stock based on the performance of yesterday and today, you are buying and selling the stock with the wrong intention. This is a long term hold, in my opinion this is the fitness version of getting into AAPL in the early generations of the iPhone. Peloton is a huge disruption in their industry when you take into account the full company and not just the production side of it. Like someone else said, other companies sell future yard-sale equipment. Peloton sells an experience, and if a person buys the bike and subscribes to their business model, it'll take 4 years to make the same gross revenue from their subscription as they did with the bike. I get that 4 years is a lot of time, but other companies aren't adding that kind of value to their product. Other companies bucks stop once the customer has purchased the equipment",,

The predatory shorting of the stock is actually what’s causing the price to rise. You watch June 23rd you’re going to watch this bitch hit 88mph and then you’ll see some serious shit.

They are not inherently bad investments and though their price action is correlated, the businesses should not be compared to each other at all.

SLDB has been developing genetic therapeutics for years and is not profitable. However; given that the mRNA vaccines have shown to have tremendous value I would say it seems possible that they will be discovered since they have years and years of mRNA research in hand.

As for your other advice:

You posted about the market getting too hot in Feb 2021 and indicated you were bearish. Since then Dow and S&P are up 7-8%.

You posted a short term price target for CGC of $100 a few months ago which would have been a 150% return on current price. CGC has since fallen 40% to $24.

Your price target of SPCE indicates a 150% annual return in a mere two years. Pretty easy to tell that one will fall flat.

I eventually grew my 7k(?) account to 26k in January, and I remember it being a milestone for me specifically because I wanted the 25k threshold to day trade. 

Now fast forward to GME. I thought it was pretty funny at first, since I was a member of WSB starting in November, but tbh I had no interest in sticking up to short sellers, and still don't. I think they're jerks obviously, but I'm more focused on making my own money. I think around when GME hit $400ish, EVERYTHING in my portfolio went down, since people were dumping their stocks for meme stocks. That meant that my swings were pretty ruined, so I felt really left out, and kinda cheated. I had done my DD, I learned all of these fancy indicators, but the guys who invested in a company that gave me $3 for Halo 3 got loaded.

So against my better judgement and eeeeveerryyything i learned, I bought GME, BB, and AMC all around their tops. The volatility spikes were so crazy, Webull couldn't keep up with them.

&#x200B;

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

&#x200B;

>[https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2](https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2)

>Image visualizing Enthusiast Gaming overall structure.

&#x200B;

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

&#x200B;

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

For disclosure, I have not got any position in Enthusiast Gaming. Above are just snippets of the research I've been doing and what some analysts are saying. I would like to hear your opinion on this company too.

My question now is if I should sell all and wait for a good opportunity to buy again? Trading fees will likely cost ~2% of the portfolio - should I stay invested and wait, maybe keep extra money for now? 
All companies I am invested in seem to be doing okayish business-wise. XOM is still down 10% , some other 30% - but during Corona even the most solid companies droped 40% easy.

Excerpt:

> But VW isn't about to let a crisis go to waste. Instead of letting dust collect on the plant's machinery and many workers being sent home, upgrades will take place on the assembly line focusing on quality improvements and other related areas.

> In addition, workers will continue training and preparation to build the ID.4 all-electric crossover. At present, the ID.4 is only built alongside its ID.3 hatchback sibling at VW's Zwickau plant in Germany.

### Media Release

**Munich, May 20, 2021:** Lilium GmbH (“Lilium”), positioned to be a global leader in regional electric air mobility with the development of its electric vertical take-off and landing jet (“Lilium Jet”), and Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group, one of the largest business aircraft and helicopter operators worldwide, today announced that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

Lilium’s vision for a flexible transportation ecosystem is supported by world-class partners. Luxaviation Group brings over 60 years of experience operating passenger service with hundreds of aircraft under management and 10 Air Operator Certificates (“AOCs”) across Europe.

Building on Luxaviation Group's track record, which includes securing the first European Union Aviation Safety Agency AOC approval for a business jet operator, the parties anticipate Luxaviation Group will become responsible for parts of the airline operations being developed by Lilium. This includes securing necessary approvals and managing pilots, which will be trained following a type rating concept developed by Lufthansa Aviation Training, another Lilium partner. As Lilium continues developing its launch networks in Europe for the planned commercial launch in 2024, Luxaviation Group will also work with Lilium on the development of its best-in-class customer experience, built around Lilium’s digital airline platform and the 7-Seater Lilium Jet.

“We are proud to be working alongside Luxaviation Group, a leading operator in the aviation sector with a track record in offering an innovative and customer-focused service, to build out the Lilium network in Europe. This marks a key milestone as we prepare for launch, and we look forward to working together to provide an exceptional airline service for our passengers,” explains Remo Gerber, Chief Operating Officer at Lilium.

Patrick Hansen, Group CEO at Luxaviation Group said: “Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft will fundamentally change the way we travel, and the Lilium network is poised to be at the forefront of this sea change in aviation”. Christophe Lapierre, Head of Strategy of Luxaviation Group adds: “We are very pleased to have been selected by Lilium to be their partner in aircraft operations. As an early believer in advanced air mobility, we look forward to bringing our experience and credentials to the partnership with Lilium and building out a service that will truly feel like a first of its kind.”

Lilium has previously announced plans for launch networks in Germany through partnerships with Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, and Cologne/Bonn airports.

Working in partnership with world-leading aerospace, technology and infrastructure partners, commercial operations are planned to launch in 2024. Lilium’s 600+-strong team includes over 400 aerospace engineers and a leadership responsible for delivering some of the most successful aircraft in aviation history.

People aren’t going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less?

Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple´s price is higher right now, I don´t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I´ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.

529,,2021-05-24 20:28:49,t3_nk7ipu,,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it’s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed’s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, “I do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.”

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year.

2 Key Things From 3D Systems' Earnings Call That Investors Should Know | NASDAQ

Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD reported first-quarter 2021 results that easily beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock skyrocketed 35% the next day.

In the first quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 7.7% year over year (and 17% excluding the impact of divestitures to $146.1 million. Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment, which was hard hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


Moreover, the company posted a profit on both an adjusted basis and according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted for one-time items, net income landed at $20.9 million, or $0.17 per share, up from a loss per share of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. GAAP net income was $45.2 million, or $0.36 per share, up from a loss of $18.9 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from 3D Systems' Q1 earnings call that investors should know.

1. The company's competitive advantages
From CEO Jeffrey Graves' remarks:

There are three things that inspire my confidence in our future. And I believe they should inspire yours as well. First, we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry. [...] Second, I'm convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry. [...]

Third, as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry, we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers' needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing, but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business success.

As to Graves' first point, 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge, at least among publicly traded companies. It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technology.

For a couple of points of comparison: Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS, another well-established pure-play 3D printing company, doesn't have a metal 3D printing technology. Newly public Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTEC.

His second point about having ""the brightest and most creative application engineers"" is too subjective to address.

I'll also agree with Graves' third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage, at least relative to most other players. That said, there's a caveat here. Under the prior two CEOs, the company prematurely released products that had quality issues. So, while scale does usually provide various advantages, it won't do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality. Hopefully, this issue is largely behind 3D Systems, but investors still need to keep an eye on it.

2. Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitions
From Graves' remarks:

As you can see in our numbers for Q1, we're seeing rising demand for new applications, particularly in our healthcare business. To meet this demand forecast, we're expanding our Denver, Colorado, location by roughly 50%. [...] Through this next phase of investment [...] we'll be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications, continue expanding our product offerings, and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer base.

In Q1, 3D Systems' healthcare revenue surged 39% year over year to $72.5 million. This segment accounted for 49.6% of the company's total revenue of $146.1 million. So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrial.

As Graves said on the prior quarter's call, the company's healthcare business ""brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business."" So, naturally, it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitable.

In addition, 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi, a small Philadelphia-based bioprinting company. Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce three-dimensional, functional tissues. This was a smart move and expands the company's involvement in this space, as it's been collaborating with United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR in this realm since 2017.

Graves said one key intermediate-term application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process. A longer-term goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys for transplant purposes. Regenerative medicine, as it's often called, is in its infancy, but it has humongous growth potential.

If this company doesn’t see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: “SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.”

 \#Debunked:  Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk has presented concepts for SN high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city, you would have to travel to a remote place to get on the supposed fast flight… 2 Boarding this “fast flight” requires a suit up, when you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it’s not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let’s talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could not meet its original goals, it’s now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don’t have an airport to take off from…I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems….are you noticing a pattern?….

Critique #3 - Death:  I’ve read the comments “this is a disaster waiting to happen”, “they will get canceled when thy kill somebody”….for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash VG will have legal corners covered.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away… in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

.....

NOTE: The wealthy pay 50,000+ to scale Mount Everest every year, (Everest is cold, physically demanding, and utterly dangerous) why would they not regularly pay for SPCE?

NOTE: The cost to fly to space was over a million just years ago, VG can fly you up for 250k.",nkbmpp,Virgin Galactic II.

Their report was a miss by a penny but still made close to 2 billion dollars as a company. When RKT missed the entire sector dropped drastically. The main stocks that crashed were LDI, HMPT and UWMC. I strongly believe RKT was the culprit. Famous for being short as high as 35% just a quarter ago. I believe the sharks were still nearby and ready. The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked. The difference with these companies and most stocks, especially tech/growth is they all make serious, serious money!

**LDI makes close to 1 billion a year, just made over 300 million. Announced a special dividend of 200 million or 62 cents a share. They announced a regular dividend per share. The market cap is slightly over 4 billion. Yes, they have a PE ratio of under 4! Cash flows to buy back shares instead of using money for dividends. They have lost over 1.2 billion in market cap since RKT report.**

**HMPT just made 149 million the past 3 months. They have lost over 500 million in market cap since RKT reported. They have not announced a dividend or anything yet. The company trades at 2.5x earnings. They make cash!**

**UWMC, did the right thing makes cash and announced a 300 million buyback. I believe they have smoked out the shorts as it dipped as low as 6.25 and has recovered nicely.**

**RKT makes roughly 8 billion a year! They are valued near 35 billion and have lost over 14 billion since earninings! They last quarter gave out over 2 billion for free via a special dividend of over 1.14 per share. They have 2 billion shares! They make over $4 per share and trade under 17!!!**

LDI trades 200,000 shares daily! The stock is under 14!! Can you imagine a 100 million buyback?? They are giving 100 million via dividend and just gave 200 million special dividend they can do it!

HMPT trades just over 100,000 shares at about 6! Even a 20 million buyback will moon the stock. They just made 149 million the last 3 months!

But looking for advice if should just stay the course or go for a more direct ETF?",nkcvvm,Looking for some advice on building a nest egg for the kids.
543,,2021-05-25 00:51:00,t3_nkd1hk,,stocks," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

This company is about 20% short, has 113 million in cash in the bank with just under 15 million in debt, has a market cap of 500 million. They have generated about 80 million over the past 2 quarters as well. We have a major catalyst still….people aren’t running to the gym. If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

> In a recent interview, Klaus Zellmer, Board Member responsible for Sales, Marketing and After-Sales at its passenger car division, said that if Volkswagen launches an autonomous service, it could charge vehicle owners 7 euros per hour and hit profitability. If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK’s estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.

> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW’s autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.

> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future. ARK will continue to monitor VW’s progress.

Why is ARK Invest still emphasizing autonomous driving technology?

The bull case for Tesla (TSLA) has always been much stronger on the second-life energy storage front than on the autonomous driving technology front.  Only today is Tesla reconsidering its earlier rejection of lidar technology, but that's because there has been a credible embrace of it.

Tesla has made its bet with Luminar Technologies (LAZR) because [Volkswagen has embraced lidar technology and made its bet with Argo AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/naooit/electric_vehicle_volkswagen_embraces_lidar_for/).

Nonetheless, just like with Tesla, the [bull case for the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mnxdex/oops_dd_underestimated_volkswagen_by_2025_could/), is, in my opinion, much stronger on other fronts: scale, charging networks, bidirectional charging technology, the company's own planned foray into second-life energy storage, and so on.

Scenario #1) I like to keep my dividend and REIT stocks in the Roth. Typically, I'm looking for low PE and high yield (typically over 3%, but some in the 4-6% range). Anyway, I've seen a lot of these stocks appreciate significantly. In 2021 alone, I sold positions that appreciated 29%, 15%, and 18% respectively.

* When you are researching a stock, what do you usually take a look at? Do you just do research on google and see where it takes you, or do you have a usual way of proceeding?
* Do you often go on YouTube to learn more about a stock? If you do, what do  you usually expect from a video you are watching? Is it more general information like how the business works, what the industry looks like, what are the financials? Or is it more for technical analysis with charts and everything?
* When listening to a video, what is the most crucial information you want to have to feel like the video was not a complete waste of your time?

558,,2021-05-25 11:58:38,t3_nknzhl,,stocks,"Hi, I was just wondering what are people doing who work for listed companies. Would be cool to hear experience of other people.

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that. Didn't really look into it much.

Looking forward to hearing from other people.",nknzhl,People who work for publicly listed company. Do you own shares of company you work for?

I am very good with tracking them and making sure to close out if it is unfavorable. A family emergency came about and I was unable to attend to my stocks for two days. I had 10 spy put credit spreads that went ITM at expiry and I was unable to close them out before expiration due to said emergency. A took a net loss of 1000 bucks (which in the grand scheme of things isn’t the worst case scenario but still sucks). 

Two days later, I look at my TD Ameritrade account and it exercised the short and long leg to cover. Because it exercised basically 1000 shares of spy, it shows up as $420,000 cost and $419,000 proceeds. This equals out to 1000 dollar loss. I obviously did not put up that much capital.

568,,2021-05-25 16:31:17,t3_nktves,,stocks,"So I'm quite new at this, started investing like a week before the whole GME thing (unfortunately didn't buy any though). Advice I've gotten has said to buy into the market piece by piece, slowly over time and I've been following it. When it comes to selling I've assumed I'd just sell everything I had in a stock once it went up enough but then I thought ""well what if I sell it off piece by piece"". Specifically I have a +$150 return on 22nd Century Group Inc so I sold $130 worth of it. I figure if it continues to climb sure I'll make a bit less money but if it crashes (which I don't think is likely but you never know) I'll lose less and if it dips but looks like it'll come back up I can use the money from the sale to buy more. I know that sounds like I'm trying to time the market which is foolish but this is motivated more by wanting to actually secure the money I make from my investments rather then watch the money number go up only for it to drop like a rock before I actually get any of it out. So is this a viable strategy or am I totally off the mark here?",nktves,"People say you should buy into the market piece by piece, does the same hold true for selling?"

570,,2021-05-25 16:55:55,t3_nkug7q,,stocks,"...it happens.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day since with probably a constant adjustment of the shorting of the stock going on.

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait for the suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events. This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates. My guess is that so long as they don't have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2, they are going to crush earnings.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor’s said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

**Highlights**

* [U.S. new home sales pulled back less than expected in April over March,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-fell-5-140851441.html) even as rising prices, tight inventory began to ripple through the housing market. New home sales fell by 5.9% in April over the previous month, giving back some of March's 7.4% gain, [the Commerce Department said Tuesday](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Consensus economists were looking for a drop of 7%
* The Washington DC’s Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* American Electric Power (AEP) target raised by Barclays from $95 to $105 at Overweight. Stock currently around $86.50

Now of course the entire market is just based on investor sentiment and literally anything can happen, but I think the point the person wanted to make was that there is no reason to be hyped or similar for this. 

Take earnings for example, if they are insanely good you can be hyped about it, or really good news in general. That still doesn't mean that it has to go up or anything has to change, but a positive move should be most likely (of course, depending on many factors. E.g. if it beat expectations but investors had even higher expectations and the earnings were shortcoming of that, then it will fall regardless).

When it was first announced to be discussed someone got quite upset in the thread and noted that the value of the stock isn't changed by this move. I was surprised by his anger because the comment he replied to didn't indicate that, but for some reason (and I have seen that plenty after that post) it's almost treated as if you just get free shares or other benefits by many people.

Are you trying to make a quick buck, in it for the short term, or long term investor?  

**RKT** came into focus a few months ago when it came out that it was being targeted by short-sellers ($24/sh).  The CEO took the strong arm position that he was going to go against them and the stock responded positively (due to GME being in the news then).  This was prior to earnings, and even CNBC commented on it compliments of Cramer IIRC ($28/sh)

A few days later it went back down to it's prior price point ($25/sh), and though earnings were positive, it continued to decline.  Now $16/sh.

It's basically under attack and as many saavy investors recognize, short-sellers are betting against the company for a reason.

In that business, you make money from the interest (as a lender, compliments of amortization), origination and other fees as a service provider.  

Interest rates declining incentivize people to refinance a mortgage, or to move to a new home (property tax caps be forgotten).  This means greater profits when rates are decreasing.  

Interest rates have no more room to go down, and people are going to hold on to their mortgage rates (0.5% to 0.75% difference) meaning amortization plays a role in favor of the borrower.  

Millennials have been adverse to buying homes, preferring to rent.  Builders in large cities have accommodated this trend as well.  Evictions have held off and affordable housing coming into a larger role the last few years.

Long term investors like Mr. Buffett have exited the financials market (e.g. WFB) which include lenders.  Back to that original question, what kind of investor are you?

I remember WAMU and Countrywide.  Today it's dominated by Quicken and a dozen years back it was another lender (forgot the name) and it'll be different a dozen years from now.

Anyhow, I'd avoid the entire mortgage / lender sector:

* Refinancing decreases when rates are low, or increasing
* COVID has impacted income for many people
* Evictions on hold, but now that they can be relaxed, expect people to exhibit poor credit
* Preference for renting in city-centers versus buying in the 'burbs.

But hey, that's me.  I'd love some data for someone to convince me otherwise.",,

There is a new share count coming up so updated numbers will be released in just over a week I believe.

Profile: Is this company real?

1. Website
2. Address, Google Maps of HQ
3. LinkedIn
4. Wikipedia
5. Social Media Accounts
6. News Articles
7. Key Executives

Financials:

1. Look through the latest **income, balance sheet and cash flow statements**
2. Calculate **YoY and QoQ** **growth** for at least 10 years (or less if the company is young) for each of the 3 financial statements
3. Calculate different **valuation ratios and metrics** to see how they **stack up against their competitors**
4. Look through **Analyst** Estimates, **Investment Bank** ratings and **DCF** figures

Documents:

1. Read through recent **earnings call transcripts** to get a feel for how executives communicate and how honest they have been in the past quarters.
2. **SEC Filings**: Read through proxies, prospectuses and more to get a full picture.

Insider Activity:

1. Find out how many I**nsider Buys and Sales** have been made in the past 6 months.
2. Look into who these insiders are, what they're role and functions are within the company.

Ownership:

1. Find out which **Mutual Funds, ETFs and Hedge Funds** own the stock, how much of it and when they last bought/sold shares.

Social Sentiment:

1. Scan through **Reddit, Twitter, Facebook Groups** for ticker/company mentions to see if the conversation is bullish or bearish. Beware, this can be misleading due to spam and trolling.
2. **Google Keyword Research:**  This is especially useful if the company provides a consumer product or  service, I like to find out how often its mentioned and find any spikes  in online searches.

Future:

1. What products and services are planned for the future?
2. What are the industry/sectors innovations, needs and wants?
3. What are competitors developing and are planning on releasing?
4. What markets is the company looking to penetrate?
5. What cultural/societal shifts and trends might effect the companies roadmap?

Price:

1. I look for **price dips/spikes** and then look into what was going on during that period to see **what may have effected or caused them.**

**So,  this is part of my process, some of it may suit your style, some wont.  I'd love to hear your feedback and it would be great if you all can  share your process!**",nl0qad,Due Diligence: How do I perform it?

Do they have any sort of advantage over the competition and is that advantage growing/shrinking? Will they be able to maintain the advantage for the foreseeable future? 

Maybe consider looking up the google trends to see how their popularity/searches fluctuate. Has the company and their main product been on a strong decline in the last 10 years in terms of popularity/online searches, why?

Investing in physical silver isn't a standard play on returns like most people are familiar with. It's a hedge against USD, as well as a prediction of a correction to standard ratios. 

If silver corrects to its mid 1900s ratio of 1:45 gold:silver, that's a 50% return, on top of any incremental growth from both metals. I'm fine with 15% above spot for that (which is atypical and only a result of unprecedented demand of this past year). If it corrects to its historical value against the USD, that's a significant jump in price.

Most PM ""experts"" would put realistic fair value of silver above $100. That's again assuming accurate pricing to its previous value against the dollar. A few make the case for $1000. I think that's a stretch, and more in line with the pre 1900s pegged value of 1:15 gold:silver. But even at $130, does it really matter if you paid $32 for an ounce when spot was $28? Especially if anything were to happen to devalue the dollar even more than it already is. Both the Euro and the Renminbi are gaining traction as a global reserve currency.

But really, I'm not in silver because I think it's going to be some outperforming asset. It's a hedge against hyperinflation. At 3-5% of a portfolio, I'm fine with the current prices. And it's value against gold leaves it undervalued even with premiums factored in.",,

Myself I saw a bunch of WSB posts hitting the frontpage a couple of times and I had looked into getting something like Robinhood but I'm not from the US so my efforts kind of stranded there. Then when the GameStop squeeze (or baby squeeze of whatever) happened, I said to myself: I missed out on the (post keeps getting deleted for saying pitloin) crazes, missed out on this one - I'm gonna make sure I don't miss out on the next ridiculous moneyride. So here I am, entering the market in February, doing all the DD, looking left right up down into all kinds of stocks that I still believe in and investing in a bunch. I entered with around 4k. I lost about a quarter of that. All the while I've had 2 shares of GME or something and it's hard to miss out on the DD for that.

So after a while I kept dumping more of my other stocks and trading them in for GME and AMC. I have those + some uwmc. I'm in the green again! And like you said, it's a hell of a ride, very entertaining. And personally I don't think it's that stressful. I kind of accepted that this money went to a unique experience and a possible winning lottery ticket. So whatever it's doing, it's fine by me.

Only downside I feel is that some of the apes are fanatics. Shit, you don't want to invest in something? That's fine! You do you. But apparently some idiots here have to go try ruin your mood by down voting you for doing something different than them. Apologies!",,

And, its not that I am looking for a dividend stock but more that earning a dividend would mitigate the risks with holding Ford. No question that the new electric F-150 looks very solid but there is just too much intense competition in the electric car space with companies even operating in niche areas such as trucks. I think Tesla and some of the Chinese stocks will continue to be very formidable competition for Ford and others. Additionally, companies that operate in niche areas like electric SUVs might have a better ability to specialize in them.  The other issue is that historically Ford has had some issues with quality and calling back cars. I think if that were to happen again during the rollout of these electric trucks, the Ford stock will tank which is why I would like to have a dividend to protect against all of this.

I said Amazon has significant market power ( it’s very hard or rare to have a true monopoly , so in economics we use “market power” as a proxy to describe a firm who has monopolistic features.)

Economics, for the most part, only covers anticompetitive component of antitrust. Large firms like Amazon are demonstrating that when I firm is significantly large they can impact things like local and state tax structures and incentives. They are automatically given a seat at the table when it comes to larger political decisions. Instead of “we the people” it’s “Amazon. And the other people”.

Tesla has been unable to keep their lead in both technology, car quality or marketshare.

I used to love Target. I shopped there for most everything just to support them. I'm finding I'm spending A LOT less at Target the last 1.5 years.",,

Next day they blocked buying.  When they lifted it I DCA on the way down.  Finally got out of robinhood and tranfered my shares to Fidelity.  Saw others did the same with robinhood falsifying purchase prices messing with peoples cost basis.  Luckily didn't happen to me they got it right.  After saving for a while put $3k in and spent half on AMC at $9.80.  Immediately dipped down to $8.  Never sold any shares GME or AMC.  Now I am way up.  Wanted to buy in again on GME at $150 but by the time I got the funds I wanted it was at $155.  Got greedy and said I would wait for drop to buy in.  It never dropped.  Said earlier today I would buy in for $200 or less on Monday after my big payday Friday.  Then it jumped way over.  Next week I'm just gonna buy whatever I can and hope for the best.,,

It’s been amazing to have during COVID obviously, but I’ll explain why I bought before lockdown.

•	In the winter where I live, it’s dark and probably raining (Seattle) by 5 PM so I’m not going to be working out outside for half the year, at least.
•	Going to a gym involves bringing clothes and gear to work with me and then adding at least some extra commute time to get to the gym before or after work, which I don’t need more of.  Said another way, if I want to get a half hour workout in at a gym then it will require a lot more time than a half hour to actually make it happen.  I’m busy and would rather wake up, bang out 30-45 minutes on the bike, and continue getting ready for work.
•	My company and many others in the area offer fitness subsidies to employees.  I get a $500 fitness subsidy per year but have to spend $1,000 for them to reimburse the $500.  With Peloton’s zero down, zero interest payment plan I can spread the cost over multiple years and my company will end up having paid for a significant portion of the bike.  Hard to spend $1,000 per year on fitness otherwise, unless you want to pay for classes that require commuting to.
•	I get a way better workout with an instructor than I would if I was just spinning on a stationary bike.

I’m sure my reasons don’t apply for everyone’s situations, but I will absolutely be using my Peloton for a long time.  All that said, the stock is overvalued lol",,

RH will charge you a flat fee of $75 to transfer. if your account value is greater than $25,000, fidelity will waive this fee if you reach out to customer support. otherwise, it will show as a negative $75 cash balance until you make a deposit into your fidelity account (then they’ll subtract $75 from the deposit.)

And when those exploded and I bought more GME options. By end of January, I had 1.2M.

998,gzg77io,2021-05-25 23:13:00,t1_gzg77io,t3_nkx8pc,stocks,"I was following GME since about September and started taking out options in October when it was around nine bucks I rolled most of those out until switching to stocks in December the day it jumped to 40$. Ended up selling half at 350 and half at 400. Kept one stock just to be a part of the ride. Then I took out what I planned on being a long position when it dipped down to 50$ but ended up selling those at 280. I sold all but 2 stocks so I can still be a part of it but I won't be joining in again in a big way, I'm sure I must have used up all my good luck on timing two dips perfectly.",,
