14,,2021-05-20 01:49:50,t3_ngnide,,investing,"New Investor - Everything I've read says to buy a mutual fund with low expense ratios as the fees add up and you compound more money with lower fees. 

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

&#x200B;

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):** 

\-Expense ratio 0.015%, 1yr +45.97%, 5yr +23.41%, 10yr +14.16%

**Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)**

\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%

&#x200B;

In this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio. I do know I'm not accounting for risk here but, being youngish, I am not too worried about it at this point. I also understand the 1 year growth is a bad marker of growth due to the COVID.

Along those same lines, what factors would cause a funds to close to new investors when there is still strong interest to investing with them?

Over the past 10+ years, interest rates have been at all-time low. This disproportionately helps tech growth and high-debt companies (note the overlap there). As interest rates (almost inevitably) rise, these stocks are not expected to perform as well. 

Like you said, tech/IT is more volatile. In a market decline, especially a sustained one, tech companies will struggle more than the broad economy. 

These are really the only two things that “refute” your thinking that I could think of. With that being said, I’m on your said. I too am young and have a long time horizon, so I am (partly) in etfs with significant expense ratios and with significant volatility. Just make sure you understand the risks.

inflation assumes that the value of the dollar has declined permanently respect to stock valuations denominated in that unit of account (think of it as the dollar hyper inflating with respect to bitcon/stock/gold/etc.).  Fundamentally, inflation is not being calculated into previously established indexes.

reversion is a little more complicated, but basically it involves the unit of account being more important than common stock as a store of value.  Fundamentally, just like the the Phillips Curve has been broken post QE (which is a never before tried central bank experiment), the various indexes of how things *have worked in the past* will no longer apply (and thus an extended reversion required to correct the index will not happen).",,

That fatest tail increase period in inflation matched the fatest tail upside in gold. Now there is not enough data to go further but if you are worried about dramatic US inflation I'm sure gold will do ok.

Kind of like puts. Are far OTM puts really a hedge? They are more correlated but if SP500 goes down just a bit then they won't pay off (because you hold for a far tail event).

Maybe I should say this: gold correlation with inflation isn't great but is a great tail hedge (based on 1 data point lol 1970-1980). So if you care about tail hedges the most (more extreme inflation) then gold is a good hedge. 

I think 1980-1990 is hard to say. I think when the hedge paid off so much, it was overbought and then you have periods of underperformance.

Also note that in 1970-1980 CPI was accelerating (which means you have more worries about it going out of control) and 1980-1990 it was decelerating CPI (so although high inflation rate it was going down). So difference is 1970-1980 worries were out of control inflation where as 1980-1990 inflation seems to be ok now so let's get these fat bond yields.

&#x200B;

So I agree that correlation isn't great, but a fat tailed version of correlation (which you would probably want out of a tail hedge) could be good. Also this makes sense from first principles that for a fat tailed inflation event gold would be great because everyone would be freaking out. Would also be interesting to look at acceleration of CPI vs gold returns.

So I think gold is a hedge against inflation but more like a put option is to equities rather than a short position where there will be a perfect negative correlation.",,

2. Prioritize paying off the loans.

You can kind of look at paying off those loans as making an investment with a guaranteed 12.5% return with 0 risk. (Not exactly how the math works, but close enough). US stock market has done about 10% on average, and there's a fair amount of risk - so paying off your loans is really good.

3. After that, I'd just save up for the car down payment, and pay off the loan on the typical schedule. Most auto loan rates are pretty low - so there's not a great reason to pay those off early.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back.

([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

E.g.  an S&P 500 fund with a 0.015% ER should slightly outperform an S&P 500 fund with a 0.04% ER.

In practice, that may not always be the case with index funds because of tracking error.

Also, in reality, I'd argue that there's not going to be a whole lot of long-term difference between same/similar mutual funds where the ER is under 0.25%, and especially if they have ERs under 0.10%. Maybe some minimal difference in net of fees return, but nothing that will really make or break you even compounding over decades.

I wouldn't say you're necessarily missing anything, per se. There will always be mutual funds with high(er) ERs that outperform funds with low(er) ERs. Whether they can maintain that outperformance over long stretches of time (e.g. 20-30+ years) is the key question, and obviously not answerable without hindsight.

But, I would say that with the two you're using in your comparison, they're not really comparable. You're comparing a fund that holds 500 of the largest companies across all industries and sectors to a fund that has 70 holdings focused in technology, which has had a strong run over the last several years. So, it's not an apples to apples in this case.

TL/DR: funds with lower expenses will tend to outperform same/similar funds with higher expenses over time. Over certain periods of time, there will inevitably be funds with high(er) expenses that outperform funds with low(er) expenses.",,

Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

As in, I expect the USD to inflate 2% each year, devaluing the currency and decreasing my purchasing power, so if I put it into BTC that is (disregarding the volatility) increasing in value each year, \*increasing\* your purchasing power than it is deflationary. You could store your money in it to hedge against the inflation over time of a trusted currency. 

&#x200B;

While transferring cash from one currency to another during crisis levels of inflation such as in Venezuela is somewhat hedging for inflation it's not exactly what they're talking about when using those terms. At least that's what I'm assuming they're talking about.

&#x200B;

What the thread is arguing though is that even though bitcoin has a wild 1, 3, 5, and 10 year yield, this is not hedging for inflation, its actually just a bubble forming around an asset that has no underlying value and the bubble will burst, unlike say the price of gold which... doesn't seem to ever fall out of favor. It will rise and fall over time depending on the markets but it won't burst. Not sure I entirely agree with that tbh. Not sure I disagree with it.

* bitcoin has finite supply and that's the main reason it was called assets that protect against inflation. The reason for its price volatility is because currently it's used more as speculation and not massively used as currency on daily lives . When it can be used as proper currency (where a lot of shop globally accept it as payment) then it will be a true assets that protect against inflation. Even gold value had go down massively and anyone doesn't argue that it's an asset to protect against inflation, the difference is bitcoin is way easier to trade and not manipulated by bank that's why it has more fluctuation.
* bitcoin is long term investment, because currently its use is immature. However many countries especially one with hyperinflation made the people turn to bitcoin/cryptocurrency. US Dollar will also go down the same route because it has repeated many times in history that the kind of current policy that the FED currently takes will hurt in the long run and accelerate inflation. US Dollar will not be getting killed by other traditional currency but it will be killed by commodities price, assets price, and some solid and massively used cryptocurrency which is translate as inflation. And as history goes the devaluation of US Dollar buying power is true  and continue to happen in the last few decades especially if we compare it with assets like housing, more so if we compare it with bitcoin in the last 10 year.
* As far as I know, the inflation shows mainly in commodities because the demand still large and the supply chain has problem. As for money printing is going to stock market (even I predict the stimulus go to stock or meme coin because of young investor without proper research). For the daily lives necessity demand doesn't go up much (in my country it seems to go down), but somehow the money velocity massively down which supposed to mean less transaction in actual market. If we believe the data then when economy rebound, the daily lives necessity product demand will rise and the price will also rise, since supply chain problem will not be easily fixed while too much money flow to the market. 
* My current opinion of US market is the FED trying to pump economy but avoid inflation by mainly pump money on the stock. This way the money got mainly into the rich and not the real market (the reason of growing inequality), it will not show real inflation effect immediately especially since the rich tend to hold their investment and buy more investment than spend in real market. This is also the reason for assets bubble especially the tech sector since their valuation are not backed by hard assets but by revenue growth. When the money flow to real market and the tech sector cannot justify their valuation with their revenue, this could made the bubble burst.
* Anyway, I only invest few buck on crypto and doesn't really like bitcoin since for me its use case as currency has failed because with high price the transaction fee is high too. So even if it has high probability to go higher (since it's the grandfather of crypto), I will not invest on it.",,

If you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey, you'd be met by how much money they've  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade; and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions. Conventional and generic as it may sound, trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork.  
With so, throughout my experience and journey in the forex market, here is my checklist before I enter a trade.

  
**1. KNOW YOUR BROKER.**  Yes, you've read that right. Knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate. You have to know how much spread and leverage they offer--given so, it will help you determine whether your type of trading (Scalping, Swing, or Day Trading) would suit their services. For this, I use Fazzaco.com. They provide in-depth analyses on different FX Brokers. From trust ratings to news and economic datas , they have it all.  
**2. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TRADES.** Jot down your performance. Treat trading like a competitive online game. As much as possible, you would want to be one of the bests--having high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals. To do that, you must be self-aware of your trading history. Trading is more than just making money. Part of it is also keeping records. I highly suggest using myforexbook for currency traders  
**3. CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS.** Technical Analysis is one thing--personally, I use TA to find the best position to enter a trade. But other than that, my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer. Again, NEVER NEGLECT YOUR FUNDAMENTALS.  
**4. TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS.** One of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade. Although some harbor success  on these methods, it isn't exactly for everyone. Stick to your plan. Remember, there are only two outcomes in trading. Either you win, or you lose. There is no middle ground.  
**5. HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.** Think long-term. If you want to find success in the career of trading, set ideal objectives. It is essential to have daily, weekly, and monthly goals.  
Always remember that rules are what distinguishes viability from seasonality. A good trader is built step after step.  Hope you guys find this post useful.",,

* 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model: suitable for companies that do not necessarily grow at a constant rate over time. They tend to be high-growth initially, and become stable after a couple of years.
* Dividend Discount Model (DDM): accurate for companies that consistently pays out a meaningful portion of their earnings as dividends.
* Excess Returns Model: used for financial companies such as banks and insurance, generally do not have a significant proportion of physical assets, and face different regulatory requirements for cash holdings.
* Adjusted-Funds-From-Operations (AFFO) 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model: used for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as they incur capital gains and other real estate-specific factors which impacts their free cash flows.",,

Initially crypto kind of got it's initial momentum from two crowds.  One was tech enthusiasts who throught it was cool and liked being able to mine it on their home computer early on.  The other big one was the anti-bank crowd that was way more prominent after 2008, that's kind of evolved into the whole DeFi movement where it's not so much a matter of hard currency as it is having some kind of financial system independent of traditional intermediaries like banks.

Still you didn't have many comparisons to gold, the whole idea was still to actually replace dollars and banks for the longest time.

What really got the whole argument about it being a gold analogue or inflation  protection kicked off in the last few years when it become increasingly clear that the energy consumption and efficiency of proof of work coins was awful from an environmental standpoint and that the overall volatility and lack of supporting infrastructure really made using it as an actual currency impractical.  Suddenly everyone needed some other environmentally terrible business to compare it against.  That's where gold came in.  Gold extract is terrible and energy intensive too so crypto mining could compare favorably.  Commodities are also more volatile so that was less of a problem.  

It's basically all marketing and always has been.  In general crypto has also shifted heavily from a batch of true believers to people looking for a low effort way to get rich quick.  There's no real philisophical underpinning to a lot of it anymore and the lack of regulation has made it a breeding ground for money laundering, scams and over manipulation.

Stock futures are pointing to a lower open again. As of 0620 the Nasdaq, Dow, S&P all down about 0.5%. If you’re keeping score, this sets us up for a fourth straight day of losses

The dramatic sell-off in cryptos appears to be the main driving force behind all of this. My thoughts on this in the audio, don’t feel like typing them.

Difficult to see right now where a catalyst will come from for a reversal. We do have initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations there is for about 450k new claims, slightly lower than the 473k we had last week, which was a post-pandemic low. If the number comes in well below forecasts it could help sentiment.

currently being investigated by NYAG and in the process:

- Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)

- Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.

- Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.

- Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)

- Finding the last bank on earth, Deltec Bank from Bahamas willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to willingly deals with drug cartels. No bank wants tether as a client.

- Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

I think in terms of the above, I think you've had a decade+ where growth (and tech in particular) was the primary discussion, the only game in town, etc etc.  I'm a little concerned that perhaps that era of easy growth investing is over and last year's insane performance of aggressive growth was perhaps sort of a ""grand finale.""

That's not saying no growth, that's not saying no tech. It's just that the portfolio that people often have posted on here over the last half decade that basically resembles a tech fund or aggressive growth fund hasn't worked this year and may be bumpier going forward for a while.

Personally, I'd say have a very diversified portfolio (and perhaps that's index + some minor active or other variation) and if you are going to have an actively managed growth fund I'd suggest consideration of a more broadly diversified one, such as Baron Global Advantage (BGAFX, which is a very good, broad global aggressive growth fund) or others - but an aggressive growth fund like that would be a reasonable % of the portfolio.",,

**Keypath IPO is another Macquarie (Australian Investment Bank) listing and is only to being listed as a path for the private equity owners and key staff to cash out their shares. The IPO values the company at around USD800million yet shows no path to ever achieving profitability.  Beware.**

Keypath IPO

Keypath Education is a US based education business that is soon to IPO in  Australia - not sure why they don't do it in the USA...

Keypath Education has been building its business since 2014 (7 years) and is  yet to turn a profit. Each year Keypath Education adds additional  programs (Masters) to drive additional student enrollments and revenue.  Additions of programs requires investment in learning design. The more  Keypath Education invests in learning design the greater its future  growth will be as this means new programs are being developed or  existing programs are being refreshed.

High overheads

Old  programs grow stale and over time drive lower revenue, so ever  increasing investment in programs is required to drive revenue growth  year on year.

The second part of  Keypath Education driving revenue growth is through marketing. Keypath  Education primarily drives student enrollments via online marketing  primarily Google and Facebook, but also a range of online sources.  Keypath Education is operating in a highly competitive market which  results in high marketing costs as a proportion of revenue. Higher  marketing spend drives higher enrollments which drives revenue. If  marketing spend is reduced enrollments reduce.

**Covid black swan to the rescue**

The  covid pandemic was a black swan event which saw a large portion of its  largest market (Australia) in lockdown for a good part of half a year  which the government paying people to not work and doubling welfare  payments to unemployed. This saw a large spike in enrollments over 2020  and 2021 as people turned to study to improve chances of re-entering the  workforce or to upskill while they were under lockdown.

Keypath’s  financial statements for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 Statement of  Cash Flows shows increasing investment in its program offering  (Additions of amortizable assets), with investments increasing 50% over  the three years. Meanwhile existing programs also see increasing  depreciation as the investment in those programs depreciates in value.

However  the financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2020 shows  something interesting. While revenues have increased substantially  (70%) marketing spend only increased 42%. This means the marketing spend  over the 6 months ended Dec 2020 was much more ""effective"" than that in  the six months ended Dec 2019. Additionally salaries and wages, which  reflect investment in people to generate sales and retain existing  students only grew 43% - in line with marketing.

What  this means is that Keypath Educations recent jump in revenue is not  sustainable and was only due to the Covid pandemic as people were left  with little to do but study.

What  this means is Keypath Education saw a windfall gain in enrollments due  to Covid without a resulting higher investment in either marketing or  staff to enroll those students. Keypath Education was converting  marketing spend at a rate far higher than in previous periods. This is  an abnormal situation and is unlikely to continue as people return to  work and life returns to normal.

**Diminishing investment in the business**

Further  Keypath Education's additions to amortizable intangible assets was  lower in the Dec 2020 half than in prior periods. This means Keypath  Education invested less in its business. As new courses see diminishing  enrollments as they mature this under investment in building and  maintaining courses will show itself over the coming years. If Keypath  Education isn’t building and maintaining its existing programs at ever  higher rates its revenue will eventually plateau then decline.

Keypath's  main revenue drivers is number of new students and its ability to  retain existing students. However if you read the offer documents both  of these drivers are completely absent, instead is hundreds of pages of  fluff about minimal investment in technology to market itself as a  ""tech"" business. It's nothing more than a sales and marketing arm of  universities. Definitely not a true tech business. The rest of the offer  document is fluff about diversity and how Keypath Education isn't just  like every other Online Program Management business in a very crowded  market.

What Keypath’s IPO  represents is a private equity firm that is desperate to exit a loss  making business that cannot turn a profit. The Covid epidemic saw a  windfall temporary increase in enrollments, which combined with reduced  investment in its product and reduced marketing and staff spend gives  the impression of a business about to turn a profit. This could not be  further from the truth.

**Recent jump in revenue not sustainable**

As  life returns to normal, the unemployment rates in Australia and the USA  are driven below 5% and 4% online education will become less appealing  and driving new enrollments will become much more competitive, requiring  substantially more investment in refreshing programs and higher  marketing and staff spend to convert leads to enrolments and retain them  in study.

Further Keypath  Education's Dec 2020 results are inflated by gains on currency  revaluation and movements in the AUD to the USD over the 6 months, this  adds approximately 1.5m to its bottom line, which in future periods  won't be recurring.

In their  attached financial statements Note 6 Amortization of intangibles (2020,  2019 and 2018 years). This note reflects that the amortization expense  on intangibles (namely, its course development) is forecast to decrease  substantially from 2021 through to 2025. If no future investment is made  this points to a downward investment in the future of the business in  order to drive short-term profitability and the share price at the  expense of the long-term growth of the business.

**Keypath Australia is running out of growth**

Keypath  Education has drawn a large portion of its growth from being one of the  first movers into the Australian market with which Keypath Education  found little competition. This allowed Keypath Education to add from  FY15 to FY18 three partners, then another three in FY 19. However this  slowed to two new partners and FY20 and in FY21 only one partner was  added. There is diminishing opportunities for Keypath to growth in  Australia with much of the low hanging fruit in terms of partners and  programs already developed.

**Future of exiting programs**

Page  70 of the prospectus illustrates the expiry of Keypath Education's  contracts. A full 74% of contracts will expire over the next six years.  Over this time university partners, boosted by Covid pushing their  programs online are going to find ways to reduce costs and learn how to  deliver successful online programs themselves.

There  is no guarantee these contracts once they expire will roll forward to  longer contracts and if they do, the universities are likely to demand  better terms once the industry is at maturity than they did in the  growth phase for OPM over the last six years. This is a major risk for  Keypath, as just as it is moving towards smaller losses it might find  its revenue streams dry up, with increased competition and lower margins  offered by its existing partners.

**Keypath in Canada and UK**

Keypath  Education's business in the UK and Canada has been a failure. Keypath  found the Canadian and UK markets not conductive to the type of rapid  growth a private equity business seeks in new markets. This has resulted  in little revenue growth in these markets and little prospect for  future growth.

**KeypathEdge fake ""eductech""**

Keypath  Education markets itself as an “edutech” business to boost its tech  credentials. However the fact is Keypath has little sophisticated  technology, much of its platforms are based on Microsoft platforms or  other purchased software used for course development. Keypath is not a  ‘tech’ business, it is more accurately described as a marketing and  sales business which is where the vast majority of its expenditure sits.  This is why it has high operating costs but relatively small  investments in technology.

**Another Macquarie Bank Pump and Dump**

Keypath  Education is highly over valued based on its proposed offer price. This  will be a float like Macquarie Bank's other recent famous IPO Nuix  which was tainted by inflated numbers, fraud and has tanked and will be  very unlikely to return to its IPO 'valuation'.

Keypath  has no path to profit, requires massive investment just to keep pumping  out new courses and due to the intense competition in the industry must  spend a massive proportion of its revenues on marketing and staff to  keep students from dropping out after finding the online learning  experience less than satisfactory.

Im hoping this is the correct area to post this, but im trying to determine why would people touch their equity to buy another home when you have also have to pay that equity back during a long term investment?  


Reason I ask is, I am trying to see how this is even a benefit when usually equity plus the new mortgage price is still higher than the average price around town. I can understand 20% of your own money because you dont pay that back and it sits as an investment in a home, but equity, I am having a hard time seeing how this even clears rent + equity return. 

&#x200B;

example, im looking into cape coral (would like to be a future investment when I retire) with 20% down its about 900 a month but to rent it out in that area specifically is about 1400. so with equity and mortgage, its about that price and possibly more.

Why? Miners (or rather, the computers that make up the network pool) are free to leave the network. While incredibly unlikely, it is theoretically possible to wake up tomorrow and find that all existing miners have freely decided to leave the mining pools. If that happens, not only does it become very difficult to execute transactions, the entire network becomes vulnerable to devaluation or illegitimate coins in the form of a 51% attack. 

Now imagine a smaller, less extreme version of this scenario happening over a longer period of time. If other cryptocurrencies (or other uses for compute power in general) become more lucrative to mine, people will transfer their compute resources there.

But tbh what's the chances this happens we have an election in 2 years and then another presidential election 2 years after that.. Interest rates are still crazy low and the economy is for the most part still shut down.. Do you think any government would want to send us into hyperinflation and what's the chances they could before we toss em out of power.

If you have been investing for a while this is exciting times.. I'm in the inflation 3-6% is going to be short term maybe till September, then it should settle down to around 2... You basically have had the whole world running on 30% for the past year.. The surge in supply thaf is going to be needed to crank the world engine upto 100% is going to be insane..",,

When people talk about hedges against inflation, they’re usually longer term. You want a hedge against inflation that’s long term, and a tool for capital flight is inherently only held in the short term (not hiding capital, fleeing with it). 

So while you can agree that in this particular instance it will beat inflation (the same way that a brick or a frozen potato can be used to hammer a nail) it’s not necessarily a good tool for that purpose.

893,,2021-05-10 13:22:19,t3_n94bfc,,investing,"Before we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

In a report titled “The investment rationale for cryptocurrencies”, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII) said it views digital assets as an alternative investment for qualified investors through a professionally managed fund.

""WFII believes that cryptocurrencies have gained stability and viability as assets, but the risks lead us to favor investment exposure only for qualified investors, and even then through professionally managed funds,"" it said. (bit.ly/33Xu07i)

Goldman Sachs Group Inc moved to allow Wall Street investors to trade with a derivative tied to bitcoin prices, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.

Bitcoin has been gaining mainstream acceptance in recent months. Morgan Stanley in March became the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, according to a CNBC report.

JPMorgan Chase & Co is also preparing to let certain clients invest in an actively managed bitcoin fund for the first time, CoinDesk reported in April. (bit.ly/3v1cyKJ)

Bank of NY Mellon Corp in February formed a new unit to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets.

Bitcoin and ethereum posted their largest one-day percentage drop since March last year on Wednesday, after China banned financial and payment institutions from providing cryptocurrency services.

There's already an algorithm developed to crack Bitcoin encryption and it's just a matter of time when the QComputers get around to 4000 Qbits to break encryption. Sure, Bitcoin can always transition to a new protocol and the users will actively need to swap coins but what happens to the lost wallets? This inherently breaks the trust in the system and leads to collapse.

An argument against this is ""You need to worry about other systems, banks, etc. when QComputers go mainstream because Bitcoin is the last of your worries."" 

Answer: Centralized systems can easily move to Quantum encryption using centralized QComputers but it takes time for Decentralized systems to move to these systems. There's a reason why some financial companies are already working on implementing/researching QComputers.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement & Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President & CEO of DDC.",nh1ol9,Drone Delivery Canada selected by UBC for remote communities delivery initiative

Also be careful as to what you are comparing. Sometimes funds will show growth excluding management fees, which makes a huge difference.

We could say the same about oxygen and cockroaches. 


> bitcoin has a hard fixed supply

No it doesn't, bitcoin currently promises to have a limit on the supply but that is up to what the miners want to do. The only Guarentee that bitcoin offers is that the majority (or super majority) of miners will dictate how the protocol works.


> Bitcoin is still early in discovery. Gold has a long history of use

I think what you mean is ""After 12 years we haven't come up with any good use cases to justify the valuation"". Bitcoin isn't in early discovery, we know exactly what bitcoin does and the truth is it's just worse than existing products except in a very few edge cases that most people don't care about.

> Are people literally saying Bitcoin is like Gold because it's an element with intrinsic properties that never change? No of course not!

You're right, you are saying bitcoin is like Gold just as much as it's like shit, all three things are completely independent of any government backing. So why do you use gold? seems pretty misleading doesn't it? Why don't we compare bitcoin to feces?

> Just in the same way comparing Bitcoin to TikTok and social media is equally as easy to pick apart with strawman arguments.

Well no, see bitcoin is a piece of software that operates over the internet and we should compare it to other pieces of software. 





So just to sum up your argument: **Bitcoin is independent of any government backing, which makes it similar to things like gold, oil, oxygen, cockroaches and shit, but let's focus on gold because that's a better sell**",,

I turned 24 earlier in the year, I currently am a chemical engineer making 108k, with a total compensation of \~125k. I have the possibility to get a new job soon making about 5k higher but with a higher TC of 145k (higher 401k match, pension etc). I live in Houston, TX.

I graduated broke but I have been saving and investing since i started working and my NW is \~108k (60% in stocks and 40% in cash). The only stock i buy is the target date fund and the Sp 500. I bought some dogecoin but lost a lot of money smh. How can I speed the wealth building process up, with a better return than the sp500 that is not risky?

I'll be more blunt; if this concept meets your standard for excellence (and it must in order for you to call it an excellent concept) then I question your judgement.

It's complicated, but you can read about it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/hc3uto/ethe_gbtc_grayscale_frequently_asked_questions/). Currently there's no etfs for crypto in the US.  It's not perfect, but it's decent enough and doesn't carry the huge premium that it once did (many people's complaints in the past).

If you're asking why crypto, I'd argue that Ethereum and DeFi ecosystem are going to be huge, and with the adoption coming and changes to the protocol it's easily the most obvious value investment in our lifetimes. There's lot of things I can send to you, but I think the St Louis Fed article is the easiest to digest and probably holds the most weight: https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets
