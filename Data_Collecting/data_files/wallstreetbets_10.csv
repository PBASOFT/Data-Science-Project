Good. 

Yes, Kashrut = Kosher. 

Kashrut is the law, Kosher is the adjective... Just like ""Halal"" means ""permissible"", not the law itself.

That said,

Now you either follow Kasruth Law to the last word, or you're wasting time practicing ""Partial"" Halal becos you'd get no credit for ""half-hearted"" practice. Its like you can't called yourself a Muslim if you only partially believe in Allah and his private messenger.

Nobody can say for certainty that these hedge funds follow different rules etc as we all see with our own eyes theres something going on. I dont even want to talk about these ghost shares that are real or not, that info will reveal itself when the share recount happens and even then thats if management wants to release those numbers. My bet they will release those numbers because its in there best interest to do so. Look at it like this why have a share recount? Why take off 500 million share dilution? Why release 43 million shares in market at market value in such a way that didnt affect price? Adam aron isnt a dumb ceo and he is all about making money for amc no matter what it takes, he see exactly what us retail traders see a very good possibility amc stock shoots way past $20.

They don't give a fuck which textbook terms you want to throw around to try to sound smart. Taxes, wages, regulation, expected policy changes, etc. all go hand in hand when it comes to profit. 

Now let me EDUCATE you on how the real world works. In 2019 the corporate tax rate was 21% in the US and 30% in Mexico. The minimum wage was $7.25 in the US and about half of that (on average) in Mexico. Mexico also has far less restrictive labor and environmental regulations than in the US. Now in 2019, Ford announced a plan to invest $900 million to expand operations in Ohio by 2023. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when Ford announces that it will no longer be expanding operations in Ohio, but will now be spending over $1 billion to build a new plant in Mexico. Just what exactly has changed? The labor costs haven't changed in either country. Could it be the expectation that the Biden Administration is going to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% at a minimum and possibly as high as 35% (which is what half the democratic party wants)?

Who gives a fuck if taxes are considered an ""input cost"" or not? Taxes are a cost PERIOD.

If you do not understand this, you do not understand simple math, general business, or basic economics. This is not a point of debate, it's 100% true and you're simply wrong.

Now I recommend you finish reading that neat little economics book you're quoting out of before trying to post anything else.

Now go take another nap Bernie.",,

However, functionally it would not impart much aside from appeals if there is even an appeal process. Most posts are deleted automatically by bots for not meeting various criteria (I'm not a mod clearly so I don't know any of them). Then there are ones deleted manually after ""breaking rules"" and then those that get deleted for being reported as breaking rules. 

A summary of the biggest issues are as follows: Most posts are deleted by bots. Most posters are shitheads that never took the time to read the rules in the first place. And updating the rules has little impact on those. Anyone who has a post deleted is going to take issue with it and complain. There are 10 million shitheads. Hence the bots. 

If you're like me, you probably read the rules as you are posting. If you aren't like me you'll read the rules once and wouldn't notice a rule change.

Admittedly I made a lot of assumptions here, and I sympathize with you because you are one of few seemingly respectable people in this sub. Updates to the rules is a good policy, but I dont think it would honestly change much.",,

The CEO just got in front at the end and people are praising him for doing the only smart thing. AMC will forever be indebted to the people holding the stock and I hope they keep that in mind going forward. AMC wouldn't exist without the holders this spring.

I am taking numbers from MarketWatch:

Over the last 3 years (2017/18/19) the company costs about $4b each year to run (COGS). So, from the start, that is the bare minimum they need to handle each year. During those years they have been clearing over $5b which is good but they only made money once.

Now, what is very relevant (and might have changed) is that as of 2020 they have 616m in short term debt. They also have almost $800m in other liabilities. That puts them at 1.93b in total current liabilities. Next, their long term debt is almost $10b. When you look at the balance sheet they have $12b in total liabilities BEFORE COVID.

With all of these numbers, I am not certain what they have done recently. I have heard they refi'ed some stuff and put some of the recently raised money towards debt. But, I couldn't find anything to see what they have done. If it was a clear cut win I would think there would be some PR from AMC setting out how they are going to handle the debt.

I am not in AMC any more and I do wish you all the luck. I would like to see this turn into a blow up of the hedge funds and their lackeys in the SEC.",,

1102,,2021-05-18 01:34:15,t3_nexq9s,,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

Edit 2: Not Financial Advice (i thought that was a given)

Edit 3: It's back testing so far - really common in Technical Analysis. Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction. Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout (when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out) - which happens.

Edit 4: Backtested - and bouncing so far.

Really important to reclaim 174.26 on the hourly close. You can see we bounced off this zone from 168.07 - 167.55 - that's key demand or support.
 
https://ibb.co/XS1t1dL

Edit 5: Reclaimed 174.26 - back tested that as well. Key levels are normally retraced as we move. Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support.
Now, 174.26 must hold as support - and we are looking pretty good.

https://ibb.co/fCrq0Fb

Edit 6: Bull flagging now into lunch time, New support put up at 176.48. Constructive.

https://ibb.co/3WTR25r

Edit 7: Great breakout from that flag. New support put up at 181.50. Still need the 1:45 close for confirmation. Look at the volume on that candle - shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives.

https://ibb.co/cFHv6W6

Edit 8: Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open - quit trading, you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl.

Self proclaimed geniuses saying ""TA Doesn't Work On GME, Ban"" - it's not that TA doesn't work on GME: 
The issue is - all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before. I don't blame you for feeling that way though - so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading. 

Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it, doesn't mean you should dismiss it.

The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly - insane how sentiment shifted. You guys are getting played like a fiddle. The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat.

Lastly I, appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn. DMs are open.

Edit 9: 189.00 is the next resistance coming up - careful there. Like I said, 181.50 is the new support to hold. Still on track for my price targets. Volume is in all the right spots.

Edit 10: Backtested & we are moving again. Support is actually a zone from 182.51 - 181.50. Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two. Remember some resistance at 189.00 - might flag there the rest of the day.

https://ibb.co/hyj7mrf

Edit 11 [3:13 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume. Still bullish consolidation below this key 189.00 resistance. Above there, straight to 200+. Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour. I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near-term trend.

https://ibb.co/R634KNj

Edit 12 [3:46 P.M. 5/18/2021]: They got the close just below the uptrend. Not a great sign - but only a 15m trend so not too damning. 
We need to hold 182.51 - 181.50. They are going to try and test that now. Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up.
Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging. Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down.

https://ibb.co/VpDJQr0

Edit 12 [4:01 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Not an awful close - but definitely not a great one. Shorts fought hard end of day - the fuckers. They know if we break 189 they are done for. Important thing though - breakout is still intact. Also - broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help.

Tomorrow - will be looking for 173.02 and 167.57 to hold - and looking for 182.54 to break (as well as 189.00).

https://ibb.co/5YcfNmG

Hope regardless of the end result you guys can pull some knowledge from this. Appreciate all the awards. Keep in mind this is a swing trade so could take a couple weeks to play out. Will probably move quicker since it‚Äôs GME.

Edit 13 [9:35 A.M. 5/19/2021]: Again getting dragged by the broader market. Major indexes opened -2%. Still - holding up relatively well honestly. Basically - between 182.54 - 167.57 is CHOP. It's when we break one of those that we can see the next move play out. Remember I said this is a swing - on these kinds of trades I just focus on the daily chart (and sometimes the hourly for monitoring the health of the trends).

Major point is -
- Above 167.57 (and that teal line) the breakout is still intact

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

What does this mean? It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking. Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU‚Äôs revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I‚Äôm very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm here with another DD, but this time it‚Äôll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I‚Äôve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DD

Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,UWMC has a business model that should weather the storm much better.

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance.

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything.

&#x200B;

Anyways, unfortunately, we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week, but we should still be BULLISH in CLOV even after all this manipulation. May 21 calls had high volume, but MM's want to make their money, and they will never allow for a run.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

I'll explain more in the commentary below.

So, before I begin, I just want to state that I respect the work you guys put into moderating this sub. At 10.1 million degenerates, that's a lot of work. With that said, I have concerns regarding your ruleset. Namely that when multiple posts get removed, people aren't actually aware of the reason for it. Posts that otherwise meet the criteria to be posted, are otherwise removed. The reasoning, i suspect, is because your ruleset is extremely vague and leaves a lot of discretion. Clarifying, and expanding, your ruleset would likely fix this, and I have some suggestions.

First, while you are under no legal obligation to moderate the content of this sub board under section 230, I appreciate you are assuming a duty of care to your community to ensure that they are somewhat protected. With that said, your ruleset and your content guidelines could stand to be strengthened. In point of fact, you are removing content that objectively meets your content guidelines. 

Case in point is that I made an update to my YOLO, nearly a month after my last YOLO, and that was because i had very significantly added to my position since then. However, Memetron removed the post, and was kind enough to tell me that YOLO updates were not allowed now even though DFV had been doing them. I told him that i wasn't aware there had been a rule change since then, and apologized. However, under your content guidelines  [linkflair - wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/linkflair#wiki_yolo) , there is no rule restricting what I did and I actually met the YOLO content guideline to appropriately post a YOLO. Nevertheless, I'm not actually mad about it.

What i am a little annoyed by is that my post regarding the shorting in the pre-market of UWMC was removed, even though i provided a factual basis for everything there. Shorters borrowed 145,000 shares from IBKR in the pre-market, when volume was thin, to try to drive the price down and cover at market open after doing  a stop loss raid. They wanted to do it in the pre-market, because under rule 10b UWMC can't do their buyback until the market opens. I caught it, and explained what was happening, but the post was removed. After the post was removed, at exactly 9:30, roughly 100k shares were covered. Please note this is in reverse order, and you can just see it yourself at Iborrow:

 87.3 %150,000 2021-05-19 09:30:03

87.3 % 55,000 2021-05-19 09:15:03

87.3 % 55,00020 21-05-19 09:00:03

93.9 % 200,000 2021-05-18 16:45:03 

Let's break down the numbers here. If a shorter borrowed 1M to borrow at a 93.7% rate, the calculation for what they'd pay that day would be: 1,000,000\*.937= 63,000. Then you divide by 365. That would cost the shorter 172.6$ to short it for the day. 

Now, the shorting activity caused the price to go down 3.59%. So 1,000,000\*1.0359=1,035,900.

That nets you a profit of 35,900-172.6=$35,728

I'm sure people paper handed at a loss, because they got scared. Not many people are sophisticated investors, and to be blunt, not many sophisticated investors are actually sophisticated because the requirements to be labelled one don't actually apply to knowledge for the mots part. They don't know what goes on, and just look at a stock go green and FOMO in, and look at it go red and paper sell for a loss.

As for the Technical Analysis, i guess I misflaired it as DD instead of Technical Analysis?

I'd also like to make it clear regarding something. The ""I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise"" thing is a meme. Or i thought you guys were meming, but apparently i need to lay it out. 

The investment advisor act of 1940 sets forth the definition for an investment advisor. There are three requirements to be defined as an investment advisor (financial advisor). 1) You need to be paid, 2) to give financial advise, 3) regarding a security. So, for example, if I gave you advice as a financial coach regarding personal finance the SEC wouldn't care. I would only need to be licensed and required to have a fiduciary duty of care to you if I was a financial coach that was being compensated by you and told you you should buy Microsoft. 

Furthermore, you also don't need to register with the SEC as a financial advisor unless you have a certain amount of assets under management and that number is high. With that said, each state requires you to register with them, so there is that.

\-All- three of these conditions need to be met for the regulations concerning financial advice and licensure to come into effect and for the SEC to be able to ""nail"" you. Anyone offering DD is not being compensated by you, and thus, does not have a duty of care to you. Market manipulation is also not something that you need to be afraid of, provided that citations to well regarded publications are used, or you refer to GAAP, security filings (Think 8K, 10K's, 13F's etcetera). If someone is providing a stream of citations, like I like to do, I should not be flagged because i am reinforcing my point with objective data points.

Anyways, some suggestions:

1) Reinforce/Update your ruleset and make points of clarification.

2) If you manually remove a post, post why (as Memetron did for my Yolo post), so that the individual can cure the defect and make his post compliant with the rules. If it was a bot, have the bot post the reason why.

3) Add moderators solely for the purpose of responding to modmail. I requested a reasoning as to why one of my posts was deleted three weeks ago, and it was never responded to. 

4) Unironically, you should probably crowdfund so that one of you can go have a consultation with a Securities Attorney on behalf of this sub. Preferably one that was previously in the enforcement division of the SEC in a past life. Take notes on what he says, and you could even pay the individual to write you a content guideline that will act as a CYA, since you all obviously feel compelled to (even though you're not personally liable). Furthermore, you guys don't actually know much about what is and isn't allowable under the investment act of 34 & 40, and so honestly its probably best you get a crash course in securities regulation and a ruleset that appropriately accounts for securities regulations. This will probably not happen, but Wikipedia does it, so it's not a total lost cause.",ngdffm,"Mods, We Need To Have A Discussion About Your Ruleset."

Saying the mortgage interest credit is keeping the housing prices inflated is like saying the captain pissing his pants is what flooded the Titanic.  Technically it contributes, but on such a small scale it doesn‚Äôt make an impact.   

As you mentioned, a huge swath of the population doesn‚Äôt even technically pay taxes after numerous deductions.  The few people who take the itemized deductions, and therefore are able to utilize the mortgage interest deduction, are typically reporting enough income, and therefore paying (typically a lot) of taxes.    

In short, OP says the homeowners mortgage interest credit is keeping home prices high by incentivizing large mortgages.    I‚Äôm saying virtually no-one benefits from those because only a small set of the population itemizes.  For those that do, State Taxes and Medical Expenses are generally a more relevant decision.",,

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there‚Äôs anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I‚Äôm interested in hearing other opinions on this.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DD
2071,,2021-05-18 14:19:53,t3_nfbwv5,,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,UWMC has a business model that should weather the storm much better.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,$AMC TA - BROKE OUT BIG LAST WEEK - BEST SETUP SINCE THE FIRST SQUEEZE - NEEDS TO BREAK KEY RESISTANCE FOR ROCKETS THRUSTERS TO ENGAGE AGAIN

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let‚Äôs face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

I'll explain more in the commentary below.

So, before I begin, I just want to state that I respect the work you guys put into moderating this sub. At 10.1 million degenerates, that's a lot of work. With that said, I have concerns regarding your ruleset. Namely that when multiple posts get removed, people aren't actually aware of the reason for it. Posts that otherwise meet the criteria to be posted, are otherwise removed. The reasoning, i suspect, is because your ruleset is extremely vague and leaves a lot of discretion. Clarifying, and expanding, your ruleset would likely fix this, and I have some suggestions.

First, while you are under no legal obligation to moderate the content of this sub board under section 230, I appreciate you are assuming a duty of care to your community to ensure that they are somewhat protected. With that said, your ruleset and your content guidelines could stand to be strengthened. In point of fact, you are removing content that objectively meets your content guidelines. 

Case in point is that I made an update to my YOLO, nearly a month after my last YOLO, and that was because i had very significantly added to my position since then. However, Memetron removed the post, and was kind enough to tell me that YOLO updates were not allowed now even though DFV had been doing them. I told him that i wasn't aware there had been a rule change since then, and apologized. However, under your content guidelines  [linkflair - wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/linkflair#wiki_yolo) , there is no rule restricting what I did and I actually met the YOLO content guideline to appropriately post a YOLO. Nevertheless, I'm not actually mad about it.

What i am a little annoyed by is that my post regarding the shorting in the pre-market of UWMC was removed, even though i provided a factual basis for everything there. Shorters borrowed 145,000 shares from IBKR in the pre-market, when volume was thin, to try to drive the price down and cover at market open after doing  a stop loss raid. They wanted to do it in the pre-market, because under rule 10b UWMC can't do their buyback until the market opens. I caught it, and explained what was happening, but the post was removed. After the post was removed, at exactly 9:30, roughly 100k shares were covered. Please note this is in reverse order, and you can just see it yourself at Iborrow:

 87.3 %150,000 2021-05-19 09:30:03

87.3 % 55,000 2021-05-19 09:15:03

87.3 % 55,00020 21-05-19 09:00:03

93.9 % 200,000 2021-05-18 16:45:03 

Let's break down the numbers here. If a shorter borrowed 1M to borrow at a 93.7% rate, the calculation for what they'd pay that day would be: 1,000,000\*.937= 63,000. Then you divide by 365. That would cost the shorter 172.6$ to short it for the day. 

Now, the shorting activity caused the price to go down 3.59%. So 1,000,000\*1.0359=1,035,900.

That nets you a profit of 35,900-172.6=$35,728

I'm sure people paper handed at a loss, because they got scared. Not many people are sophisticated investors, and to be blunt, not many sophisticated investors are actually sophisticated because the requirements to be labelled one don't actually apply to knowledge for the mots part. They don't know what goes on, and just look at a stock go green and FOMO in, and look at it go red and paper sell for a loss.

As for the Technical Analysis, i guess I misflaired it as DD instead of Technical Analysis?

I'd also like to make it clear regarding something. The ""I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise"" thing is a meme. Or i thought you guys were meming, but apparently i need to lay it out. 

The investment advisor act of 1940 sets forth the definition for an investment advisor. There are three requirements to be defined as an investment advisor (financial advisor). 1) You need to be paid, 2) to give financial advise, 3) regarding a security. So, for example, if I gave you advice as a financial coach regarding personal finance the SEC wouldn't care. I would only need to be licensed and required to have a fiduciary duty of care to you if I was a financial coach that was being compensated by you and told you you should buy Microsoft. 

Furthermore, you also don't need to register with the SEC as a financial advisor unless you have a certain amount of assets under management and that number is high. With that said, each state requires you to register with them, so there is that.

\-All- three of these conditions need to be met for the regulations concerning financial advice and licensure to come into effect and for the SEC to be able to ""nail"" you. Anyone offering DD is not being compensated by you, and thus, does not have a duty of care to you. Market manipulation is also not something that you need to be afraid of, provided that citations to well regarded publications are used, or you refer to GAAP, security filings (Think 8K, 10K's, 13F's etcetera). If someone is providing a stream of citations, like I like to do, I should not be flagged because i am reinforcing my point with objective data points.

Anyways, some suggestions:

1) Reinforce/Update your ruleset and make points of clarification.

2) If you manually remove a post, post why (as Memetron did for my Yolo post), so that the individual can cure the defect and make his post compliant with the rules. If it was a bot, have the bot post the reason why.

3) Add moderators solely for the purpose of responding to modmail. I requested a reasoning as to why one of my posts was deleted three weeks ago, and it was never responded to. 

4) Unironically, you should probably crowdfund so that one of you can go have a consultation with a Securities Attorney on behalf of this sub. Preferably one that was previously in the enforcement division of the SEC in a past life. Take notes on what he says, and you could even pay the individual to write you a content guideline that will act as a CYA, since you all obviously feel compelled to (even though you're not personally liable). Furthermore, you guys don't actually know much about what is and isn't allowable under the investment act of 34 & 40, and so honestly its probably best you get a crash course in securities regulation and a ruleset that appropriately accounts for securities regulations. This will probably not happen, but Wikipedia does it, so it's not a total lost cause.",ngdffm,"Mods, We Need To Have A Discussion About Your Ruleset."

She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

WISH is not an e-commerce company - they‚Äôre a technology company. More than half their revenue is now in logistics and advertising. Wish provides a platform for merchants to sell products from more than just China. They do not make the products; bad products and bad merchants get delisted from the app. 

The average rating across Android and Apple app stores is 4.6 stars - almost 20 million reviews in total. 

They just hired a new executive chair that previously worked at Alibaba and Square. 

Alibaba and Amazon were both previously interested in strategic acquisitions of WISH. 

The company was privately valued at 3x the current market cap. 

The company has more than 50% of their revenue coming from outside the US; Europe is their biggest market currently, but WISH was the number one downloaded app in India for April and is seeing huge growth in Africa. 

They have $1.8 Billion in cash and no debt; they‚Äôre not currently trying to be profitable because they‚Äôre investing heavily in higher dollar spends for their monthly active users, higher quality monthly active users, logistics and their advertising platform. 

As a short-term trend, the stock has been heavily shorted and e-commerce brands have been rotated away from (see ETSY and POSH as examples); POSH hit a 52w low on the same day. I anticipate this hitting 2x the current price before the end of the year. Building good support at $9 now and small Green Day currently on a bad market Wednesday.",,

We don‚Äôt teach homophobic beliefs. You can perceive them to be whatever you want, but there‚Äôs plenty of people from all parts of the gender/sexuality spectrum that would agree with me. 

‚ÄúThe Church distinguishes between same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior. People who experience same-sex attraction or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual can make and keep covenants with God and fully and worthily participate in the Church. Identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual or experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin and does not prohibit one from participating in the Church, holding callings, or attending the temple.‚Äù

‚ÄúSexual purity is an essential part of God‚Äôs plan for our happiness. Sexual relations are reserved for a man and woman who are married and promise complete loyalty to each other. Sexual relations between a man and woman who are not married, or between people of the same sex, violate one of our Father in Heaven‚Äôs most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress.‚Äù

By your logic, God is homophobic. We didn‚Äôt just pull these ideas out of nowhere. The family is ordained of God between a man and a woman, and it‚Äôs been like that for centuries. I knew two gay men on my mission. One i taught and eventually got baptized. Catholic man, knew of all the policies and ideas taught in the church, never once thought they were homophobic. The other was a lifelong member. Completely celibate. Never thought it was homophobic. 

Shared perception doesn‚Äôt equate to truth, but if you spend time looking at it from a Spiritual perspective instead of worldly frustration and mindsets, you‚Äôll actually understand what is going on.",,

All IBorrowDesk data is sourced from Interactive Brokers. You can check the source .csv files here.  
  
It's important to understand that because IBorrowDesk only reports data from a single (albeit very large) brokerage, the fee and availability reported may be different at other brokerages.""

If it's in regards to the incomplete data sets regarding all shares borrowed by every broker, you're right in that I don't have that, but I CAN look at volume. And then i can make some calculations. 

Is it a precise science? No. But more often than not you can cut through the noise, if you know where to look and how to look.",,

Use common sense for half a second. There are only to possibilities, either the LDS faith is legit, or its all a scam. IF it is legit, then God makes those commandments. And if God made those commandments, who are you to tell Him what he can or cannot do? Are you somehow God's boss? 

And if it's NOT real, then using the internal argument that it's wrong BECAUSE it demands tithing is cyclical and illogical. So either it is all wrong and tithing is thereby wrong by extension, OR, it is all right. It cannot be wrong BECAUSE it asks for tithing because within that premise God is the one asking. 

This isn't a matter of opinion. This is very straight forward logic. 

So calm down and chill out. And once again charity work is not the only function of a church and a reserve fund does not mean it needs to be spent. You have a great deal of audacity to walk into a room and tell a church how to spend their money. What in the world do you actually know about the purpose of that reserve fun? Just because they have money its evil? Seriously, I am beyond reasoning with this level of bias. You are ignoring common sense entirely and are circling back to ""having money is wrong because they're an evil church"" and not addressing why having money is wrong in the first place. 

I get that you have your reasons, but if you're going to engage in dialogue check your childish biases and tantrums at the door and communicate with logic and rational sense. You don't get a free pass because you were hurt by something. Seriously, do not waste my time with spurious statements and arguments.",,

My whole point is that they shouldn't be allowed to do that shit at all while claiming tax-exempt status. In fact, I don't think they should even have tax-exempt status in the first place, nor should any religious institution (and that includes *Muslim* religious institutions, since you seem so concerned about them for some reason).

Also, I don't keep track of my charity donations. I donate as much as I can whenever I can, but I don't keep track or claim it on my taxes because I don't donate to get a fucking tax break. I also don't make very much money in the first place, so I donate my time much more than the very limited amount of money that I have. I rescue dogs with health and/or behavioral problems (I currently have four, as well as a rescue cat) and I pay for their extensive medical bills as well as take on whatever special care th y might need. I also volunteer for the local dog park, humane society, and habitat for humanity. I am also active on the Nextdoor app so I can help my neighbors in need whenever I am able to do so. 

Lastly, I never ""overpay"" my taxes. Despite claiming 0 allowances and withholding at higher single rate even though I am married, my husband and I still owe every year. I have no idea why, but like I said I don't make a lot of money so I can't afford the $200-$300 to pay an accountant to look at them, and the internet has been no help. I owe about $700-$900 every year, and I pay it in monthly installments because I can't afford that much money all at once. Not sure why any of that is relevant at all though, but you seem intent on deflecting from the subject at hand in any way you can.",,

During the tech bust the last few months, she shown any shorts or derivatives to profit on the down market. Coinbit to 500,000k is a bit ridiculous, however given its limited supply (21m) and inflationary markets, it could be looked at as a digital commodity which will keep it rising.

Netflix however is a company that I have felt could be in trouble for a while now. Given that anybody that owns content is starting their own streaming service, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for them to keep Netflix as a middle man because they offer a currently premium streaming platform. While they do own some of their own content, I feel like it is very hit or miss and that could drive consumers to look at their competitors. While their financial are healthy in the present state, I feel they could fall victim to diminishing margins very quickly. The one wild card for me with Netflix is that they could go out and buy some content through M&A activity that  could make them a player for a longer time.
 
That is just my opinion on it though, however I can respect the other side of the argument as well",,

>This organization DOES NOT invite men to have sex with younger girls

That is true. Currently it does not. This is because the Mormons were driven out of all of their early settlements and eventually wanted Utah to be granted statehood. They had to put those practices away. 

>please ponder who knows more about the history of my church. I have been a member for more than 16 years and find great interest in its history.

My man, I've got 34 years in this stuff. Was in charge of missionaries over four US states. Also served a mission myself and eventually had to apologize to all of my converts

My path in life came as a result of having an inquisitive personality like yours. I also find great interest in its history. I will say, I *wish* I still believed it and understand why people don't want to let it go even once they learn the truth about it. I love my fam very much and to think that I won't see them again after death was the most bitter pill I've had to swallow with all of this. 

But again, the current LDS church is not involved in these practices today. I fully agree. 

>Secondly, people like to get all high and mighty when they hear we give 10% of our income to the church.

Haha yeah they do. The 10% thing never bothered me much

>that isn't a bad thing, because if times require for action on our part my money will be used in helping others. :)

Eh, not from tithing. You'd need to indicate on your tithing slip that you'd like your money to go to humanitarian aid, but it would *not* count toward your 10%

>Most people think that we abuse and mistreat women like this

Historically the women were abused, but I agree it's overplayed today. These days people are referring to things like women, but not men, having to veil their faces in the temple. Or only men being allowed to be given the priesthood. In 2021, people want to see zero distinction between men and women which I think is stupid. There are differences between genders and I don't see why anyone has an issue embracing that. We're just humans.",,

The pandemic boosts, as well as what wages are available, plays a *much* larger role in whether people are in a rush to go back to work or not. If the unemployment rate is 6.1% now and it was 3.5% before the lockdown, we're already pretty close to normalizing. But after being stay-at-home parents for over a year, I'm not surprised working class people aren't in a rush to go back to their shitty jobs and then turn around and pay most of that for daycare.

Because it can't be faked, you cannot spend it twice so you can use it as a currency to facilitate trade and transfer of value. Well the same is true for gold. You can verify by yourself that you hold a genuine peace of gold in a few seconds without any expensive equipment. Actually even more so because bitcoin security relies on the fact that we currently don't know how to perform certain computations efficiently, but we don't have any kind of proof that it is impossible so this might not hold true in the future. And gold properties are dictated by the laws of physics and you can easily measure them by yourself.

You just need to check its weight, dimensions, magnetic properties (it is not not-magnetic, it is actually weakly diamagnetic, so it is repelled by a magnet. It is at the same time an excellent conductor so magnetic field is strongly induced in it) and the sound it makes when hit by something. Yes, it is impractical for everyday use, definitely, but think about it: it's actually quite unique that when you have a strong magnet, a precise weight, a vessel with some water and a smartphone with bullion sound verification app you can make yourself truly 100% sure that that 1 ounce gold coin is really pure gold. Can you be that much certain that a 100 dollar bill is not fake? Not even close. Bitcoin, like I said, you cannot be that certain. Money in you bank account or stock in your Robinhood account?

Christians in 'Murica are allowed to eat snail. Just because they chose not to, doesn't mean Christians aren't allowed to eat snail.

And halal goes far beyond it not being pork. Even beef and chicken are not halal unless slaughter according to religious law.

And to confuse you even more, anything kosher is halal for muslims to eat. But observing jews cannot eat halal. It has to be kosher.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there‚Äôs anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I‚Äôm interested in hearing other opinions on this.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm here with another DD, but this time it‚Äôll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I‚Äôve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DD

Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,UWMC has a business model that should weather the storm much better.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:

The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let‚Äôs face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

I'll explain more in the commentary below.

So, before I begin, I just want to state that I respect the work you guys put into moderating this sub. At 10.1 million degenerates, that's a lot of work. With that said, I have concerns regarding your ruleset. Namely that when multiple posts get removed, people aren't actually aware of the reason for it. Posts that otherwise meet the criteria to be posted, are otherwise removed. The reasoning, i suspect, is because your ruleset is extremely vague and leaves a lot of discretion. Clarifying, and expanding, your ruleset would likely fix this, and I have some suggestions.

First, while you are under no legal obligation to moderate the content of this sub board under section 230, I appreciate you are assuming a duty of care to your community to ensure that they are somewhat protected. With that said, your ruleset and your content guidelines could stand to be strengthened. In point of fact, you are removing content that objectively meets your content guidelines. 

Case in point is that I made an update to my YOLO, nearly a month after my last YOLO, and that was because i had very significantly added to my position since then. However, Memetron removed the post, and was kind enough to tell me that YOLO updates were not allowed now even though DFV had been doing them. I told him that i wasn't aware there had been a rule change since then, and apologized. However, under your content guidelines  [linkflair - wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/linkflair#wiki_yolo) , there is no rule restricting what I did and I actually met the YOLO content guideline to appropriately post a YOLO. Nevertheless, I'm not actually mad about it.

What i am a little annoyed by is that my post regarding the shorting in the pre-market of UWMC was removed, even though i provided a factual basis for everything there. Shorters borrowed 145,000 shares from IBKR in the pre-market, when volume was thin, to try to drive the price down and cover at market open after doing  a stop loss raid. They wanted to do it in the pre-market, because under rule 10b UWMC can't do their buyback until the market opens. I caught it, and explained what was happening, but the post was removed. After the post was removed, at exactly 9:30, roughly 100k shares were covered. Please note this is in reverse order, and you can just see it yourself at Iborrow:

 87.3 %150,000 2021-05-19 09:30:03

87.3 % 55,000 2021-05-19 09:15:03

87.3 % 55,00020 21-05-19 09:00:03

93.9 % 200,000 2021-05-18 16:45:03 

Let's break down the numbers here. If a shorter borrowed 1M to borrow at a 93.7% rate, the calculation for what they'd pay that day would be: 1,000,000\*.937= 63,000. Then you divide by 365. That would cost the shorter 172.6$ to short it for the day. 

Now, the shorting activity caused the price to go down 3.59%. So 1,000,000\*1.0359=1,035,900.

That nets you a profit of 35,900-172.6=$35,728

I'm sure people paper handed at a loss, because they got scared. Not many people are sophisticated investors, and to be blunt, not many sophisticated investors are actually sophisticated because the requirements to be labelled one don't actually apply to knowledge for the mots part. They don't know what goes on, and just look at a stock go green and FOMO in, and look at it go red and paper sell for a loss.

As for the Technical Analysis, i guess I misflaired it as DD instead of Technical Analysis?

I'd also like to make it clear regarding something. The ""I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise"" thing is a meme. Or i thought you guys were meming, but apparently i need to lay it out. 

The investment advisor act of 1940 sets forth the definition for an investment advisor. There are three requirements to be defined as an investment advisor (financial advisor). 1) You need to be paid, 2) to give financial advise, 3) regarding a security. So, for example, if I gave you advice as a financial coach regarding personal finance the SEC wouldn't care. I would only need to be licensed and required to have a fiduciary duty of care to you if I was a financial coach that was being compensated by you and told you you should buy Microsoft. 

Furthermore, you also don't need to register with the SEC as a financial advisor unless you have a certain amount of assets under management and that number is high. With that said, each state requires you to register with them, so there is that.

\-All- three of these conditions need to be met for the regulations concerning financial advice and licensure to come into effect and for the SEC to be able to ""nail"" you. Anyone offering DD is not being compensated by you, and thus, does not have a duty of care to you. Market manipulation is also not something that you need to be afraid of, provided that citations to well regarded publications are used, or you refer to GAAP, security filings (Think 8K, 10K's, 13F's etcetera). If someone is providing a stream of citations, like I like to do, I should not be flagged because i am reinforcing my point with objective data points.

Anyways, some suggestions:

1) Reinforce/Update your ruleset and make points of clarification.

2) If you manually remove a post, post why (as Memetron did for my Yolo post), so that the individual can cure the defect and make his post compliant with the rules. If it was a bot, have the bot post the reason why.

3) Add moderators solely for the purpose of responding to modmail. I requested a reasoning as to why one of my posts was deleted three weeks ago, and it was never responded to. 

4) Unironically, you should probably crowdfund so that one of you can go have a consultation with a Securities Attorney on behalf of this sub. Preferably one that was previously in the enforcement division of the SEC in a past life. Take notes on what he says, and you could even pay the individual to write you a content guideline that will act as a CYA, since you all obviously feel compelled to (even though you're not personally liable). Furthermore, you guys don't actually know much about what is and isn't allowable under the investment act of 34 & 40, and so honestly its probably best you get a crash course in securities regulation and a ruleset that appropriately accounts for securities regulations. This will probably not happen, but Wikipedia does it, so it's not a total lost cause.",ngdffm,"Mods, We Need To Have A Discussion About Your Ruleset."

Did I say they are NOT allowed to eat pork?

They don't eat pork because of people like YOU hanging around in their communitiy... Appreciate Hindus are nice people. Don't give them a hard time.

Don't believe me, ask them... Make sure you ask, ask, ask, pretty sure you get some enlightened Hindus who will tell you the truth... Don't assume like how you assume there is Genie Power.

\> Christians in 'Murica are allowed to eat snail. 

Now I gotta call you a Jahiliyyah... Christians got an update from God, it's called the New Testament, wherein God say ""All IS Clean Now""... THee may chow down anything... Pork, Lobster, Bloody Shark, Mandarin Duck... Save for the toxic ones, just eat for all food created by me is nutritious.

\> anything kosher is halal for muslims to eat. But observing jews cannot eat halal. It has to be kosher.

So, Kosher is Halal, Halal is not Kosher... What does that mean? 

To me, it means Halal is nonsense... serve no purpose whatsoever... Ignore it.

 Dont get a loan!! What ever you do, think about it, this has you hooked just like the lottery!! Every one keeps buying becuse they know they have a small chance to win.

My suggestion. Find a good long term company and put the cash you have left in there. 

Then dont look at any chart for a year and go find your passion and what makes you happy, and eventually find a job doing what you love.

BTW please never make another decision due to FOMO. It bad I've learned from my own mistakes, I lost 15k from FOMO, so now any time I get the slightest feeling of FOMO I stop and remember what happend last time, and I just forget about the Fomo and move on to somthing else to occupy my mind.
Think of it this way if you have Fomo you got in too late and your not going to make that much any way, and you have to be quick to sell so you dont get stuck, it's just all bad.

Good luck my friend, and just slow down and think, start listing to real financial advisers, and be careful about what you learn on youtube.

-There is money you can spend on architecture R&D, like their cool chiplet shit. But AMD are already spending $1.5B there and that's already up 25% yoy, like how much more gasoline can you throw on that fire.

-AMD's stock has been losing value for absolute bullshit reasons and is at a buy-low point.

They are throwing cash into buybacks because they can't grow sales for any amount of money right now and their stock is legitimately undervalued. I would've looked into acquisitions with that $4B myself, but if you're low and tech is pretty high, I can see why you would bet on yourself.",,

I'm looking to increase position to about 50k in shares and 25k in long dated calls. I'm stopping out below 33-34 but this thing will rocket with states starting to adopt online gambling and with sports starting back in full swing this fall.

This will jump to previous highs very quickly, 15B market cap, losing money to pay for advertisements but revenue expectation raised from 900M to 1.15B this year. 13 potential states opening up within the next 2 years to legalized gambling. International bettors hopefully get a piece of the action as well. It's only a matter of time. You'll be kicking yourself in 10 years when this, PENN and others are trading 5x from here.

Also I think the bottom is almost in for growth stocks, we have seen fear and capitulation take over the last 3 months as retail traders bleed themselves out. When you hear about people giving up that's the best time to get back in.

It makes it hard to see the ""request for clarification"" as unbiased. One of the top upvoted posts there this week is literally a crosspost saying ""upvote this [on wallstreetbets]"". Actually, most of them are if you look at it, they just don't all say it so outright.

You know you can't do that, right? I don't report subreddits for brigading, but it's lame. Perhaps you should talk to your community about doing things that are both against Reddit rules and probably more in the realm of 'manipulation' or things that would require legal counsel than anything people dream up as happening here. We can only be so fancy with our spam-fighting methods. It's gonna take down good posts sometimes. I was thinking about making a little custom sidebar widget that lists the last active mods online so they're easier to contact when it gets it wrong.

I'm very much open to hear other sides of the argument, and we aren't actively taught that in church at all. Yes, sometimes we like to tune out the naysayers because we want to focus on what we believe matters, you have a point, but not all of us are completely oblivious and ignorant of the other side of the argument. It is worth noting that I could say the same about you, rehearsing your doubts about the church with other doubters creates confirmation bias as well. Maybe I do have confirmation bias, but we all have biases though, don't we? I will have to disagree that everything you said was factually correct. Polygamy is a touchy subject, and even was for the early Saints. Joseph Smith himself didn't like the idea. 

>The fact is, the Mormon church was created for old perverts to fuck little girls  
Founder Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

Do you recall how church leadership positions are appointed? Could you show me some tangible historic evidence that proves this, like Joseph Smith's own journals and writings or something of the sort? And yes, Heber C Kimball had multiple wives, and as far as I know they were not young girls. Even if they were young girls, how would those crimes committed centuries ago prove to the world that our beliefs are false? What is your point? Why was the church created, and why is it bad?

>My man, I've got 34 years in this stuff. Was in charge of missionaries over four US states. Also served a mission myself and eventually had to apologize to all of my converts

What is there to apologize for? 

>Or only men being allowed to be given the priesthood.

What is the priesthood to you? 

>In 2021, people want to see zero distinction between men and women which I think is stupid. There are differences between genders and I don't see why anyone has an issue embracing that. We're just humans.

Could not agree more! I think we have a lot in common. As I reading your message, I'm wondering if the reason why you left the church was because of the struggles that the early Saints had and the bad reputation concerning it? Anyways, I really appreciate the civility on your part, it's easy to get worked up over these kinds of things!",,

We could have been born in ancient greece following their polytheistic gods. That group faded away with time like thousands of other manmade religions/cults. You were likely (like I was too) born into mormonism. You think THIS TIME it's different? It's just yet another manmade hoax of OUR time. 

How do we know? Look at it objectively. The creator of the group conned people into thinking he could find hidden treasure with stones in a hat, which failed, and he was sent to court over it. He claimed to use this same method (stones in a hat) as he was creating the book of mormon. Why did he con people into thinking he's a treasure hunter? Hmm... maybe he was a conman?   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph\_Smith\_and\_the\_criminal\_justice\_system  


Furthermore, this book that he created has been revealed to be a complete hoax. It's not archaeologically accurate with its depiction of pre-columbian america at all according to any reputable archaelogists (like those at the Smithsonian). No horses or metallurgy existed during that time for example. And no, people didn't ride tapirs into battle. No trace of DNA linking native americans to Israel. The whole book is a sham that is CLEARLY false.   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology\_and\_the\_Book\_of\_Mormon  


He then creates another book (Book of Abraham) that he claimed to translate from egyptian papyrii  (I saw it displayed when I was at BYU) With the rosetta stone, we can now translate those papyrii and it has been revealed that it is not his book and is instead a typical egyptian funeral document called the book of breathings. He did NOT translate that, it was yet another lie.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Abraham  


Then you have these ""prophets"" who are supposed to have forward thinking insight from a god. Yet, instead we get extreme outdated hatred, like Brigham Young's racist quote that interracial couples should be slain on the spot. Or that black people are cursed by being less valiant in the pre-existence. Taught for 100+ years and it took them decades after the civil rights movement to alter their views... this is the opposite of ""inspired"". And now they are doing the same with gay marriage while the rest of the world is more progressive. They'll change that in time too, after everyone else. Not inspired.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_people\_and\_Mormonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_Mormonism)  


I only mentioned 5% of the things that reveal this is a hoax. How much do you need? Logically and empirically, this is a hoax. Now, not only this, but they are requiring 10% of member incomes to STAY WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE AFTERLIFE. When I left, my mother cried because she thought I wasn't going to be with her in the afterlife. How messed up is that? It's an absolute cult. I was just like you once.

This is one of the thousands of items mentioned in Kashrut Law. It's Jewish culture/belief, adopted by Arabs but never orginally Islam... Make no mistake here.

BTW, you may wanna google for some gruesome videos that feature the so called Kosher/Halal slaughtering technology... They say it's primitives, barbaric, cruel, and worse of all TOXIC!

**Halal is TOXIC?** 

According to food scientists, animals slaughtered with Kosher/Halal slaughtering technology will release some kind of toxins into their brain/bloodstream... too much suffering!

Trading stocks is actually quite easy. Its making money while trading stocks that is difficult. I would consider opening an online brokerage account (I use Etrade), and giving paper trading a try, which is basically trading stocks with pretend money. That way, you get a feel for trading stocks without losing (or making) money. Its a good way to learn the ropes and how the mechanics of online stock trading. 

Once you know how to buy/sell stocks, the next step is figuring out which stocks to buy/sell. Thats where your own due diligence and research comes into play. There are some really good books on this topic, but the goal is to identify a stock you think will go up sometime in the near future. For me, I just read as much as I can about a company; what do they do, how they do it, what industry, are they doing something no one else is doing, or doing it in a different/way, etc. Then buy some shares, maybe a small amount at first, and just see what happens.

What's their charitable percentage then? You probably don't know (they won't tell you) and/or you have to admit it's likely very low compared to their net gains. That's the point. It's a mega corporation masquerading as a charity/religion. 

>The church has pretty clear political neutrality policies

Except when it has ""religious implications"" as you said, which is when they decide to step in and exert their influence. That's exactly what I'm talking about. They are still exerting their influence on politics. They shouldn't be putting money towards anti-gay-marriage propositions. They shouldn't be sending letters to all their members saying their position on medicinal marijuana while having billions invested in big pharma companies. You are biased, which means you likely will not consider this objectively, but perhaps you can open your mind enough to see that is wrong.   
 

>If you think 501(3)(c) should be done away with and churches taxed, that's fine as an opinion

Yes, I am indeed saying that a mega corporation pretending to be a religion should be taxed like an MLM that it is. 

Furthermore, of course I have a ""sore spot""? I, like many, spent my childhood being lied to. I had to go to BYU to find out many parts of mormon history and theology I was never told. I was brought up on milk rather than meat. The whole thing is an absolute sham, a collection of harmful lies, not unlike their earlier racist teachings. Imagine me being left out of my sister's wedding simply because I'm not a member of their group. Or to see people being conned into giving 10% of their income to a mega billion dollar corporation while they struggle to get by. No, this group is absolutely a cult (now a mega corporation) and I'm here to speak out against it. I hope you wake up like many of us have.",,

Inflation is always... ALWAYS the bogeyman, but remember the chatter about it always spikes when there is a definate movement towards raising the minimum wage. This doomsday scenario never comes.  


The only real issue is social instability and global conflict points flaring up (Middle East, US Race Relations, Russia, China) that would really spook the markets.

Remember, gambling is a way to generate wealth because you'll win eventually, it's just a matter of time. Keep your losses a secret from family and friends, that way when you get a big win you can surprise them!  Money isn't real, so borrow as much as you need to break even.

After pointing these out you simply ignore them and rant about something else. I am not here for you to shout your personal biases and hatred towards the LDS faith.

For example:
'This world that we live in has a LONG history of religions that are scams and false. We could have been born in ancient greece following their polytheistic gods. That group faded away with time like thousands of other manmade religions/cults. You were likely (like I was too) born into mormonism. You think THIS TIME it's different? It's just yet another manmade hoax of OUR time.""

First of all, you don't know anything about my current or past beliefs. You know absolutely nothing. 

The existence of past hoaxes is not grounds to conclude that this is currently a hoax. It's this kind of fallacy that is annoying. Again I am not here to debate the nitty gritty despite the fact that our knowledge of the events may different. And just because one person you knew said something about Tapir's doesn't represent anyone else. This is the first time I've ever heard that used. 

I have addressed the fallacies you spouted and have held to my stance that I am not here to debate religion, only to address said fallacies. Rant your arguments in another direction because I have no issue with you believing what you do.",,

Not true at all, they hide their history under the rug an extensive amount. 

As a member growing up, I remember seeing all these depictions of Joseph Smith ""translating"" the book of mormon with the plates set in front of him. Little did I know until I was at BYU that he actually shoved his head in a top hat to look at some stones with the plates being nowhere in sight (because they didn't exist) the same method he used to con people into thinking he could find treasure and was taken to court over.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early\_life\_of\_Joseph\_Smith#Treasure\_hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith#Treasure_hunting)  


I remember going to a film they made about Joseph Smith's life and guess how many mentions of polygamy were there? That's right, 0. 

This is a small fraction of things that I WAS NOT taught as a member for 20 years so please, stop distorting reality here. They absolutely have a history of misrepresenting their history, it's something you should accept, they have always lied.",,

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

1D Timeframe

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

I'll explain more in the commentary below.

So, before I begin, I just want to state that I respect the work you guys put into moderating this sub. At 10.1 million degenerates, that's a lot of work. With that said, I have concerns regarding your ruleset. Namely that when multiple posts get removed, people aren't actually aware of the reason for it. Posts that otherwise meet the criteria to be posted, are otherwise removed. The reasoning, i suspect, is because your ruleset is extremely vague and leaves a lot of discretion. Clarifying, and expanding, your ruleset would likely fix this, and I have some suggestions.

First, while you are under no legal obligation to moderate the content of this sub board under section 230, I appreciate you are assuming a duty of care to your community to ensure that they are somewhat protected. With that said, your ruleset and your content guidelines could stand to be strengthened. In point of fact, you are removing content that objectively meets your content guidelines. 

Case in point is that I made an update to my YOLO, nearly a month after my last YOLO, and that was because i had very significantly added to my position since then. However, Memetron removed the post, and was kind enough to tell me that YOLO updates were not allowed now even though DFV had been doing them. I told him that i wasn't aware there had been a rule change since then, and apologized. However, under your content guidelines  [linkflair - wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/linkflair#wiki_yolo) , there is no rule restricting what I did and I actually met the YOLO content guideline to appropriately post a YOLO. Nevertheless, I'm not actually mad about it.

What i am a little annoyed by is that my post regarding the shorting in the pre-market of UWMC was removed, even though i provided a factual basis for everything there. Shorters borrowed 145,000 shares from IBKR in the pre-market, when volume was thin, to try to drive the price down and cover at market open after doing  a stop loss raid. They wanted to do it in the pre-market, because under rule 10b UWMC can't do their buyback until the market opens. I caught it, and explained what was happening, but the post was removed. After the post was removed, at exactly 9:30, roughly 100k shares were covered. Please note this is in reverse order, and you can just see it yourself at Iborrow:

 87.3 %150,000 2021-05-19 09:30:03

87.3 % 55,000 2021-05-19 09:15:03

87.3 % 55,00020 21-05-19 09:00:03

93.9 % 200,000 2021-05-18 16:45:03 

Let's break down the numbers here. If a shorter borrowed 1M to borrow at a 93.7% rate, the calculation for what they'd pay that day would be: 1,000,000\*.937= 63,000. Then you divide by 365. That would cost the shorter 172.6$ to short it for the day. 

Now, the shorting activity caused the price to go down 3.59%. So 1,000,000\*1.0359=1,035,900.

That nets you a profit of 35,900-172.6=$35,728

I'm sure people paper handed at a loss, because they got scared. Not many people are sophisticated investors, and to be blunt, not many sophisticated investors are actually sophisticated because the requirements to be labelled one don't actually apply to knowledge for the mots part. They don't know what goes on, and just look at a stock go green and FOMO in, and look at it go red and paper sell for a loss.

As for the Technical Analysis, i guess I misflaired it as DD instead of Technical Analysis?

I'd also like to make it clear regarding something. The ""I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise"" thing is a meme. Or i thought you guys were meming, but apparently i need to lay it out. 

The investment advisor act of 1940 sets forth the definition for an investment advisor. There are three requirements to be defined as an investment advisor (financial advisor). 1) You need to be paid, 2) to give financial advise, 3) regarding a security. So, for example, if I gave you advice as a financial coach regarding personal finance the SEC wouldn't care. I would only need to be licensed and required to have a fiduciary duty of care to you if I was a financial coach that was being compensated by you and told you you should buy Microsoft. 

Furthermore, you also don't need to register with the SEC as a financial advisor unless you have a certain amount of assets under management and that number is high. With that said, each state requires you to register with them, so there is that.

\-All- three of these conditions need to be met for the regulations concerning financial advice and licensure to come into effect and for the SEC to be able to ""nail"" you. Anyone offering DD is not being compensated by you, and thus, does not have a duty of care to you. Market manipulation is also not something that you need to be afraid of, provided that citations to well regarded publications are used, or you refer to GAAP, security filings (Think 8K, 10K's, 13F's etcetera). If someone is providing a stream of citations, like I like to do, I should not be flagged because i am reinforcing my point with objective data points.

Anyways, some suggestions:

1) Reinforce/Update your ruleset and make points of clarification.

2) If you manually remove a post, post why (as Memetron did for my Yolo post), so that the individual can cure the defect and make his post compliant with the rules. If it was a bot, have the bot post the reason why.

3) Add moderators solely for the purpose of responding to modmail. I requested a reasoning as to why one of my posts was deleted three weeks ago, and it was never responded to. 

4) Unironically, you should probably crowdfund so that one of you can go have a consultation with a Securities Attorney on behalf of this sub. Preferably one that was previously in the enforcement division of the SEC in a past life. Take notes on what he says, and you could even pay the individual to write you a content guideline that will act as a CYA, since you all obviously feel compelled to (even though you're not personally liable). Furthermore, you guys don't actually know much about what is and isn't allowable under the investment act of 34 & 40, and so honestly its probably best you get a crash course in securities regulation and a ruleset that appropriately accounts for securities regulations. This will probably not happen, but Wikipedia does it, so it's not a total lost cause.",ngdffm,"Mods, We Need To Have A Discussion About Your Ruleset."

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$APPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. APPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

My idea is to webscrap Dataroma , which has pretty god info about these investors. If someone has made this before, i want to know if these delay in info update is very important, or gains are made in the process.

7848,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

>Use common sense for half a second. There are only two possibilities, either the LDS faith is legit, or its all a scam. IF it is legit, then God makes those commandments. And if God made those commandments, who are you to tell Him what he can or cannot do? Are you somehow God's boss?

Sure, if it's real, this god could require many things. It could require I sacrifice my children to get to heaven. It could absolutely be as messed up as you can imagine. You're taking the viewpoint that it's okay no matter what. I would argue that a god that does this isn't worthy of my worship, even if it's real. And here, a god that separates families and taxes the entrance to heaven isn't worthy of my worship. Punishing me for standing up for what's right would be wrong as well. I will not bow to this god. 

&#x200B;

>And if it's NOT real, then using the internal argument that it's wrong BECAUSE it demands tithing is cyclical and illogical. So either it is all wrong and tithing is thereby wrong by extension, OR, it is all right. It cannot be wrong BECAUSE it asks for tithing because within that premise God is the one asking.

You don't seem to be able to grasp the perspective of someone that doesn't believe in your religion. If it's NOT real, I'm being critical of the LDS org, not your fake god. They are then a mega corporation that is setting up goalpost requirements to attain a made up fantasy that they made up. It's no different than an MLM purporting to cure cancer if you buy their product. And in that sense, you can absolutely be against it. Do you understand now?",,

That was the proverbial canary in the coal mine. There are people in high places talking about more public events being cancelled. There is talk about all airline traffic being halted. Boomers make these big decisions, and are the most afraid right now. The dip is not over... not even close.

Trump is the only one who is keeping this market from doing a full, environmentally unfriendly, 10 gallon per flush spiral down the shitter tube. I'm sure that once one of his advisors tells him that you can make money when the market goes down, all stops are off.

How can we take advantage of this? Well, we help give the boomers the nudge they need (they're hesitant to flush the money they need for their 4th rental property - but they'll do it, if it means getting to live to see millennials get ass fucked by the impending climate crisis).

SO:

    If you're not sick, cough in public. Make sniffle noises. Tell people in the grocery store that something has you under the weather, but you're just not sure what. Remind them that you have to go to work because you live paycheck to paycheck and don't want to be kicked out of your 1br apartment. Touch the produce in front of them (wash your hands after - don't be stupid about this).

    If you ARE sick, touch door handles. Make sure to do a little nose wipe beforehand. Touch common surfaces at your workplace. Go to some sporting events, and make sure to pay with the credit card you've been using to cut your dark web Chinese blow.

    BUY MOTHERFUCKING PUTS. Stop trying to call the bottom. A fucking national catastrophe is NOT priced in, from a dip that only took us back to October.

We have been to the moon, boys, and Neil Armstrong said that getting there isn't the scary part, it's coming back down to Earth that is frightening. So, nut up, and let's take this spaceship for one more ride.",,

I have never once heard the church say ""someone is not worthy of love simply for how they were born."" Or actually any members either, but obviously I don't know every single member of the church. Do you have a source for that? Or somewhere I could find more info? I have also never once felt that the church was a high demand religion or that it didn't allow for everyone to love and be loved but if that's how you chose to follow the religion when you were in it, I guess that's how it was to you.

However, I'd like to make a few clarifications if possible, and perhaps dispel a belief or two you might have. I appreciate your candor, and your willingness to have an open conversation about this.

So, first of all, UWMC was not actually my first DD... Salesforce was. You can see it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx3sbz/dd\_salesforce\_due\_diligence/ , and it was over two months ago.

Second, my very first DD on UWMC was in light of its first runup, and was found here. I did not cross post to the UWMC shareholder thread. as I wasn't aware of it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough\_with\_the\_techno\_mumbo\_jumbo\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/)

My second DD wasn't either and was posted solely to WSB (as was the accompanying YOLO): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md3080/uwmc\_follow\_through\_the\_mad\_money\_interview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md3080/uwmc_follow_through_the_mad_money_interview/) 

It wasn't until my third DD that I cross-posted for the first time in UWMC, which was a month later: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpqxbf/my\_update\_on\_uwmc\_the\_equivalent\_of\_counting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpqxbf/my_update_on_uwmc_the_equivalent_of_counting/) 

This DD is somewhere in the middle of all my DD, but i also didn't cross post it.: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n605e7/upcoming\_uwmc\_earnings\_in\_relation\_to\_ldi\_rkt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n605e7/upcoming_uwmc_earnings_in_relation_to_ldi_rkt/) 

WSB actually removed a few of my DD posts, such as this one here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzeurb/update\_on\_uwmc\_earnings\_date\_announced\_and\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzeurb/update_on_uwmc_earnings_date_announced_and_the/) 

This one here (Which i didn't want to bother you on): [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n00btl/uwmc\_a\_fundamental\_analysis\_of\_why\_this\_stock\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n00btl/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) 

This one here too: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzey12/uwmc\_the\_electric\_bugaloo\_or\_why\_the\_cleric\_cast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzey12/uwmc_the_electric_bugaloo_or_why_the_cleric_cast/) 

I could go on, but I belabor the point. I'm just going to use these as a factual basis to speak to my underlying state of mind.

1) I am speaking in the UWMC shareholder area because I am literally all in on UWMC, as   
 I stated I would be in my first or second DD. There's no other stock to talk about, because I'm not diversified. I would fucking LOVE to post about Xillinx. The ability to buy AMD at a roughly 28 P/E ratio when it's cash flow positive, and makes a large sum of net income, and is still growing a huge amount? Fuck yeah. Or GE... Fuck man, i want to talk to people about my plan to sell long dated puts on GME because of the extremely juicy premium. But I cant until i exit UWMC and diversify once more. It's simple. I'm all in. Is it strange that if i'm all in on something, that's the stock i care about? DFV posted about GME for -2- years because he was -all in- on GME. It's like asking an ape to be interested in oranges, when he only eats banana's. 

2) Furthermore, especially when WSB auto removed my DD, i'm going to post elsewhere (I don't want to force my posts where it's getting removed, because i don't want to get banned and i want to follow your ruleset). You can see the deleted posts. You can SEE that it's roughly 6-10 pages worth of research with strong citations. I spend hours on it. It's GOOD research, that is thoroughly vetted by sources like the Mortgage Bankers Association, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and official economic data. I do that, because citations are a strong way to prove that you're not pumping and dumping, or manipulating the stock. I do this as a means of showing to you, and to people who read it, that i'm not talking out of my ass, because i'm not.

3) Flowing from 2, this stock offered a bit more than 6.4% in dividends, which in light of T reducing its dividend to the low 4% range, means that this stock for a time was the highest reliable dividend stock. Especially when considering it's extremely low payout ratio. I'm just trying to state something here, which is that my recommendation of this stock is rooted in fact and not a pump and dump through manipulation. 

4) I didn't make that subreddit, nor am I a moderator for that subreddit. I do post there, but come on man, there was a lot of people hating on me here for a time because ""This stock sucks."" Much like they did for DFV. I didn't want to over impose here, by continuously posting about the ticker and getting bashed for it. One, because it's rude. Two, because it can get demoralizing. People are NOW seeing the stock favorably, much like they do GME. But like GME, UWMC got a lot of shit before their moment in the sun. I AM sorry if you felt like i've been brigading, but i'm OG on this stock man. I posted way before all that, and way before joining the UWMC subreddit. I'm one of the few people you can actually VERIFIABLY see was posting about this stock here from a little more than -2- months ago.

I understand in light of GME, you have applied a lot more scrutiny. Which is your right. And i can understand why you think I'm ""weird"" about this stock. I DO hope that this explanation clarifies and puts your mind at ease. 

In regards to the manipulation:

1) Stocktwits, CNBC, and a host of other personalities would get in trouble before I did. What I am doing is more akin to being a stock analyst, but actually being invested in the stock. Which is why I disclose my positions every time I post my DD, much like contributrs who write articles on SeekingAlpha or Morningstar. I also sauce my shit. I wasn't trying to have a go at the staff team about your ruleset, i was asking you guys to make your guidelines clearer so that I don't fall afoul of them. I'd rather abide by your guidelines, than break them, so help me do that man. Sincerely, that's what this is about.

Speaking of which, this is a literal 1 hour ago example of what i'm talking about in this recent DD: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngckdk/uwmc\_relative\_rotation/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngckdk/uwmc_relative_rotation/)

Fannypackphantom (a mod) stated this: ""Stretch these updates out to two weeks or one if major changes happen, and do not delete the posts you posted to this sub.""

However, that's not in the DD ruleset. If i hadn't read this DD i would never have known my man. That's something to think about. No one who hasn't read that DD knows that. This and the one YOLO forever on your position (even if you add to it), means that i'm stepping on toes/landmines that i'd rather not you know?

Regardless, in closing I'd like to reiterate this. I was posting about UWMC here before I ever found out about the subreddit for UWMC and was invited there because of my DD on it. I post there because I have no positions in other stocks at current, and because my DD is about the stock. I post my DD to more than one place because i put a LOT of effort and time into my due diligence and even if people don't invest in the stock, it's nice to have a talk about it. I LIKE the stock after all. I post it elsewhere, especially, when it's blocked from posting here because i'd rather SOMEONE read what i spent hours of my life creating rather than no one. At the end of the day, I see WSB as an informal investment club. Finally, before posting on UWMC, I posted on another ticket (Salesforce). 

I do really appreciate you doing what you can in regards to the bot, and i appreciate that you took time outside of your day to reply to me. Hopefully, i've eased your mind somewhat as to my ""weirdness."" I apologize if you felt like you've felt brigaded.",,

To tell me that my experience was UTTER NONSENSE? I was NEVER TAUGHT about the stones in a hat. I was never shown that. I was never taught that Brigham Young said interracial couples should be slain on the spot. I was never taught that the Book of Abraham was derived from papyrii that are actually translated to be an egyptian funeral document. I was NEVER taught that Joseph Smith married other men's wives or young teens. I was NEVER taught about the mountain meadows massacre. I was NEVER taught about 1990 temple ceremony changes. I was NEVER taught about the 1978 racist teaching changes. I was NEVER taught that Joseph Smith was a treasure seeking conman before he started his cult.

If you genuinely think that you are smarter and more compassionate than such a being, then you are simply delusional. You have to operate within the frameworks of established premises.

In the interest of being constructive, your flair rules are kind of your content guidelines for making a post with that flair. Memetron stated that you can only post 1 YOLO and then close out that yolo with a gain/loss. I added like 25k to my Yolo when I posted the update, and that update was like... I need to check but like a month or a month and a half old? Maybe if you add to your YOLO position by a certain position, and enough time has been added, it can be allowed? Think of it like someone telling the world ""I've fucking doubled the fuck down, i'm king of the hill baby, mama didn't raise no bitch!"" Otherwise, just codify what Memetron told me, because people don't know it, or whatever the mods ultimately decide.

I actually agree with what Fannypackphantom said. I think 2 weeks for an update if nothing major happens, and 1 week for if something MAJOR happens is just fine. 

More generally, there's a lot of unwritten rules that people only find out about until after they've unwittingly broken that unknown rule.

Even things like Mountain Meadows and McKonkie's ""mormon doctrine."" 

The reason why I don't argue about it is because eventually I realized never in the history of the world has a faith based decision been made because someone argued nitty gritty. Yes I can place all of these historical events in context. Yes I can denounce improper behavior. Yes I can place all of that within a logically plausible framework where nothing is contradicting. But there will never be an end to it and there is no limit to how much someone can argue twisted things. 

Thats why I came in to address just the fallacies he made regarding ""they have money therefore they're evil"" and fell down this rabbit hole. My stating that I don't want to argue nitty gritty is because it only breeds argumentative feelings and never contributes to anything constructive. It literally NEVER ends. 

You're free to say all religion is bulls***, but if you say all religion is bulls*** because rabbits are cute, then yea Imma jump all over you to call you out on your fallacy.

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

* If 410 fails look for 407.70 - 406.65 - 405 - 404.02

- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system.

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

9311,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

9315,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D.

Whether you treat this sub as a place to learn, treat it as a casino, come here as a place to see shapes and colors, a place to share wins or losses (lots and lots of losses) or a place to meme it up, it is only possible from the mods work and them weeding out all the bull shit.

9319,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nue-board-approves-upto-144402940.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAACWBuv6e3QIgwJwbEyZcMzIm66vAqeGiL87eT9covILaILC4gFtHpmnTaiEHNE9OPGnnneWieYG1U74csNNaKjKXw4cBpfsBJ\_ieRDdSq0qf12RjsZSebw\_XIQZFZVEmDoE6zpM6XPkdt3ntlkWaDhbrNxIpzGe4hzzV8kcUowPy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nue-board-approves-upto-144402940.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACWBuv6e3QIgwJwbEyZcMzIm66vAqeGiL87eT9covILaILC4gFtHpmnTaiEHNE9OPGnnneWieYG1U74csNNaKjKXw4cBpfsBJ_ieRDdSq0qf12RjsZSebw_XIQZFZVEmDoE6zpM6XPkdt3ntlkWaDhbrNxIpzGe4hzzV8kcUowPy)

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c.",ng50po,GLD and GOLD. Useless crap but it's all about the narrative.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

[BOA is there huh?  Citadel too? WOW. What a coincidence. What a surprise after Hindenburg's report. ](https://preview.redd.it/2sccbu1jk3071.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=62622eee1cb5100dc6f30dd6b7aa408f812055a7)

&#x200B;

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything.

&#x200B;

Anyways, unfortunately, we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week, but we should still be BULLISH in CLOV even after all this manipulation. May 21 calls had high volume, but MM's want to make their money, and they will never allow for a run.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

9556,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

9560,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nue-board-approves-upto-144402940.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAACWBuv6e3QIgwJwbEyZcMzIm66vAqeGiL87eT9covILaILC4gFtHpmnTaiEHNE9OPGnnneWieYG1U74csNNaKjKXw4cBpfsBJ\_ieRDdSq0qf12RjsZSebw\_XIQZFZVEmDoE6zpM6XPkdt3ntlkWaDhbrNxIpzGe4hzzV8kcUowPy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nue-board-approves-upto-144402940.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACWBuv6e3QIgwJwbEyZcMzIm66vAqeGiL87eT9covILaILC4gFtHpmnTaiEHNE9OPGnnneWieYG1U74csNNaKjKXw4cBpfsBJ_ieRDdSq0qf12RjsZSebw_XIQZFZVEmDoE6zpM6XPkdt3ntlkWaDhbrNxIpzGe4hzzV8kcUowPy)

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

For example, I had a question about the situation in Israel that I wanted to direct at my fellow german people. There arent many german subs you could ask this question in. I posted it in the only sub I know this topic would fit into and used the ‚ÄûQuestion / Discussion‚Äú flair. It was a well written and long post with an objective question, not really taking sides. It was deleted because of ‚Äûlow-quality‚Äú. Even some commenters said, they didnt understand why this was supposed to be low quality.
The moderator actually answered to it and moved the goalpost, saying it was because there are news articles about it and I was only allowed to write about the topic there. There were 3 news articles about it, the youngest one 6 hours old with hundreds of comments. Neither the news articles, nor any of the comments were even remotely going into the direction of my question. I intentionally didnt write it there, because an article with hundreds of comments is basically dead when it comes to new comments, because no one scrolls down that far. As expected, when I posted it there, because the moderator said so, no one answered.
So basically he made it impossible to discuss this topic on the sub with my countrymen, as long as im not lucky enough to spot an article about this within the first 30 minutes of its creation.
The mod said ‚ÄûWhat if everybody makes a post about it?‚Äú, Ignoring the fact no one yet did and that every wednesday the sub is flooded with individual ‚ÄûIts Wednesday my dudes‚Äú-Frog-Memes ,and they dont give a shit at all.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

The first thing that I noticed is that large spikes don't occur isolated

Another thing that I noticed was that the large spikes were only attributed to changes from medium to high regimes.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c.",ng50po,GLD and GOLD. Useless crap but it's all about the narrative.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

&#x200B;

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything.

&#x200B;

Anyways, unfortunately, we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week, but we should still be BULLISH in CLOV even after all this manipulation. May 21 calls had high volume, but MM's want to make their money, and they will never allow for a run.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.
