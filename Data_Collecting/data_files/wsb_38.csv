lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this
month increasing his position by 21%.

It's not a sex convention, but it is an environment where a lot of people go to try to meet potential romantic/sexual partners. Obviously not everyone is looking for sex, but it's definitely a normal thing to meet someone at a bar and hook up.

Yes there are social cues, but they are not always obvious. You can't always tell if the girl across the dark/loud bar is smiling at you or just smiling, and sometimes there just isn't an opportunity for eye contact until the person is approached. So people approach and ask to get an actual answer, not a facial expression that they have to interpret.

I can see why being propositioned by someone you're not interested in can be uncomfortable, but I think it's still acceptable in the right context.

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

In the 90's, interest rates for mortgage were at about 10%+.  Then later in the 90's, it subsided to around 7%.

* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))  


Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

Then sprinkle in any of their ceos being able to match their sales output with realized capital gains and interest fees from lending.... Enough of this sundial has poor fundamentals shit.

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use. This first stage booster (the bottom part of the üöÄ that you usually see falling back to earth right before they cut to the star of the movie floating in zero g... maybe spinning a toy or something) which costs $40MM comes back down... land safely AND RELIABLY ... some barge floating in the ocean... doesn't matter, point is it works. And it means that SpaceX can launch missions to orbit for the cost of rocket fuel, no need to go buy a $40MM booster, they can just use the one the Airforce bought for a single use mission (our tax dollars hard at work smh).  
  
StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of üõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏è. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few üõ∞Ô∏è the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of üõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏è) has 16 HUNDRED üõ∞Ô∏è and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable (I mean... they are sending hundreds a month at this point and on their way to having tens of thousands) these things are making it off of üåé like crazy.  
  
Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on üåé for $500 down and $100 a month. The service is SOOOO much better and over the course of a year cheaper than the competition that VSAT is gonna do the second half of a üöÄ flight. They are up there now.... and about to come plummeting toward bankruptcy. Sometime in the next few earnings reports something BAD is gonna pop up in VSAT's numbers. They will suddenly start hemorrhaging customers, first the residential ones as tens of thousands of Beta users get on StarLink and then the big corporate ones as the constellation gets robust enough to handle inflight WiFi for ALL of the ‚úàÔ∏è .",,

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

5903,5903,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

3322,3322,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

2771,2771,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

The consensus on this forum is the hedges have shorted more shares than actually exist(naked shorts). Therefore they cannot return the shares because they don't exist. When we continue to hold they will get margin called and cause an infinity (forever) squeeze. Price will raise until all shorts are satisfied. Ape hold banana until banana make ape happy.

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

3349,3349,,2021-05-26 20:05:38,t3_nlq624,,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas transmission network with \~70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, 659 bcf of storage capacity, and \~1200 miles of NGL. The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

After the first GME fiasco where I made $6k (but then I paper hands) my new strategy is

Never sell anything unless
1. If I hate the stock, no returns, etc. Hold until I break even.
2. If I hate the stock, but a little return, hold until I've made 25%
3. Hold stocks I'm indifferent to until I've cleared 50% profit, then sell enough to cover my initial investment and keep the rest
4. Stocks that I'm making crazy profit: hold until I've reached 1000%, sell 10% to cover initial investment, try to diamond hands as long as possible.

I've got a limit sell for AMC of 25 (of my 50) to sell at 21.70, and another for the rest at $32.55 (for 1500%).

1362,1362,,2021-05-26 20:05:38,t3_nlq624,,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

This would constitute a BUY.

A sell would be if stock is currently at 20.05 and I want to make sure I sell mine right now (but don't want to use market sale) I would put in 20.00.     That way my trade is executed faster.  That would be a Sell.

EDIT: short TLDR said beutifully by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.

9737,9737,gzklkhn,2021-05-26 22:48:50,t1_gzklkhn,t1_gzkjmkt,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you bought the $9 strike price 6/18 UWMC call. Right now it‚Äôs out of the money so the intrinsic value is -0.40 or so. Once UWMC reaches $9.35, the intrinsic value of your call would be worth 0.0 and any stock price above that is that difference x 100 to your pocket.

However, there are many factors that effect the extrinsic value of your call, namely the greeks delta (chance of reaching strike price), vega (implied volatility), and theta (time left til expiration). I‚Äôm oversimplifying the greeks but just know that volatility in the underlying stock increases option value, as does time. If the stock price goes up so does delta. As your call gets close to expiration, you lose time and thus lose theta, they call this theta decay. 

Anyway, since we‚Äôre pretty close to 6/18, and since your call was cheap, you probably want to gamble and hope there‚Äôs a pump and pseudo squeeze to bring the price to maybe $10+, then you can sell your option for .65+ and maybe even easily 2x your call. With a $9 strike price, with the way things are going I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you sold for 1.05, a 3x. 

So the stock moves up less than $2 and I 3x my investment? Yes, that‚Äôs why wallstreetbetters are addicted to options and also lose money just as fast. I actually had over a 6x on UWMC about 2 weeks ago, buying $10 6/18s for 0.10 and selling for 0.63.",,

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

He recently made a number of leadership changes under the strategic direction set by activist investor Ryan Cohen, who is leading his transition to e-commerce to compete with large retailers.  
Former CFO Jim Bell and chief client officer Frank Hamlin were among the senior executives who left this year, and CEO George Sherman is expected to leave on July 31 or when a successor is appointed. Former Amazon Web Services engineering manager Matt Francis was appointed to his newly created position of chief technology officer in February.

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

3320,3320,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

Using my tried and true method I can guarantee a 15x or MORE return for you in 10 trading days or less!

Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

In the 90's, interest rates for mortgage were at about 10%+.  Then later in the 90's, it subsided to around 7%.

Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas transmission network with \~70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, 659 bcf of storage capacity, and \~1200 miles of NGL. The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

In the 90's, interest rates for mortgage were at about 10%+.  Then later in the 90's, it subsided to around 7%.

Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

Has to be shopify right? Why hasn't it already happened? Maybe shopify doesn't want to sell? But if that is the case, hostile t/o is in cards like what happened with ebay / paypal split? Ebay didn't want to split ebay and paypal so Carl Ican forced their hand

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

5901,5901,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this
month increasing his position by 21%.

Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.

Usually, when a stock's price is high, people buy puts to hedge against the possibility of the stock price to drop. So say you buy a GME put for a strike price of $200 expiring next Friday. That means whoever sold you the put is required to buy GME shares from you for $200 at any point from now until next Friday. If GME's share price remains above $200, then the put you bought is worthless because it wouldn't make sense for you to exercise it. However, if GME's share price drops to, say, $170 by next Friday, you can exercise your put and sell your shares for $200. There are a number of variables and factors that determine the price of the put option, so it may not always be profitable even if the strike price is higher than the share price. It's basically like paying for an insurance policy. If you're new to options though, you should definitely understand what they're about before buying any. It's very, VERY easy to lose money on options.",,

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

1. GME would not have pivoted nor changed management. 2. Probably wouldve been crushed by the short until bankruptcy due to its deteriorating and obsolete business model. 

WSB woke the company up and now it finally seems like GME might be able to survive and grow due to it. However, I would not fault your analysis because it does have grounds. I personally believe that the new management overall could turn the business around especially with all the public support they are still receiving.

They mostly believe that there are large outstanding short positions on their chosen ticker (doesn't matter which one, the dogma is inevitably the same). You can't see them because there is a massive conspiracy to hide them. They believe the conspiracy is so powerful that it literally controls the price of the stock with pinpoint precision. Despite this if *everyone* buys shares they can trigger a short squeeze because despite not having needed to cover for over four months apparently the vast all-powerful conspiracy will still need to cover any moment now for reasons I don't understand.

It's illogical, and they routinely parrot price targets that would put their stock at a market cap multiple orders of magnitude greater than there exists money on Earth, but that's fine because they don't know what those stock words mean anyway.",,

Why did it take them two months to identify it after it got out? Why didnt they have all that research they were supposedly doing already on hand? 

If it was in their lab, already having been studied, already having been sequenced, then they would have been able to quickly identify what the mystery pneumonia was that was killing people in Wuhan. 

Also, having all that great research already done that you mentioned, China would have had an incredible headstart in developing a vaccine.
