So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

I would like to be to just close this out the loan personally, on my schedule.",Margin Newbie: How to pay back margin loan?,,

5,2021-04-28 14:20:12,t3_n0fv4o,n0fv4o,RobinHood,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

tl;dr: Secure your email account today!","Hey, you with the weak email password, fix that!",,

12,2021-04-28 19:41:06,t3_n0mz1n,n0mz1n,RobinHood,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part— Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won’t. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I’m tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren’t required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone’s advice works and I get my money back, I’d be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that’s legal.

I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

Anyway, I decided to ""just do it""  about 3 weeks ago and started with $500 on Robinhood. I have 4 free stocks so far and got 3.11 GE, 0.0298 AMZN, 2 BUZZ, 1 NIO, and 266 DOGE.

63,2021-05-09 13:47:04,t3_n8el75,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",,

One of these days there WON’T be a retreat and the option writers will feel like they eat a laced banana😳. Plus, you always have the feeling that the wrong players hold the option. They are likely to exercise even when slightly OTM. Catch-22 between trying to become relevant with owning enough shares, to being paranoid about giving the Hedgies any help. It seems to me that every time they do exercise someone’s shares, the cost makes it a negative play long run? Every negative play has to be a positive play somewhere else. It truly is a zero sum game other than the minuscule price paid for option contracts. Someone wins 1,000, someone loses 1,000.

164,2021-05-19 00:06:43,t1_gymw2bz,,RobinHood,"I'll break it down.  The simplified ""Drunk History"" version of what OP is talking about.  Yeah - I'm drunk.  

OP owns 100 shares of AMC.  His cost basis (not necessarily what he paid to buy them, but what they essentially cost him now after fiddling with selling options) is $10.30 a share (he essentially paid $1030 for 100 shares of AMC). 

He sold a contract saying he would sell someone his 100 shares for $13 each if on 5/28 AMC was trading at or above $13 a share.  Looks like he got paid around $79 for this contract. 

If on 5/28 AMC is above $13, he'll sell his 100 shares for $13 each (get paid $1300, he paid essentially $1030 (looks like the contract he sold got him $79), so he'll make $270 profit).  If AMC is at $50 on 5/28 (or really anything above $13), too bad for OP, he's gonna sell them for $13.

If AMC is below 13 on 5/28, he keeps the shares and makes the $79 he got for selling the contract.

OP wants to possibly buy back the contract (which now cost $225 - so he'll be down $146), but he'll have his shares to do what he wants with now that are worth $1500 with AMC at $15 (worth $200 more than at $13, but OP has to pay $146 for that now). As long as that contract is open, he doesn't really own those shares anymore. There's still 10 days until they expire, AMC could still end up below $13, or at $20 for all we know. So...OP doesn't know what to do.  

""Rolling"" is buying back his contract and selling yet another, further away in time contract to offset the cost of buying back the original one (could sell a contract to sell AMC at $15 in a month or so and break even possibly).  But, then he's still on the hook for this contract. This part is really where OP is seeking help.  To roll or not, and how far to roll (what date), as well as what strike ($13, $15, etc) to roll to.

If AMC sat still or dropped since he sold the contract, OP would have made money or have the consolation that at least he made an extra $79 (8% return on investment in a short time is good $). But...by selling the contract, he also limits his upside if AMC goes up, and has to gamble more (or at least reduce his earnings vs. a buy and hold strategy) on what will happen now.  The stock jumped up, so now he's wishing he still had control of his shares, and want's to know the best way to handle this situation.

TLDR: don't sell Covered Calls at a price you wouldn't be happy to sell your shares.  FOMO and shoulda, coulda, woulda aren't good for investment growth.",,gymw2bz,t1_gylqf7y

&#x200B;

I take out margin (2.5% interest) for $150k

&#x200B;

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

&#x200B;

The margin $150k is put into a mixo of:

 1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time

2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

&#x200B;

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

&#x200B;

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

  
I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

&#x200B;

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

A) Add exposure - Buy another call option if you think it will go higher to mitigate some losses. 
B) Wait it out if you think AMC will take a shit before the 28th.

Either way AMC is at a critical point on its daily chart and sitting in an area of Supply. By the end of this week you'll know if it will be heading towards $20 or $9.

I was a lucky guy in life but my mom who had a decent life / job (worked for the U.S. Embassy) but lived outside her means so it’s like if we were constantly in debt in my household growing up.  (Guess that’s why I got into finance huh ?)   That’s why for me personally when I started with a little over $900 I got used to making a few hundred bucks a month constantly than the home run hit that makes you $10,000 YOLO Call.  Trust me it may seem slow when you start “eh $90 bucks a week whatever” at least it’s drinking money or a date money, but as your capital builds; later you basically can live rent/mortgage free…)

Basically you are buying a put (gives you the right but not the obligation to own 100 Amazon shares, so basically a derivative) and you are selling a put.  This is basically a Credit Spread.  

Check out OptionsProfitCalculator.com for the informational demo below. 

That way you can visualize you profits / losses on a contract.  

So let’s take AMZN which at some point was 3200 today.  On the website click credit spread and put in the ticker and get the price. 

Click on Buy and I would get comfortable with a 2 or 3 week out until you are comfortable.  So click on “Select Option” and pick lets say May 28th.  Buy the $3100 PUT (on the right side) and then when it comes to Write (or selling) pick the $3105 for May 28th as well.  

When I did it around 11:20 AM EST (since prices and volatility constantly move our numbers might be slightly off when you read this) I was getting a $94 Credit for a collateral of $500.  That’s roughly a 18% return in two weeks, easy living don’t care about the market I just care about one stock and one number.  

IF Amazon goes below $3105 you lose it all basically, the credit and deposit BUT anytime you want you can “close” the contract so you can control how much you want to ride out or not.  Remember if Amazon keeps dropping today and until the 28th BUT it moves up on that Friday to $3156 or any random number above your $3105 you can keep ALL of the $94.  I personally just cash out anywhere from 60%-90% ($56.4-$84.6 in that example).  The way I see it, I rather close out and check charts when to reopen another, could be immediately or I’m waiting for a better window.

This was just a quick example not talking about the Greeks and best prices to maximize your Credit.  I hope all this does is at least make you curious about other ways to make money on the stock market.  

There is the wheel option when you are more comfortable with options and various forms of spreads in general for different situations.  As someone said to me awhile ago “son if you can’t make money when the market is going down you got more to learn.”  

Good luck and wish you more success than I ever had.",,gypi8h9,t1_gye6vlt

255,2021-05-19 20:36:46,t1_gyqp41y,,RobinHood,"The problem with selling covered calls on volatile meme stocks is that you need to put a large portion of your capital into shares of volatile meme stocks.

Like what happens when one of these volatile meme stocks does a volatility and now you're either looking at 'losing' a fuck ton of money because you capped your gains at literally $100, or it takes a sudden shit and now your shares are down heavily, where you're either forced to ride it out or purchase your call back at higher IV (which will still likely be less, but considering you were getting peanuts to begin with). 

The inherent contradiction is that you're purchasing volatile stocks in the hope that they don't act volatile. You're trying to get around that by reducing the length of the contract but that just drastically decreases your premium. It's a great illustration of ""options are priced efficiently"" though, and a great recipe for getting into a losing spiral or simply getting piss poor return on your capital.

That's the problem with these ""works until it doesn't"" strats. You convince yourself you're a genius on the money train because 9/10 times you are, but that 10th time will wipe you out. Pennies and steam rollers and all that.

As an aside, I've noticed this weird disease in these new investor forums where people put way too much emphasis on things that return cash while ignoring things like opportunity cost or alpha. You're talking about dividends and weekly returns while seemingly ignoring the idea of just putting that $16k of GME into in a company that might actually be worth something in the future.",,gyqp41y,t3_nfy4ly

From a finance perspective, there should be no difference in the value of the equity in the company (i.e., the market cap + equity claims in the business like the cash on balance sheet) from changing the number of shares outstanding. Investors should always have the same amount of value despite changes in the capital structure. This is a lot so lmk if you have question",,gyv2r1w,t1_gyv2ctq

Meaning, while shares might change in number, market cap and price are the only 2 correlated variables. Think of it as market cap is a whole pie, and price is just the way you measure that pie if you split it into an arbitrary number of “slices” (i.e., shares). So, if you have a market cap of $10MM and it goes up to $20MM, assuming a constant 10 shares (so $1MM per share) your price per share *must* have increased 100% (to $2MM per share). Now, some will say, what if the number of shares changes? Theoretically, then the price changes, but not the market cap. So if those $20MM are now split into 20 shares, the share price goes back to $1MM (decreases 50%), but because 2 new shares = 1 old share, market cap doesn’t change.",,gyv2ctq,t3_nh6j0a

The basic calculation of market cap (not including treasury shares or other dilution from warrants/convertible bonds) is share price x number of shares outstanding. The “equity claims” in a business is just another way of referring to shares in a company. Your share IS the equity claim (or risk dual claim), which means you have a partial claim to the equity in the company after all debts are retired (if any remains). Cash on the balance sheet is not an “equity claim”, so I’m not sure what you are getting at.

I would disagree with you.

371,2021-05-21 06:22:16,t1_gywz99u,,RobinHood,"It’s an equation. `Market cap = share price * shares outstanding` and `share price = market cap / shares outstanding`. Shares are fractions of ownership of a company, and if you are buying a fraction of something you ought to know what that something is worth in order to determine if the price is fair. Market cap tells you what the value of all the shares added up are, or in other words what it would cost to buy the entire company at that share price, so if you want to see if it’s valued correctly you compare market cap to whatever you think the company is worth. That could be book value (value of all its assets), the ratio between price and earnings (P/E), or whatever. Share price by itself without the number of shares outstanding is kind of useless when judging value.

Not that it hasn’t stopped idiots from valuing companies solely off their share price as if a company with $8 shares indicates undervaluation and higher growth potential than a company with $800 shares. Saw this all the time when AMD was $8 and people kept saying it was easier to imagine it would reach $15 than $65 NVDA reaching $100. Goes hand-in-hand with feeling like you own more stuff when you own more shares as if shares were intrinsically equal on some level and not just an arbitrary minimum slice size (fractionals notwithstanding).

That said there are benefits to lower share prices, namely liquidity due to affordability and smaller options contracts dollarwise (exchange traded options are almost always for 100 shares each regardless of what each share costs or how big a slice of the pie it represents). For that reason companies do stock splits. Apple has done several, which is why they’re around $127 while Amazon is at $3250 despite Apple being worth 30% more. On the opposite end BRK/A has famously avoided splits precisely to limit liquidity and gatekeep their shareholders and thus have a mere 1.52 million shares outstanding for a company valued at $656.78 _billion_.",,gywz99u,t1_gywp4w5

This is my second post on this subreddit. In my first post I needed help getting a call option order for VOD filled. I had trouble because I didn't understand bid-ask spread and I received a lot of feedback.

This post is about two F call options I bought at $23 and $24 on 5/20. I sold them both today at $47 apiece. Can I get a little help understanding profit? At first glance it looks like I've gained $47. 

Is it that simple? I know calculating profits can be a little complicated when it comes to options. Still trying to learn, and I also wanted to post about my success somewhere. Thanks for any input!",Ford Call Option Trade Profit Calculation Help,,

410,2021-05-21 17:22:29,t3_nhxwlf,nhxwlf,RobinHood,"Heya, got a quick question that I just can't seem to find the answer to.

&#x200B;

Say the following happened:

5/1 Buy 1 XYZ @ 340$

5/2 Buy 1 XYZ @ 240$

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$ (sold two shares, split to two transactions for simplicity)

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$

&#x200B;

This would be a pretty substantial loss, however, I'm not sure how to calculate the allowed capital gains/losses for my own books.  Certainly I'd like for the full 500$ in losses to be deductible, however, I don't know how/if that would work out given wash rules.

Would neither be deductible (since for both purchases, there was another purchase within ±30 days of the sale of the same XYZ)?  Or would one be disallowed (and the other one's basis adjusted (does Robinhood even support this?))?

&#x200B;

Sorry if I'm overthinking this – this is my first time actually trying to comprehend the mile-long 1099-B I get from Robinhood and calculate my own books (so whatever TurboTax says I owe won't kill me).",Wash sale clarification (for when stocks are held <30 days),,

416,2021-05-21 18:27:48,t1_gyyzk6r,,RobinHood,"Wash sale losses are not ""disallowed"" or ""lost"" forever. It is carried forward until you exit the position entirely. Back in the day, people would sell to realize their paper losses in Dec...deduct these losses against their gains for the year...and rebuy back into the same position in Jan of the next year. The whole point of wash sale is to prevent people from claiming the same loss in one year and also the next year.

All you have to do is keep track of your total cost basis and total proceeds. Tally them at the end of the year. The only thing to be mindful of is selling any position for a loss in Dec to not rebuy the same position in Jan (wait at least 30 days). 

For your example, all 500$ is deductible on the last sale. If you rebuy XYZ on 5/30 (which is within 30 days), then that 500$ loss is carried forward to that position. You cannot deduct the 500$ loss from 5/18 unless you exit your new 5/30 position.

If you wait 30 days to rebuy XYZ (say on 6/18)...the 6/18 position counts as a new trade. Your 500$ loss from 5/18 is not carried forward and is freely deductible irregardless of what you do with your 6/18 position.",,gyyzk6r,t3_nhxwlf

503,2021-05-23 16:36:00,t3_njbel0,njbel0,RobinHood,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

https://preview.redd.it/clrv2hqw9w071.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f5e54ef10dcb11fb4f76f38a1db1880c2643ec

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/qq3k3p86aw071.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff53655224fd0e749f47a6cf5c92996e56b04ae

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",The Weekly DD - IPOE/SoFi: Powering the Future (FinTech),,

My main question is about taxes. Ive never seen a tax form in my life, but people always say when buying stocks/investing, make sure to analyze the tax you would have to pay when you cash it and such.

But my question is like...how does the government know anything about our investing/stocks? Like if I just put 100$ into Robinhood, bought some random stock, and it goes up to like 105 or something. Then cash it out and put it into my bank account. How exactly do they know anything about it? Only reason I ask is because if I hypothetically invested into like 10 stocks.....Im not sure if I would be good at keeping track with what amount was invested when and what tax rate or something.

Here's what have...

CUB 75c 10/15 (6x100)

CUB 75c 12/17 (1x100)

I looked into CUB (not well enough) and read the news of their acquisition but I did not know if/when they would be delisted. They were still posting news of business as usual (govt contracts, etc) and these calls were cheap+near ATM so I figured I would go for it. (Feel free to roast me on this poor decision with a near 0% IV)

Am I entitled to shares of this delisted stock if I choose to exercise? Or would it be a wash at $75 since that was the acquisition stock (and likely buyback) price?

611,2021-05-25 16:39:52,t1_gzeqex5,,RobinHood,"Main tax implications (as far as i know about US tax) to consider with investments are about the timing of when you buy/sell. If you sell an investment after less than a year of buying it, you’ll have to pay higher taxes on your gains than if you held it for more than a year. Less than a year means you’ll pay the tax rate of your ordinary income, maybe 20 something %. If you hold it for more than a year, your gains will be taxed at the capital gains tax rate, probably 15%. Losses will reduce your gains to zero before reducing any of your ordinary gains, but only up to 3k of losses per year, the remainder being carried forward into the future. Losses may not be allowed if you sell and rebuy an investment without enough time passing (look up wash sale rules). If you have bought multiple of the same investment but at different times, some of which were bought less than a year before you sold and some more than a year, i believe the IRS looks at it as though you sold your oldest shares first when deciding whether it was a short term or long term investment. If you gain a lot from investing, be sure you have enough cash on hand when you file your taxes so that you will have enough to pay the tax on your gains since theres no one withholding your taxes for you like employers do.

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

I am anticipating it will rise to $56 or higher by 5/21 and opted to go with the following PUT CREDIT spread as follows: 

EBAY
currently $55.99
sell - 14th May - $56.00 - Put 1x100 -$1.16 - $116.00
buy -14th May - $53.00 - Put 1x100 - $0.26 - $-26.00
Total	$90.00 credit

My profit matrix looks like this (link to Options Profit Calculator):

$90 is my maximum profit for this option trade which is fine for me.

Can I get some feedback if this is the best spread option to apply? (as opposed to a CALL CREDIT spread, iron condor or any other option programs). Are these the optimal expiration dates and strike values to maximize my profit with as little risk as possible?

I have been trying to learn about investing, stocks, crypto etc for a few months now by reading and watching YouTube videos. The truth is I'm still pretty overwhelmed and confused by it all. It also doesn't help that I hate numbers lol

Anyway, I decided to ""just do it""  about 3 weeks ago and started with $500 on Robinhood. I have 4 free stocks so far and got 3.11 GE, 0.0298 AMZN, 2 BUZZ, 1 NIO, and 266 DOGE. I definitely don't know what I am doing but I want to invest more. $500 more or maybe 1k. I know that I want VTI or VOO also.

I know and understand that most people on here are not financial advisors and I know that it is up to me to do my own research BUT I am coming to you all anyway to ask for your help/advice. People are a wealth of information on this app. 

So if you were me, a beginner, with $1000 to invest today, what would you do? Thank you all in advance and I welcome any questions you may have.

EDIT: Wow!!! Thank you all for your responses and information. I've learned a lot of new terminology that I hadn't come across previously, so I am going to look into those as well.

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago?

657,2021-05-09 13:47:04,t3_n8el75,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",,

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

The margin $150k is put into a mixo of:

 1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time

2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

  
I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

Yes, if you update, you'll be SOL until they release a fixed beta version. If you do not have this broken beta version yet, disable automatic updates and do not manually update the app (yet).

Better yet, just downgrade to the stable version. Leave the beta program in My apps & Games => Beta => Robinhood and hit 'Leave' under ""You're a beta tester.""

706,2021-05-21 16:17:51,t3_nhwea4,nhwea4,RobinHood,"Hello /rRobinHood,

This is my second post on this subreddit. In my first post I needed help getting a call option order for VOD filled. I had trouble because I didn't understand bid-ask spread and I received a lot of feedback.

This post is about two F call options I bought at $23 and $24 on 5/20. I sold them both today at $47 apiece. Can I get a little help understanding profit? At first glance it looks like I've gained $47. 

Is it that simple? I know calculating profits can be a little complicated when it comes to options. Still trying to learn, and I also wanted to post about my success somewhere. Thanks for any input!",Ford Call Option Trade Profit Calculation Help,,
707,2021-05-21 17:22:29,t3_nhxwlf,nhxwlf,RobinHood,"Heya, got a quick question that I just can't seem to find the answer to.

&#x200B;

Say the following happened:

5/1 Buy 1 XYZ @ 340$

5/2 Buy 1 XYZ @ 240$

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$ (sold two shares, split to two transactions for simplicity)

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$

&#x200B;

This would be a pretty substantial loss, however, I'm not sure how to calculate the allowed capital gains/losses for my own books.  Certainly I'd like for the full 500$ in losses to be deductible, however, I don't know how/if that would work out given wash rules.

Would neither be deductible (since for both purchases, there was another purchase within ±30 days of the sale of the same XYZ)?  Or would one be disallowed (and the other one's basis adjusted (does Robinhood even support this?))?

&#x200B;

Sorry if I'm overthinking this – this is my first time actually trying to comprehend the mile-long 1099-B I get from Robinhood and calculate my own books (so whatever TurboTax says I owe won't kill me).",Wash sale clarification (for when stocks are held <30 days),,
708,2021-05-22 00:46:04,t3_ni72vc,ni72vc,RobinHood,"Wash sale rule? If I buy let’s say 1 bit coin at 30,000 dollars and it goes down to let’s say 25,00 dollars I then sell if for a loss of 5,000. It continues to go down and I buy it right back let’s say 2 minutes later for 20,000 then it goes back up to 30,000 and I sell it. For a profit of 10,000 dollars. Does the 5k that previously loss a wash? Do I pay tax on the 10,000 I just made or do I pays tax on the 10,000 profit minus my previous loss of 5000. Which would be 5000. And how would this be allowed on the 1099b that Robin Hood has on Cryptos. I know it’s like that for stocks. And I’m asking from those whom have used Robin Hood for crypto that have been in this situation being that they do FIFO rule this can eat into gains of it goes lower in price and I want to trade frequently thanks a lot!",Crypto Taxes Wash Sale RH,,

This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

https://preview.redd.it/clrv2hqw9w071.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f5e54ef10dcb11fb4f76f38a1db1880c2643ec

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/qq3k3p86aw071.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff53655224fd0e749f47a6cf5c92996e56b04ae

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",The Weekly DD - IPOE/SoFi: Powering the Future (FinTech),,

Here's what have...

CUB 75c 10/15 (6x100)

CUB 75c 12/17 (1x100)

I looked into CUB (not well enough) and read the news of their acquisition but I did not know if/when they would be delisted. They were still posting news of business as usual (govt contracts, etc) and these calls were cheap+near ATM so I figured I would go for it. (Feel free to roast me on this poor decision with a near 0% IV)

Am I entitled to shares of this delisted stock if I choose to exercise? Or would it be a wash at $75 since that was the acquisition stock (and likely buyback) price? Did I just burn these premiums on worthless calls for no reason? (Leaning towards yes with a lesson learned)...",Long Term Call Options on CUB (delisted today). What are my options?,,
803,2021-05-25 15:09:52,t1_gzedvwk,,RobinHood,"Complete noob to life/investing/stocks/taxes everything basically.

My main question is about taxes. Ive never seen a tax form in my life, but people always say when buying stocks/investing, make sure to analyze the tax you would have to pay when you cash it and such.

But my question is like...how does the government know anything about our investing/stocks? Like if I just put 100$ into Robinhood, bought some random stock, and it goes up to like 105 or something. Then cash it out and put it into my bank account. How exactly do they know anything about it? Only reason I ask is because if I hypothetically invested into like 10 stocks.....Im not sure if I would be good at keeping track with what amount was invested when and what tax rate or something.


Basically Im just trying to find out the fool proof way of not royally screwing myself with the IRS, since Ive never done a tax form since my parents always took care of this stuff",,gzedvwk,t3_nkm13u

807,2021-05-25 16:08:51,t1_gzem3hk,,RobinHood,"You may be overthinking this. The Option Contract will remain enforceable regardless of listing status.

Maybe I missed something.. Are you saying your broker is removing from their platform entirely? 

Otherwise the Option would behave exactly the same, listed or not. 



(Please Don't flame me if this next part is below yiu knowledge level..)  If you bought the Call, and the price is above the Strike Price of the Call, Its In the Money, so it would make economic sense to execute it, or at least Sell off the option to recoup your premium and hopefully profit.

If the price is below the Call Strike Price by the execution date, it's worthless.",,gzem3hk,t3_nkry9g

811,2021-05-25 16:39:52,t1_gzeqex5,,RobinHood,"Main tax implications (as far as i know about US tax) to consider with investments are about the timing of when you buy/sell. If you sell an investment after less than a year of buying it, you’ll have to pay higher taxes on your gains than if you held it for more than a year. Less than a year means you’ll pay the tax rate of your ordinary income, maybe 20 something %. If you hold it for more than a year, your gains will be taxed at the capital gains tax rate, probably 15%. Losses will reduce your gains to zero before reducing any of your ordinary gains, but only up to 3k of losses per year, the remainder being carried forward into the future. Losses may not be allowed if you sell and rebuy an investment without enough time passing (look up wash sale rules). If you have bought multiple of the same investment but at different times, some of which were bought less than a year before you sold and some more than a year, i believe the IRS looks at it as though you sold your oldest shares first when deciding whether it was a short term or long term investment. If you gain a lot from investing, be sure you have enough cash on hand when you file your taxes so that you will have enough to pay the tax on your gains since theres no one withholding your taxes for you like employers do. This is all off the top of my head, so feel free to google this stuff to confirm",,gzeqex5,t1_gzeehp5
812,2021-05-25 17:06:07,t1_gzeu2qq,,RobinHood,"And since strikes are $75.00 I think the contracts are worthless. OP: what you were buying was the possibility that a new acquisition offer comes in at >$75. It didn't happen this time, but it happens sometimes.",,gzeu2qq,t1_gzem4m0
813,2021-05-25 17:25:44,t1_gzewte3,,RobinHood,"At first I thought it was just Robinhood. But I checked a few others and they all say its been delisted from NYSE. 



Breakeven is ~75.05 on both dates. Stock is at 75.01 

If it's delisted, I dont know what kind of market there would be for both growth and/or selling the option contract if it does grow (why would it?)

So I think I'm going to end up eating the premiums entirely. Part of me feels like, why would RH allow people to sell calls on a seemingly impossible outcome. But that's probably sour grapes.",,gzewte3,t1_gzem3hk
814,2021-05-25 17:30:26,t1_gzexgo6,,RobinHood,"CUB received offers from an American company for $75 per share and a Taiwanese company for $78 per share. I guess they went with the former. 

If it's delisted, Im assuming there is no chance it will grow or they will buy back all shares at $75 before it has a chance to or is relisted under another name. Idk...",,gzexgo6,t1_gzeu2qq

I stopped reading here. You're moving the mark. You think the mark is the 'current price' because you think that's a thing rather than understanding that the bid and ask are different prices and you're looking at the mark which is the midpoint between the best bid and ask prices. When you place your order at the mark, you become the best bid and the mark becomes the midpoint between your bid and the outstanding ask. The mark will always be higher than the best bid and lower than the best ask. That's how math works.",,gzirdvw,t3_nliruk

-----

I'm trying to buy a little over 2 grand in $22.5 IPOE Calls, expiring Jan 21, 2022. Before I started recording, the option was selling for $2.51.

However, after I put in an order to buy 9 options (at $2.56 each), the price jumped up to $2.60.

Confused, I cancelled the order and started recording.

0:02: After a cancelled order, the option price went back down to $2.52

0:19: I resubmitted my 9 x $2.56, expecting it to clear (at $.04 above ask)

0:22: As soon as the order is placed, the price jumps back up to $2.61, making my $.04 above the ask $.05 below

0:33: I wait 10 seconds and cancel that order

0:34: The second my cancellation goes through, the price goes back down to 2:52

0:43: I resubmit 9 x $2.56

0:45: My order is placed and the option price jumps to $2.61 again

1:10: I want 25 seconds and recancel my order. Again.

1:11: As soon as the cancellation goes through, the price drops back down to $2.52

1:15: Maybe it's a tech thing. I refresh Chrome.

1:28: This time I try 9 x $2.55. One cent less.

1:29: Order placed, price goes up to $2.60. *Also one cent less*.

1:46: Cancel again. Price goes back down to $2.52 again.

1:59: This time I try 8 x $2.65.

2:06: Don't even get to see ""Placed."" It is immediately filled *and the option price doesn't move an inch*

2:12: Try refreshing Chrome again. Still $2.52.

-----

Why did trying to OVERPAY for the option move the price *just* out of reach each time? Moreover, why did entering a MUCH WORSE deal not impact the price whatsoever?

I was assigned 8 x $2.64. Why isn't that the price of the option, then?","Am I huffing paint, or were they fucking me on options trading?",,

When should I take out profit so that I recoup my initial investment and am only working with profit? I'm in Eth, BTC, QQQ. I'm also in Apple which I'm going to dump in favor of VTI ETh is soaring, but will likely drop. Should I take out the profit from it -  $760 - then start from scratch with it? I'm tempted to liquidate it all and put it in VTI, let it grow safely, then make another lump sum investment. I'm fine, for now.",When do you take out profits?,,

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough.

909,2021-05-09 13:47:04,t3_n8el75,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",,

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

The margin $150k is put into a mixo of:

 1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time

2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

&#x200B;

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

  
I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

This post is about two F call options I bought at $23 and $24 on 5/20. I sold them both today at $47 apiece. Can I get a little help understanding profit? At first glance it looks like I've gained $47. 

Is it that simple? I know calculating profits can be a little complicated when it comes to options. Still trying to learn, and I also wanted to post about my success somewhere. Thanks for any input!",Ford Call Option Trade Profit Calculation Help,,

&#x200B;

Say the following happened:

5/1 Buy 1 XYZ @ 340$

5/2 Buy 1 XYZ @ 240$

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$ (sold two shares, split to two transactions for simplicity)

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$

&#x200B;

This would be a pretty substantial loss, however, I'm not sure how to calculate the allowed capital gains/losses for my own books.  Certainly I'd like for the full 500$ in losses to be deductible, however, I don't know how/if that would work out given wash rules.

Would neither be deductible (since for both purchases, there was another purchase within ±30 days of the sale of the same XYZ)?  Or would one be disallowed (and the other one's basis adjusted (does Robinhood even support this?))?

Does the 5k that previously loss a wash? Do I pay tax on the 10,000 I just made or do I pays tax on the 10,000 profit minus my previous loss of 5000. Which would be 5000.

This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",The Weekly DD - IPOE/SoFi: Powering the Future (FinTech),,
