30,,2021-05-19 13:28:27,t3_ng5uqe,,investing,"How one approach diversification, considering this ?

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

50% american stocks (market ETF)
15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
15 % India (market ETF)
10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

The formula is (Unrealized\_Gains + Realized\_Gains + Dividends) / Price

It works fine, but there is one situation when selling stocks and rebuy them. In my example (Buy-Sell-Buy) I assume that I was able to buy stock again at same price I sold it. I didn't use other capital for this, to re-buy the stock I'm using same money. As result it shows 50% ROI even though my initial investment is still 100€ .

I bought it for 100€ the price went up to 200€, I sold it for 200€ (100€ realized gains), I then decided to buy it at same price I sold, so now Price will show as 200€ and realized gains 100€.

Maybe I should calculated ROI at each step - when I buy stock, receive dividend, sell stock and then do some kind of average?

But the central banks are printing MB, and they went to great lengths to ensure that this doesn't spill over too much on M2, that's why you dont see inflation and you probably wont see it.

Central Banks will never let MB translate into M2 at an accelerated rate, so we started paying interest on reserves, we have strict capital requirements since Basel III and a lot of other things that protect our economy from this.

QE is different from Argentina or Zimbabwe money printing, it's controlled.

This ""decay"" or drift isn't a problem, it's mathematically *by design* part of what you get when you get into a daily-resetting leveraged ETF - it's literally just compounding. Over the long term *it's beneficial* because a diversified index like the S&P has more green days than red (59% of days the S%P ends up higher than it began, 41% of days it ends up lower than it began) so that ""decay"" means you get *more than 2x returns of the underlying during bull runs*.

I said a week ago that we were probably not far from a bounce in some speculative growth names given how incredibly oversold many of them were but what would be interesting is to see how sustained the bounces are. You've seen some brief bounces in growth but they've been brief and days like yesterday where growth did actually bounce felt weak/fragile.

I still think growth will bounce but I do think it's going to be a much bumpier year after ""growth stocks only go up"" last year. Additionally, when you look at Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook - they're all up YTD aside from Apple and that YTD decline is relatively minor. 

Huge and highly profitable has held up fine. It's the most speculative stuff that has been obliterated. Last year ""rapidly growing but unprofitable"" had a fantastic year. Now you want the bigger, higher quality, highly profitable names.  The ""we might have a product/service"" in a few years stocks like the battery stuff (QS), space trips where they don't know when they're going to have a *test flight* again (SPCE) and other stuff like that has no support.

I would not be surprised if it's a more difficult year for growth but I do think that when growth becomes back at least a little bit of favor, you might see much more selective buying. There's some stuff I think might never see highs again.",,

The way I find good picks is by really knowing the company. I'm going to use Apple as an example. when the first iPhone came out I decided to invest in their stock because I thought the iPhone was revolutionary. Of course I did my due diligence by researching their iPod, iMac, iTunes products and advertising campaign and how successful they were at creating their products as a lifestyle brand at that time. Along with their quarterly SEC filings. 

Another example would be Netflix. after a few years of being a subscriber to Netflix and not being able to stay away from them for long. I looked into them and how they operate, their SEC filings, their strategy, etc. I decided that it was a great choice for a long term investment. (I've been holding onto it for about 4 years and plan to sell when subscription services no longer are a ""thing"". To follow up on subscription services. if you watched the news about COVID a lot of subscription services did very well last year Zoom would be the best example. I think they will remain strong as long as there is a need for their subscription service in their  marketplace.

A recent example would be Moderna. After hearing in the news and looking into their company I put them on my watch list. I didn't jump in right away but when it became clear to me that they were a strong contender to get FDA EUA approval I decided to jump in. 

For me it's a lot about gut feeling. Along with what I know and use ALOT. then applying it to look at the company. I hope this helps.",,

To view the note later, right click and select the  same  ""thinkLog notes on (symbol)"" then choose ""View (symbol)"". You can  also go to Tools>thinkLog> and use the Search. You may also add  text notes to your charts by following:

You can then go into your watchlist and customize your sorting parameters and add ""Notes"" which will show a little note icon if you have notes written on that specific ticker. See my example below

But then Toyota decided to stop innovating and just coast on their Hybrid technology. R&D was really expensive, so why bother to take it the next step and go for a fully electric vehicle when none of their main competitors were? 

But overtime new startups like Tesla came along and decided they were going to make Electric Vehicles a reality if Toyota and other automakers weren't going to take it seriously. And what's Toyota's reaction been? They've widely mocked EV's from the start, and have become widely hated in the EV community for promoting misinformation about EVs in some of their commercials. Industry insiders have also made clear for years that Toyota stubbornly refuses to believe EVs will be a thing, and thinks that their now ancient hybrids are still their future (along with hydrogen vehicles).

I don't have a crystal ball that says ARK won't go up in the next 30 days but I do feel very confident that it won't go up 30% in 30 days.  If that thesis holds true, it seems that selling to harvest losses is the right move.  For simple math in a purely hypothetical situation, let's say I invested 15k originally and it's now worth 10k.  If it goes up 20% in 30 days (which would be fantastic for just about any stock/ETF) then my original investment would be worth 12k.  However, if I harvest the 5k in losses and buy back in at the +20% price, I've lost out on the 2k gain but am still getting in lower than my original cost basis for the same amount of shares.  So I can use the 5k in losses to offset gains elsewhere and lower my cost basis  The ""gotcha"" is if it makes a big run and goes above my current cost basis or pretty close to it; though I still think TLH can be beneficial as I have some pretty good gains elsewhere and a pretty large tax exposure.

340,,2021-05-19 15:01:36,t3_ng8620,,investing,"I have YOLO'd a significant portion of my portfolio into Field Trip Health based on my bullish opinion that Psychedelics are the future of mental health and human brain development.

Here's Why...

Ketamine Therapy - this is the type of therapy that is currently being offered through Field Trip's clinics.

Ketamine is a Psychedelic substance that (when administered in small doses) can lead to a significant shift in consciousness for a person with severe depression. 

Is Ketamine the answer?

No, I don't believe that it's the answer to our increasing levels of depression. That being said I believe it's a great step in the right direction. 

The Gateway to Magic Mushrooms...

Starting early with legal Ketamine therapy is a tremendous strategy for the company. Making the right connections patients and health authorities early on will prove to be a valuable resource in the next phase which is...

Psilocybin Assisted Therapy....

The chemical that's derived from Magic mushrooms has the very powerful ability to cure people of depression and that is already being proven in clinical trials. 

Psilocybin beats Lexapro - https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994

Where Field Trip Stands on Psilocybin...

It was made clear in a recent interview by co-founder Ronan Levy that he doesn't believe Ketamine is going to be the future of the industry. While there will still be a place for it, he believes that Psilocybin  is likely to surpass Ketamine in terms of overall benefits.

I highly recommend you listen to the interview. It will leave you with a much better understanding of what the company does and where they are headed. 

The full interview - https://youtu.be/8gtyZ8DWwNoq

Growing Revenues...

The main concern with any new startup company, or a new industry for that matter is how will revenues be generated. Field Trip has already proven revenues, which for a company at this stage in the game is impressive to say the least.

They have also managed to increase their revenues each quarter. 

More locations...

The company is planning on building 75 therapy centers over the next few years. Currently they are operating 8 locations, some of which are providing therapy sessions and others that will be soon.

Ticker Info.

CSE: $FTRP 
US OTC: $FTRPF 

Talk to the Co-Founder...

Ronan Levy is the co-founder of the company and he is an open book that will answer your questions. That's another plus for me because I like to play an active roll on my investments and speaking with a representative of the company enables me to do just that.

Ronan Levy - https://twitter.com/RonanDLevy?s=09

Follow him on Twitter and reach out if you have any questions. He is quite busy as you can imagine but still manages to make time for the little guy.

Disclaimer:

I do not work for Field Trip Health. I do own shares and warrants of the company. This is not investing advice but merely an example of my own due diligence. Please do yours before making any financial decisions. 

Best of luck...

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

I wonder much damage was done to savings/investments and how much we will all pay in higher costs for goods, compared to the money that was actually paid out. I fear that it's like $10 we pay now due to inflation for every dollar paid out. Maybe more.

I don't have an issue with the money that was paid out to people (although I think higher income people should not have received the extra $600 a week).... My issue is with the money paid out to businesses. Around here we saw many small businesses that would have failed even without COVID being given sometimes millions of dollars. (You can look this up online.) Not to mention many businesses that aren't small at all and actually have access to alternative financing apply for PPP money and get tens of millions. I don't want to prop up businesses that would have failed even in the absence of COVID and I don't want to send probably billions in total to big companies who could fend for themselves.",,

Also transacting users, rather than just a total number of users, rises to a huge degree in a bull market. They went from 34M users in Q1 2020 to 56M users in Q1 2021, so call it 60% user growth. But transacting users, those making at least one transaction per month, went from 1.3M in Q1 2020 to 6.1M in Q1 2021. So almost 5x due to a bull market. Trade volume also went from $30B to $89B in that span.

Couple all that with BTC going from $6k or so to $60k or so across that one year span and you see why their profits went from $32M in Q1 2020 to $771M in Q1 2021.

586,,2021-05-19 16:40:46,t3_ngamt2,,investing,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class. 

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto. 

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin). 
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic.

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here. 

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",ngamt2,Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?

I was talking about GME rocketing up a second time. The squeeze happened in January.

Do me a favour and check volume in january and how short interest dropped in  the weeks that followed

FYI the market was very red  at the time of the squeeze, indicating that big players were liquidating assets to pay for shares they needed to cover

I dunno why cultists come to months old posts to argue this shit. I don't care anymore. I actually hold a small position myself because I like Cohen am interested in seeing if and how he executes the turn around of the company. But I don't give a shit if it squeezes or not.",,

Not all goods and commodities in the world are hard. When the gold price goes up, opening new mines becomes more profitable. When demand for cars rises, car manufacturing increases.

Because a bond in this scenario is losing money to inflation every year. IE, the coupon you get in return is lower than the inflation rate.

Gold acts somewhat as a pseudo-currency mixed with pseudo commodity. It's a currency in the sense that it can be used to transfer one currency to the next, it's convertible to hard currency around the world, and has a long history as a store of value. It acts as a commodity in the fact that the supply is somewhat limited, gets extracted from the ground, and there are uses in production for physical goods.

As for why it would do well during a period of negative rates, well typically negative real interest rates cause currencies to devalue against other currencies. Gold in this instance would function somewhat as currency that does not move as the local currency devalues around it. That being said, I think there is more to it than that, but that at least gets at the large part of why Gold is a proxy for real rates.",,

If you have enough ounces worth of tokens, they will deliver the gold to you upon request. Paxos is the third crypto custodial agent to meet CFTC muster and was chartered just a couple months ago",,

However, to the extent that has low correlation to other asset classes, it becomes more interesting since it may have a diversification benefit. And, since it is so volatile, you only need to hold a little to have an effect on your portfolio (no leverage needed). That said, it doesn't seem to have the good diversification that one wants when the markets are crashing – gold & long treasuries (& possibly trend-following managed futures/CTAs) are still real (but imperfect) deals in these environments.

Also, since the cryptomarket is so inefficient (i.e. dumb), seems like there is alpha to made over buy & hold. I've been reading a few academic papers, but I'm getting conflicting accounts of the momentum effect there. I'd imagine that if more institutional money goes into bitcoin specifically, then the alpha could get smaller and it will behave more like other assets and probably have an increased correlation with equity.

VIX is a calculated number based on the pricing of S&P 500 options, and unlike an index like the S&P 500, one cannot easily buy a portfolio of assets that replicates its value. Since the VIX futures can't be arbitraged that way, they can deviate significantly from the spot value of VIX. Usually they are priced higher (a state called contango), and as they get closer to expiration, their price falls to converge with spot VIX. Each day, VXX rolls a portion of its futures from the near expiration futures to buy the higher priced next contract to keep its average maturity a static one month out, realizing a loss in the process. This means VXX will fall on average as long as it exists. It is also very volatile and has high kurtosis which makes it quite risky.",,

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for—and value of—certain “over-the-counter (OTC) securities” you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to “Pink No Information” OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E*TRADE from making these products generally available. 

Some background on the new requirements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements. 

Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected. 

What these changes mean for you 

Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell “Pink No Information” OTC securities through E*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any “Pink No Information” OTC securities you hold now or in the future.”

I will also try to assume you care about hearing another perspective on why these narratives persist, and not just rubbing salt in the wound of people who are into this category of asset on a bad day for them.

1) You're cherry-picking losses and dates. Anyone who's bought before February of this year is in still profit right now. It was as low as $3000 when lockdowns were first announced. In that regard, it has been a 10x return year-over-year if you bought at that point. See? Cherry-picking dates is not useful.

>...tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? 

> ...now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class

2) Your point about the USD holding value [is not correct](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1032048/value-us-dollar-since-1640/). I'm assuming you're looking at DXY, for which data goes back to 1980ish, and is compared against a basket of other fiat currencies (which are also being overprinted)?

> How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? 

Try buying a house with a salary from 2009. Things haven't kept up with inflation. They'll tell you there's no inflation until you're only eating rice and beans, living in a van.

**The value proposition of bitcoin is decentralized, cross-border, limited-supply, un-seizable assets.** You can buy these with unlimited stimulus from the government.  

Any asset with limited supply has done fantastically well this year. Why do you think that is? 

In my reading about countries that encountered high inflation, the first year of money printing sends assets through the roof. Then, it creeps into consumer goods. Welp, we're right on time.

Hey man , thank you so much for your reply ,yeah , i know the average SP500 is about 10% ,  not financial advice or 100% sure of all of these ,but all these experts were also TERRIBLY wrong in 2019 when the price stood under 50$  fast forward  only 15 months later price was over 800$ OVER 1500% (yup 150YEARS of average SP500 :)) )  , and again i believe they are extremely wrong , i will explain my reasoning , doge4tesla is happening VERY soon and it will change the entire world as we know it, a lot of people made serious gains with doge and will buy teslas , using doge = doge price will skyrocket = tesla holds that DOGE on the balance sheet = GREATLY increase stock price , renewable crisis now on crypto mining will cause a great demand + gov pushing renewables and offering -26% credits = tesla makes even more profit and accepts doge (also earning doge from settiling payments between the renewable systems solar panels+powerwalls and the grid and imho might offer doge mining for free to incentivize buying of their solar packs= HUGE advantage to a regular joe on making a lot of money easily(free energy in the process for 25years+) = Doge price goes up even more = tesla shares go up , more people buy tesla shares , it's a symbiotic relationship , then tesla ""robotaxi"" fleet is deployed in 2022 , you'll see the biggest growth a large company ever experienced in the history of human kind, people underestimate Elon (GENIUS) , he helped TSLA reach a MC of over half TRILLION $ in less than a decade

Doge will also become the 1st ever REAL AI assisted crypto CURRENCY in the world with the new ADVANCED NEURAL NETWORK DOJO4DOGE chip imho, 10 times faster(soon to be 100TIMES) , 100TIMES lower in fees , 5900TIMES more efficient than Bitcoin(bitcoin is already much faster and environmentally friendly than fiat currency if you DYOR properly= imagine the impact)

But anyway i am 99% sure that 1700$ is nothing (although i believe the highest growth might come a bit later than jan 2022 after the DOGE1 SpaceX mission maybe march to june) ,1% = if there's not any major global financial crisis i am sure the tesla stock price would be at least 5000-9000$ so a risk is always involved in any investment :) but the reward will be COLOSSAL :)

6TR would be roughly less than 7 % of the total stock market isn't it (95TR)

back to the basics of a noob doing conventional investing (Crypto veteran here) :)) , thank you so much for your insight so buying a call on robinhood for example is the easiest way do it for an average joe that already has options trading activated isn't it ? how about things that could go wrong ? any advice ?

Like let's just say my call expires 17jun 2022  , bought this 100shares call for 800$ now (Strike 1725$) , it's 30th of may and i have just a few weeks until expiry date and tesla price per share is 5000$,  but i don't have almost half million $ to exercise them , i try to sell the call on robinhood then ? what if nobody wants to buy it ? can you sell it for less than the daily share price ? how does it work :)",,

People often call stocks an inflation hedge to, but the fact is stocks only beat inflation around three quarters of the time (at least they did as of when The Intelligent Investor was written, which was decades ago). 

BitCoin's may supposedly be a 'currency', but it's really not, it's treated as a speculative investment by everyone, and it behaves like a high risk ultra volatile stock. Like Stocks, Bitcoin may do pretty well overall compared to inflation, but it's not beating it all the time.",,

So by an extension of this thinking, crypto is a pyramid scheme where groups can pool resources to mine a useless crypto and cash that effort in for $$ (enter fiat currency of your choice here.) Everyone else is a vehicle for that effort. if you put cash in the machine, someone on the other side is withdrawing your cash to keep the scheme afloat.

Some of the major knock on effects of this scheme have been felt. Hardware shortages and price gouging, power consumption and subsequent pollution concerns, cyber crime all centered around ransom for crypto, or stealing CPU cycles for mining. I cannot think of a single positive net effect of crypto other than some people made a return on the fiat currency evangelists have claimed this crypto would replace.

Throughout the lifecycle of this bull market, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Amazon doesn't make any money""... ""P/E ratios are through the roof"".... ""Zoom has a negative P/E!""...

I have nothing against companies that make money on their own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to being profitable. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell profit to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

Profit as necessary for a good investment = Bad Narrative  
  
I have said for a long time that profit is an OPTIONAL CHARACTERISTIC . It's yet another in a long line of strong performing indicators that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from operating revenue.  
  
If profit actually served as any form of investment indicator, then why in the world did Apple tank 12% on the day that they announced record earnings for Q1 2021? And nobody can argue that it was a product of the pandemic... since they haven't risen in any significant way since January. And it's now tanked almost 25% at a time when you would expect any idea of profit to be the strongest driver of the share price. Something... doesn't add up here.  
  
Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of profit and ""making money""? And for whatever it's worth, Revenue suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than profit.
