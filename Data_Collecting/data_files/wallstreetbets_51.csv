Two clicks from the home page and I'm on my time sheet for the week, click Actions drop-down menu on the right, Auto-fill from Schedule, check off any days that are holiday or I'm taking PTO, and a few more clicks and my time is in for the week.

Granted some of my employees are required to be more granular to allocate 1hr towards this project, 4hrs towards another project, but I also have salaried employees like myself that just do the 8hrs/day Auto-fill from Schedule option.

So, from my perspective, I'm not sure how the process is any worse than an excel spreadsheet.

If it's a shared spreadsheet, isn't it susceptible to others mistakenly overwriting areas they're not supposed to, or submitting time on someone else's behalf when they think they're on their own line for their submittal? If it's individual spreadsheets that sounds like a mess of files to weed through.",,

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the MOON)

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

1781,,2021-05-28 00:11:27,t3_nmlb2d,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity.

Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself “Am I really that retarded?” Then, he realized “No, it must be Oklahoma that’s retarded!”

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan!

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead?

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

1806,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I’m buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I’m stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

1835,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more get ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus who nvax makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter put it this way...

Imagine if the smile protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does it uses more of a complete picture almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for like the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have liked on this last month
 Fidelity t Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there...the link below in another message. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $600 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip the in mid June when P3 results come out , and anticipation grows for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own 138 $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million on a year's time via shares and options

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to –4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 419, 418, 415\]

# TA Notes:

Same shit, different day.

* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.
* Gapped up but not over 421. :(
* Expecting a slow day, unless memes rocket. These moon missions could destabilize the markets.

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they’ve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they’ve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure. 

So I don’t know what to make of this, is it a real possibility or just BS?",nmxotz,Amazon buying Rite Aid? Will it happen? Or just BS?

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

**The U.S. Mint is pretty much admitting there's a Global supply shortage** :

This why stackers of all levels, whether big or small should feel proud of every gram or ounce of they own.

They are draining the LBMA & CrimeX. In a highly leveraged market “200 paper to 1 physical” by some accounts and “50 paper to 1 physical” by some other accounts;

Us Mint nowadays have a record high demand not seen in theri history .

So what's next :

Aren't they required by constitution to make silver coins in a certain quantity?

So which price ?

Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is really about to end.

THIS IS MEGA. It is even more evidence that the big tidal wave is turning in favour for Silver . Do not miss this train starting out, still very much at the ground floor.

Expecting 15x [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) within 2 years .

From these levels. we are in for inflation, not deflation.

Now silver technical charts : Let's clarify little bit : 

It  was capped at the yellow breakout level 28.3 and is now backtesting green trend line. It is tightly squeezed between the yellow 28.3 level and green trend line. Those kinds of squeezes usually have a clear resolution.

In the end, what do you have to lose by diversifying out of some of your dollar reserves and into physical metal? This is precisely what many central banks around the globe have been doing at a record pace over the last 24 months, and if it's a good idea for them, why isn't it a good idea for you?

In doing so, it's possible you'll help drive a monumental change in how price is derived. With the persistence of the Silver Squeeze movement, I think that we  might just get there (x15 target ) sooner rather than later.",nmytw5,The U.S. Mint is pretty much admitting there's a Global supply shortage

Retail traders were seen as easy marks by institutions early in the game when it was hard to trade and even harder to unify movement.  Now with how easy it is to trade and even easier to unify movement the retail market can drive the market.  Currently the retail traders are limited to moving a small number of companies, however as the generational capital flows begin to move from the silent and greatest generation to the Gen X and yougner crowds the institutions are going to be bleeding AUM.  This is will threaten the industry, but more importantly will threaten the regulators as they will begin to lose funding as much of it comes from the institutions they regulate.  Out of self preservation I believe the regulators will be moving to make retail trading so difficult that it is all but banned.",,

Lots of people started staring at the guy, and as the figure got closer, they realized it was Jeane-Claude Van Damme.  Van Damme wound up walking right next to them.

Institutions were liquidating other positions for liquidty, further driving selling by automatic trigger points.  This brings the market down as a whole.

Sold 10 at $0.20 each and 10 @ $0.23 each within 15 minutes, for a profit of $230.  
Essentially, I've lowered my cost basis on the Leaps to $5.00 each.  
Total risk is now $1000. Reward is unlimited. I like Peter Thiel.  
If the stock reaches $100 before the end of the year, I could have a profit of at least $15,000.  
That would reduce my daughter’s debt by 5%. Pray for me, please.

5002,gzrp2er,2021-05-28 15:30:16,t1_gzrp2er,t3_nmxyif,wallstreetbets,"Financial times article on Jim Cramer BYND pump.
Jim Cramer of CNBC Mad Money fame has never been one to shy away from bodacious market calls that appeal to as broad an investing demographic as possible. In his time, he has inspired everyone from Eric Cartman to your granny (probably) to take a flutter on the market.

But, today before US market open, we were struggling to get our heads around this tweet from the dome-headed financial news host.

What on earth is going on here?


One generous interpretation is that Cramer likes fake meat purveyor Beyond Meat’s stock. Why wouldn’t he? After all the $9bn “growth” company grew, err, 11 per cent last quarter making its valuation of 13 times forward revenues seem totally reasonable. Depending on how you spin it, anyway. So perhaps that’s it?


Or perhaps Cramer is not so subtly signalling to the Reddit retail trading army of r/WallStreetBets that the stock is ripe for a short-squeeze. After all, on Monday he did suggest it could be the next meme stock, like dying cinema chain AMC.

To be honest we don’t have a clue.

But if the latter is the case, the tendie-hungry masses seem to have got the message.

In early trading, Beyond Meat’s stock is up nine per cent to $138 on absolutely no news. They did touch $144 earlier.

Cool.

Here’s an idea, though. If we (and yes, that means even FT Alphaville) want to shed the scaly reputation of professional financial journalism perhaps it is better if we don’t go around suggestively egging on the masses into so-called meme securities?

Actually, we’re talking about CNBC here aren’t we? Sorry. Our mistake.",,

I do love it when users say they don't know about this price by EOY when literally there are a ton of stocks who definitely don't deserve the levels their at but are. I honestly believe that not rebranding BB with a new name is a bad idea. I think when the new CEO comes in next year they'll do it. Chen has had his run ( since 2013 ) but it's time for him to retire ( he's going to be 65 soon ) and they need to find someone young fresh and more energetic to run the company. BB is a long play but it def will pay off especially with their QNX tech and the future of electric and self driving vehicles.,,

Biden is proposing to renew them for 10 years. Sunrun has 15% of float short, so if the clean energy bill proposed by senate passes, or they include the tax credits in the infrastructure bill, get ready for fireworks. Notwithstanding the credits, sunrun is a great company, with most PTs in 70-80s. They also recently announced partnership to install ford f150 chargers/sell them solar. That’s general thesis.

It was discussed in detail on the earnings call if you skip to 10:00 in. If anything, the past wear could be a sign of accelerated wear which details are being held on, causing the the maintenance schedule to potentially be moved up in between some of these next 3 flights.

5779,gzrq5fb,2021-05-28 15:38:06,t1_gzrq5fb,t3_nmue5k,wallstreetbets,"Not doing a write-up as a full post, but here's the current gamma structure of AMC as of open this AM. It's probably shifted some as people jet in and out of options. The spike at open probably corresponded to dealer hedging of all of those calls in the 30-35 range that became in or very near the money today.

[https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8](https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8)

Note that about half of the gamma vaporizes today and with that is a lot of delta evaporating too (about 18% of total delta). And, the dealers at open were holding $3.7B of shares as well according to spot gamma. That value would've climbed up significantly in the open. That means that you may see something more like 25-30% of delta getting dropped from the open to the close, which ends up being more like $1.5B or something.

What does this mean? Well, it means that there will be selling pressure today if this price doesn't break up. There's a gamma ramp down more than up, but more importantly, a lot of calls are expiring OTM today, and as the day goes on, dealers de-hedge. If a gamma ramp happens, it would be hard for the price to go a lot past $40 because the options wear out there. And, there's a big gap between $35 and $40 in terms of dealer support, which we saw in the fizzle this morning. 

It's probably easier to buy this at a low today and hope for next week, than to win today, unless you see a big increase in momentum - the dealer flows will be very significant.",,

5886,gzrqb3e,2021-05-28 15:39:13,t1_gzrqb3e,t1_gzrhyje,wallstreetbets,"I see people tried to answer some of this, but didn't break it down to its very basic explanation.

A 17c... Is a call for $17.  The $17 is called the ""strike price. The strike price is what he is gambling on.  That is, the closer that it gets to $17, or if it exceeds $17, the value of the call contract increases.

The price doesn't have to go to $17 to make money, but in the best case world, the price would exceed $17.  

A call contract is for a hundred shares.  So a 59 cent $17 call actually cost $59 (59 cents * 100 shares). 

The expiration date, is the point at either the call option is exercised or it expires worthless.  It would expire worthless if the current share price is lower than the strike price.  As an example, it would make no sense to exercise a $17 call if the share price is $15. 

You can exercise a call option at any time, which allows you to purchase the hundred shares at the strike price.  

So if the share price is $33, one contract allows the person that owns it to exercise it and purchase 100 shares at $17 each.  The $59 premium is not the purchase price of the shares, that was the premium to have the right to purchase 100 shares. So exercising the call is still going to cost him $1,700 ($17*100 shares). 

The vast majority of people do not exercise contracts.  They buy the contract, and then sell it after it's value increases. Or they buy a contract, and it expires worthless.

The majority of people let's play with contracts lose money.",,

6070,gzrqk7c,2021-05-28 15:41:03,t1_gzrqk7c,t1_gzrldru,wallstreetbets,"There are others in this comment section that have touched on it, but I’ll give it a go here for kicks.

Calls are basically contracts that allow someone to buy 100 shares of a stock per 1 contract after the stock reaches a strike price.

So if you see 20C, that means it’s a call with a strike price of 20.  If the market value of the stock is over 20 by expiration, you can exercise the contract and buy the 100 shares at the price of 20 apiece.  

However, there’s a premium you’ll have paid for the right to do this; let’s say it’s .59.  That means you pay .59 per share in the contract (so .59*100=59) and that’s your cost to buy the call up front, is 59.  This means the stock value needs to hit 20.59 for you to come out even from exercising the call option.  After that, you would make whatever the price is -20.59= Your total profit.

Puts are the opposite: you buy a contract that allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. So 17P would be a put that gives you the right to sell a stock for 17 if it happens to go below that price.  Again, it has to go lower than 17-(your premium you paid) for you to make money exercising it.

I’m thinking you can figure out what you’re hoping the stock will do depending on which one you bought (and conversely, which one you sell, if you’re offering the option initially, where you’re the one that’s allowing someone to buy 100 shares at a price or sell their 100 shares to you at a certain price).

TD you’ll probably want to visit the good old Google to see where their options buying and selling are.  Options require a decent amount of investment into learning them and how to buy and sell them, so it seems like it would be doing you a disservice just handing you all the info on how to get that set up so that you end up falling into it without really knowing anything about them.",,

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the MOON)

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

I already made a few schekels scalping some OTM calls on SPCE earlier this week playing the successful flight and launch and then came across this little diddy.

I've been thinking about playing it with Space stocks like MAXR, LMT, SPCE, BA and others. I've been watching MAXR since it shat the bed after earnings and it has been up every day since... I wonder if it is in preparation for the release?

In all seriousness, does anyone think this might be something to ""Explore?""

Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on “Rhodium” that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself “Am I really that retarded?” Then, he realized “No, it must be Oklahoma that’s retarded!”

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could’ve been anyone’s guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let’s all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

6328,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

6351,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

6356,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more get ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus who nvax makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter put it this way...

Imagine if the smile protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does it uses more of a complete picture almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for like the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have liked on this last month
 Fidelity t Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there...the link below in another message. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $600 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip the in mid June when P3 results come out , and anticipation grows for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own 138 $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million on a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation which will confirm all of this ...

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to –4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

I've been lurking on wsb for some time now (as a guest) and I know there has been a huge price spike earlier this year on the stock (which then made it $1B mkt cap) but I honestly don't get it why PETS is being forgotten ever since.

I've been looking in to the fundamentals of the company and the business is looking extremely good, I don't see the reasoning behind the shortselling (30% of float are short) of this company.

1) PETS has a profitable business (which is well known in the US) that generates plenty of FCF that covers the generous dividend (which is $1.20 / 4.13%).  
2) PETS does not have any debt on its balance sheet.  
3) PETS has a Return on Equity/Return on invested capital of 22.5% (which is quite good)  
4) For some reason, 30% of PETS shares are being sold short. The only reason I can think of is the fact that at some point their business can be copied by Amazon or some other company but I honestly don't see that happen any time soon.  


I've also checked reviews on the app of the company and their service in general. It seems that PETS scores really well on them.   


All in all I'm really bullish on the stock, I don't see the reasoning behind the shortselling and if at some point the shorts get squeezed out, this stock has the potential to get the valuation it should get.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms. 

 ""The Global [\#Silver](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Silver?src=hashtag_click) Shortage"" acknowledged by the US Mint on their Facebook page.   Now they sent those email to customers.  There is a holy smokes now everywhere .

This why stackers of all levels, whether big or small should feel proud of every gram or ounce of they own.

They are draining the LBMA & CrimeX. In a highly leveraged market “200 paper to 1 physical” by some accounts and “50 paper to 1 physical” by some other accounts;

Us Mint nowadays have a record high demand not seen in their history .

So what's next :

Aren't they required by constitution to make silver coins in a certain quantity?

So which price ?

Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is really about to end.

THIS IS MEGA. It is even more evidence that the big tidal wave is turning in favour for Silver . Do not miss this train starting out, still very much at the ground floor.

I suppose we will have to wait till analysis is finished and hear back from VG.
