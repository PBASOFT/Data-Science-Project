Yes, you can buy and sell an option the same day, but it would be considered a day trade. Otherwise there is nothing stopping you from doing it. You will not have to wait for a buyer because as long as there is a bid above $0.0 then there is a buyer who has a bid on the record. You may not be able to sell it at the price you want to, but you can always sell it at the bid price. Be careful of fees though. Most brokerages charge an opening and closing fee on options. TD Ameritrade is $0.65 per contract which ends up being $1.30 for the entire transaction. 

It is not a glitch, the value of options contracts are constantly changing value, even those that expire two years from now (commonly called leaps). Definitely do some more research before you get into buying and selling options. 

One other thing that is really important to know is that Options are different from shares of stock in that they lose value over time. You can‚Äôt just hold them forever. A simple way of looking at it is that with a call or a put if the stock price doesn‚Äôt change each day your contract will be less valuable. There are other variables, like volatility, that affect the price as well, but your biggest enemy when you are buying calls or puts is time.",,

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

theres a couple large hfs which have a vested interest in gme - look to pltr as a model. they own a fuck ton of shares at low cost basis, but know that selling their shares would most likely fuck the price immediately.

so what do they do? sell options wholesale and collect premium. through options mechanics this causes a mid-month rise and an eom fade. it (along with rc tweets) also keeps volatility up so they can continue harvesting premium next month.

eventually their shares get called away and options driven movements on gme will dampen, causing a permanent drop in price.",,
