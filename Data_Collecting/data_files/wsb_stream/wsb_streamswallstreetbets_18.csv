Is it going to tank on Tuesday after the holiday now?

What is going to happen next week?

I got paid yesterday fellow Apes (Friday 5/28).

I was not able to buy anymore shares of AMC because my check didn’t hit my account until after market close. 

Everything I have left over after bills is going right into AMC. 

I don’t want this to end, Apes. 

I don’t want us to look back on this opportunity and think, “What if…”

I have something to ask of you all…

We don’t each need to put in $1,000,000 to keep this trend moving the way we want. 

What if each one of us put in $1 on Tuesday?

What would happen?

Whether it’s $1, $5, $10 or $20, what would happen if we all put in whatever we could afford?

The transactions are all part of the algorithm that governs the momentum of the stock. 

I ask you all, fellow Apes, will you join me and keep this ride going the way we want and need it to go?

Please. 

Let’s not let this opportunity and momentum go to waste and don’t sell unless it’s a hardship.

If we do this together I think we can keep this going forever. 

Stay strong everyone.

Well I was right, I predicted 70%  , sank 50. 
I do not think this is over YET. I feel like this bubble has turned into another meme.

Let me explain.. I am 25 years old, I have Autism, Absolutly Autastic, Whetever Okay,.
I have 8 years Forex trading experience, And I had a feeling the ""Btcoin Boom"" was getting over inflated, mostly due to prices hitting $65k USD.

I listen to market news A-LOT  soo. Everyone whos got the $$$$$
Are telling all over the radio. We are long,  We have so and so much

Well Cathy Woods.  I have taken a short position on Btcoin against you. 
Now with the other guys letting me know from many capital funds. Yes they are all long
I would like to show the world, What reddit can really do. We are Blessed as one.

I know you may be buying or be ""long"" on Btcoin, but this run is not over yet. 

Here is some reasons I have written that have some points. Why I am short Btcoin.

Btcoin  problems

⦁	 Environmental impact (inc, use of fossil fules, and renewables) We need this backup supply.
⦁	Elon's depreciating tweets on btcoin, makes $1B and loses it, still holds. Facing a level of 35k, He could sell all of his btcoin.
⦁	FOMO is strong for long traders, Btcoin holding short of 40$k
⦁	Iran and china effectively banned crypt0 mining, now Beijing
⦁	Illegal mining activity is 6:1 on the negative side in iran alone, I predict its around 2:1 across the globe. Now if half the planet shut off their miners, I would like to think Btcoin will drop to 20k levels. 
⦁	US regulations around tax, tax evasion fraud and enhanced capital gains tax
⦁	The exposure to fraud , destroyed coins due to many fraudulent reasons. IRS  HMRC  and so on.
⦁	UK bank mark carney speaks ahead about warning to crypt0 this year
⦁	Over inflation bubble/boom , including the hyperinflating asset (Btcoin)
⦁	$600m worth of put options at ratio of 1.35 over the entire amount of long calls.. A disadvantage to longs, problematic for uptrend, prior to expiry of options 28th may 2021. 
⦁	Net short interest over btcoin  This is equivalent to a $100m in open interest. As previously said, the call (buy) options at $46k and higher are potentially worthless
Many Sharks Long btcoin, ""Thinking over the water""  

I know ,  maybe this is strange.
But if you care to join my rusty MOB   
Cathie woods. I bet you lose 60% , hope your still holding that trade!
Get at me with a reply degenerates.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

In the past potential treatments for Alzheimer's have focused on other mechanisms and failed, and this is a unique approach to treating the disease. The usual antibiotics don't work against this bacteria, so the drugs that Cortexyme has patented are unique and the treatment can't be mass produced as a generic antibiotic.

Their market cap is currently around $1 billion. Inside ownership is at 20%, indicating that the owners believe in the future of the company and their drug candidates. Short interest is 25%, which is a lot of shares that will need to be covered in the event that one of their clinical trials has a good news cycle. With drugs in the pipeline for phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials, it's a risky bet but one that could pay off huge if they actually get a drug to market.  A treatment for Alzheimer's disease would be especially huge, as there are currently zero effective treatments approved by the FDA right now and a drug for this disease would easily rake in billions.  The downside is that if their drugs don't pan out, the stock will end up in the toilet.

Proof.

Let X be the set of natural numbers that aren’t interesting.  Then X has a least element, say a.  a is the smallest non interesting natural number.  That’s an interesting property.  Therefore a is interesting and cannot be a non interesting number, contradicting the fact that a is not interesting.  Therefore, there is no smallest natural number that isn’t interesting, and thus all natural numbers are interesting.

QED

As a quick lemma, we can also show there are real numbers which are not interesting.

Take the free group consisting of all letters of the alphabets we use to describe something.  That is a countable set, which cannot be mapped injectively to the uncountable set of real numbers, thus there exists real numbers which are not interesting.

Thursday night previews, for what it looking like a $47.5M 3-day, $57.4M 4-day opening at 3,726 theaters for a $15,4K theater average. That’s a number which isn’t too far from the $60M which the John Krasinski-directed sequel was expected to do in its 3-day opening pre-pandemic!

I am also assuming you aren't a complete idiot and you've actually done research that legitimately indicates this company is worth more than the steaming pile of shit.

You made a few mistakes with this post, outside the rule violations. 

You reference this stock as looking good and being worth far more than its price. However, other than vague references to its assets being worth 100x its market cap you provide almost no description of the company or what it does beyond something with motels. 

Where do you get your valuation of the companies assets? Link to the documents?

Can you expand on the topic of what the company does and why it's value should be higher? 

Are you considering the liquidity of the companies assets when you are coming up with your valuation? What I mean by this is, if they own 1000 roach infested motels that no one wants but are technically worth $500,000 each on paper, you'd get a value of $500,000,000 despite there being no market for the assets and no real way to realize that value.

What service does the organization provide? What does their 10Q look like? What percentage of their market do they control?

Why is the current value so vastly different from its ""real"" value, in your opinion?

If you are going to make a post on something like this, you need to clearly lay out what the company is, what it's currently valued at, why it's currently priced there, and why you think it will go up. Usually it's best to provide sources for your arguments. 

Best of luck if you don't get banned.",,

If you trade futures (on any index, gold, oil, bonds ect) and you are considered a 'trader' then you get taxed 60/40.  The IRS definition of a 'trader' needs looking into.  Probably if you don't make a lot then technically you might not be considered a 'trader', but the IRS probably doesn't care.  Certainly if you make a decent proportion of your income from trading futures and trade them regularly, then you are considered a 'trader' can use the 60/40 rule.
