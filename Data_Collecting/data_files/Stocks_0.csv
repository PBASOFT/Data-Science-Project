2,2021-05-15 21:17:50,t3_nd8qdc,nd8qdc,stocks,"One thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.  I see a lot of posts and comments from people upset about their investment/trading choices not working out, and I think a lot of that comes from a lack of acknowledgement of the risks associated with stocks.  It often times seems as though people interpret 'high risk/high reward' as 'most likely high reward with maybe a small short term downside'.

This post isnt meant endorse a bear or a bull case in general - make your own decisions based on your research.  This post is more to encourage people to try to better understand the downside possibilities of different positions.

For starters, an all stock portfolio, even one where you're only invested in passive tracking funds, has historically been considered pretty high risk.  SPY was around $150 in 2000, and touched the $80s in 2002 and 2008.  This represents more than a 40% loss for someone who didnt dca into it during that period.  People starting out this year should acknowledge that sort of thing could possibly happen over the next 8 years, even if you don't think it will.  

Individual stocks, even the safe, mature dividend stocks, can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions.  Competition pops up, costs increase, demand shifts, technology changes.  Nothing is 100% safe from a large drop given a bad turn of events.  Highly speculative stocks without earnings are even more sensitive and susceptible to large drops as we've seen recently.  Maybe these stocks continue to grow in anticipation of big future earnings, but they've also got the potential to lose most of their value if the market conditions turn against them.

Before I buy a stock, I go through the history and outlook for that company and also for that industry.  I take special note of downturns and acknowledge what I think is a reasonable downside for that particular stock.  Acknowledging and accepting those risks help me stay away from trades that are higher risk than I actually want, and helps me keep my conviction when my choices are struggling.

If you're new to investing and trading, make sure you give enough thought to how far the stock or etf you're researching could fall, and make a reasonable decision on if that fits with your appetite for risk.",Discussing the risks associated with stocks,,

Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.

12,2021-05-16 12:06:34,t3_ndmxwe,ndmxwe,stocks,"What if I told you there was a stock that offers a \~6-7% dividend AND has potential for revenue growth, is that something you would be interested in? That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently [**increased expectations**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/at-t-raises-hbo-max-target-to-as-many-as-150-million-subscribers#:~:text=AT&T%20Inc.,key%20to%20the%20company) of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

However, the current S&P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can’t justify a 2% yield on S&P considering it’s a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will.

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.

As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest. That makes sense, but again I wonder what their angle is. I really don’t want to get myself in a bad situation because I’m ignorant.

As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).  


The stock offers a nice dividend to top it all off, the only time it diluted is when it made some acquisitions for basically pennies on the dollar at the height of the pandemic (great moves), and run by good management.   They’ve even kept paying the dividend, paying it out every quarter still, with Q1 2020 being the sole exception, when everything was closed.

I am not a financial advisor and I am not good at writing DD’s with fancy colors and graphs. Please do your own research before investing

About 2 months ago we saw the fallout of Archegos, and Bill Hwang become a laughing stock after losing 20 billion dollars from his margin call. Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) were among the hardest hit in that selloff. Let’s cut to the chase on why this is this is ready for takeoff, and that big buyers are gonna swoop this back up to new highs 

For starters, the stock currently has a moderately high short interest ratio of 25%. It’s amongst the top shorted stocks within the NYSE. 

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/

On top of the moderately high short interest, you might notice $DISCA is the class A version of the stock. There are actually two other tickers discovery sells shares for: $DISCB and $DISCK. What’s very interesting is despite $DISCK and $DISCA shares trading relatively similar prices, $DISCB shares have actually soared since the selloff, and are trading at double the amount of the regular class A shares. What’s the difference between class A and class B shares? Simple.

“The difference between Class A shares and Class B shares of a company’s stock usually comes down to the number of voting rights assigned to the shareholder.  Class A shareholders generally have more clout”


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp

Now, why is this due for a squeeze? Today, news came out about AT&T wanting to combine media assets with discovery, pushing the valuation of the company to a whopping 150 Billion dollars. Currently, Discovery’s market cap sits at a valuation of 17.41 billion dollars, meaning this merger would push its valuation up 8.6x. I dont know about you guys but that sounds pretty wild to me.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/5aeba5f9-2e00-4cba-b9c7-e0431aad798b

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE!

54,2021-05-17 12:14:09,t3_neemc8,neemc8,stocks,"Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS. 

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise. 

I don't know if i'm just missing something or it's just me, I haven't read much debate/discussion on this when reading about TWLO so just curious on people's thoughts.",TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete?,,

Why they are not valued in the $200-$300/share range is beyond me. Currently, they are in the $75 range. They were as low as $15 back in April 2020, meaning at one point, their P/E ratio was even *lower* than what it is now.

I got a few shares of AAPL (I’m a total fanboy) at 135 and quickly learned I should have DCA’d. I started to diversify, adding in small $10-20 portions of GOOG, AMZN and FB here or there—whenever I saw a dip ($50 in each so far).

I have 10 shares of FNMA at about $2 (my friend from college was convinced it will moon...)

I dabbled in crypto with about $200 (split between ETH, ADA, MATIC,BTC) but because of my timing the results have so far been *dismal*—so I’m here today!

I’m considering UAL as a reopening play, and want to diversify out of just tech. Maybe into alternative energy/sustainability projects, and perhaps in gene mapping and editing techs but I don’t really know where to start.

Since most of my assets are crashing I want to invest in some safer ETFs. I’m thinking SPDR and NASDAQ, and maybe some tech and green energy ones, and some that will profit from massive gov infrastructure spending. Again I don’t know where to start.  

I’ve seen a lot of mentions that “growth” stocks are bad and “value” stocks are good because of worries about inflation. But I have no idea what the difference is. Is now even a smart time to invest? I feel like I should have done this a year ago... :(

I’m in this for the long haul, but I don’t want to invest in something that might be *deep* red the next few years (hence I’m not putting a dime more into crypto; stocks and etfs seem as safe as savings by comparison and that’s what brought me here)

62,2021-05-17 15:20:07,t3_nej11l,nej11l,stocks,"Retail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months. The biggest gainers in this space are DDS (Dillards) and PLCE (The Children's Place). Both could be considered boomer stocks that still rely on brick & mortar, especially Dillards. But both company's are carrying strong tailwinds from reopening and pent up demands.

PLCE has Q1 earnings coming up on May 20. PLCE mainly sells children's clothing. And I think analysts and investors are pricing in the next 4 months of growth as COVID is lifting, kids will need new clothing for summer (parties, birthdays, etc) as well as back to school in 4 months. PLCE in Q4 reported that their digital sales are up, but that they're revenues are still down. Macro factors, they're still worried about declining birth rates. Since January, PLCE is up almost 70%, mostly through reliable increasing revenues and earnings. Despite revenue not beating expectations, they're still doing well.

One thing to note with PLCE using their Q4 2020 returns: https://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/26f7ea63-8d41-481a-984d-b53f68e13032

In February 2, 2019 they made $1.9B in sales with profit of $111M.  At that time, their stock was trading at about $100. They're on track to hit that number in 2021 and even surpass it based on analyst estimates. We could see 50% more upside from PLCE if their Q1 results show anywhere near $600M in sales.

DDS is a different story. DDS just announced a $500M share buyback and a $0.15 dividend. This was on Friday. And since then, DDS has jumped almost 40%. It opened Friday at $107 and its currently trading at $142. On Friday, it was trading as low as $100 at one point.

A $500M share buyback will be done at the market:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-announces-stock-buyback-worth-%24500m-to-pay-%240.15-quarterly-dividend-2021-05-17

> Under the new buyback program, the company can acquire securities via open market transactions as well as private negotiations.

The dividend is payable on August for investors as of June 30.

The P/S ratios of the department store industry are between 0.28 and 0.50, with DDS being on the high side. But their revenues are increasing and with a share buyback that will lower their total float, thus decreasing their P/S, DDS could be an exciting story. The funny thing is that DDS options have spiked in IV, so I would probably buy shares to avoid any major losses due to stock dump after June 30's ex-dividend date.

If you're looking non-tech plays to diversify your portfolio, but still have some aggressive gains, PLCE and DDS may be nice additions.


Anecdotally, many states are reducing social distancing restrictions. I could see department stores getting lots of benefits from traditional forms of shopping. I don't think the retail-pocalypse has destroyed the entire industry quite yet.",Specialty retail stocks are bumping: PLCE and DDS particularly,,

Hi there I have a dilemma I need help on. I have some money to invest upwards of 50-100k for dividends stocks from recent riskier investments and I’m just wondering what is the better option in terms of yeild with the tax on American dividends being larger. One company is Canadian EIT.un. Great company, 10-11% yeild right now. Pay monthly dividend which I like hate waiting for quarterly. Have been paying same dividend for 20 years. 

Or we have ORC which pays 14-15%. Also pays monthly. Company seems solid and both have a long MR of 30% so I can margin them both the same to get my levered dividends for more gains. 

Now my question is for the math and tax experts. Since this money can’t go into a TFSA as mine is currently maxed out, what is the better play for yeild after the tax mans comes for his fair share? Love the 15% but not if is going to be a hot 8% after.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). 

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

I am new to this group but wanted some advice. I am 30 years old and I have about $120,000 in the Betterment investing app. I also have an IRA in TD Ameritrade in which I own an S&P 500 tracking fund (IVE). Betterment has served me well so far and performed pretty well got no complaints there, but I am wondering if it is time to withdraw my funds from Betterment and put all that money into the S&P 500. Betterment has a very wide reach (small caps, large caps, total stock market, foreign, emerging, etc)...but I feel like I would outperform if I just stuck to the S&P 500. Thoughts?

79,2021-05-17 17:44:17,t3_nemqxc,nemqxc,stocks,"If you are looking for moons and rocketships this is not the due diligence for you. This is the due diligence for those who want to round out their portfolio with an unexciting albeit profitable upstream energy stock that won a huge race for something you likely aren't even aware of: the highly profitable DJ Basin. 

BCEI's current price is 41.90, and its forecasted range is 47.00 to 66.00. [Forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BCEI), and more [forecasts](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcei/analyst-research).

Importantly, they have recently participated in a 1-for-1 with another company and I believe the market simply hasn't internalized their new size.

2021 estimated EBITDA puts them at 3.4x as last Friday's close. This is inexpensive vs the greater U.S. upstream peer group and, importantly, compares to 4.1x standalone BCEI. In other words, if the new company is simply valued in the same ballpark as BCEI alone there's significant upside, and there's nothing about the upcoming merger that should indicate a discount. In fact the opposite is the true, consolidation demands a premium.

A similar conclusion can be reached from a DCF valuation, but given the recent merger I think it's more useful to observe pre-merger 10-year free cash flow is a hair under 1 billion. The target should be 50 regardless of the merger, so depending on how you peg the risks with the merger, well, it's up to you. There is a world where BCEI is like an upstream energy company of this size and trades at 70 with a DCF like all the rest. 

**Who Should Get This Stock?**

If you're looking to get rich fast, the NBA and NHL playoffs are just around the corner and sportsbooks are taking bets 24/7. If you're looking to invest, consult with your financial advisor about BCEI. 

I invested because it is something I can forget about for a few months, and when I come back after the ex-dividend date I accept the five or six percent growth, the three percent dividend, and before I know it I'm up 50% and I want to share some good news about a stock that defines the unsexy, good business practices of upstream energy in Colorado. 

**What's BCEI?**

BCEI is a pure-play rural DJ Basin operator. ""Pure-play"" as in they focus solely on extracting oil and natural gas from Denver's Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin. The tl;dr is BCEI possesses a lot of rural Colorado acreage plus very low operating costs plus significant free cash flow. Combined, it equals it's still undervalued compared to peers in spite of the run up the last few months. 

They will also be the first net zero upstream Colorado company, using offsets to become carbon neutral. Aside from being just good stewards of the environment, they are able to do this because of the fundamentally sound structure of their company. Compared to peers they have less wellheads that make more money. In the DJ Basin, if your wellheads make a lot of money it's because they produce more oil than natural gas. Natural gas is typically put right into the atmosphere and uncaptured. Because their wellheads are more oil than wasted natural gas, they cost less than their peers and they can afford to invest in these fixed wellheads rather than running from spot to spot letting natural gas get fired off into the air. [Source](https://ibb.co/5krgsGP)

**Upside?**

The reason I love BCEI is because consolidation is the name of the game in the DJ, and they have the best chance to be the big fish that eats all the smaller fish. Whatever company is able to gobble up the other fish the fastest is going to make a lot of money, partially because the DJ Basin is already profitable and partially because increased oil prices are going to push margins up.

The reason BCEI is going to win consolidation is because they developed zero debt during the downturn, and they are already swinging their free cashflow and zero debt around in a huge way. 

They are going to combine with a smaller, more debt-heavy, competitor and the combined company, to be named Civitas, will create the largest upstream player in the DJ Basin. It's going to be a 1-for-1 merger. This follows after the outright purchase of Highpoint several months ago. [Picture of acreage](https://ibb.co/yRNSXnR)

The annual dividend of $1.40 recently announced by BCEI will be increased to $1.60 as soon as the deal closes. Notably, of the significant expected free cash flow for the combined company, the dividend, at the new higher level, only represents an annual outlay of just under $100 mm.

**Downside?**

Downside is that they go sideways, maybe lose their luster, and go back to being severely undervalued rather than their current ""normal"" of simply undervalued. This isn't financial advice, good stocks go tits up all the time. Shit happens.

**Conclusion**

What are they going to do with the rest of the cash? In the past they've played it smart buying high quality companies in their market, like HighPoint Resources, and used these synergies to grow YoY. For example last quarter, with quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share, they beat estimates of $0.73-.76 per share. Their forward looking guidance indicates continued success. Chances are there is a special dividend and/or continued consolidation, which is where the upside comes into play.","$BCEI DD -- No Moons or Rockets, Just Classic DD About an Undervalued Energy Company",,

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

91,2021-05-17 20:21:09,t3_neqr5i,neqr5i,stocks,"'Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after Morgan Stanley 's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.

According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.

The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.

Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.

Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.

""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

If NET performs well and the markets don’t die, you might see share price go up 75% from where it is now over the next several years (as an example, not a prediction). They may also die off.

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day. 

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered. 

## Playing to win 

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,

Checking back after a few weeks and seeing it higher than you expected is an amazing feeling. You dont get that if you check it everyday and watch it slowly move up.

Its honestly liberating to know you have made good solid choices and dont have to watch it like a hawk everyday. If your choices are good, you wont be coming back to a massacre, and if it is lower, you know its only temp.

There is a bit of an addiction going on when you see it go up or down everyday. You become a lot more emotionally invested in it, and it hurts more when you see red on it, even if that red is only temp. 

Not watching it for weeks lets you get some distance, clarity, and you arent as attached or feel the pain as acutely when it goes red.

Not really.  The ""potential"" people kept claiming was that it would be the main electric car provider and beat out everybody else, but all the major brands have brand loyalty, better infrastructure, and are poised to pump out EVs when there's actually significant demand.

Their other ""potential"" would be their self driving, which is not even close to ""full self driving"" as it is so titled.  The fact alone that it's called ""full self driving"" in its current state should be a huge red flag.  That's be like calling a roomba a personal AI assistant.  Scumbag marketing

Their other ""potential"" is their solar capabilities.  Bailing out your failing company in what many deemed an illegal move, is not a plus.

222,2021-05-15 21:17:50,t3_nd8qdc,nd8qdc,stocks,"One thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.  I see a lot of posts and comments from people upset about their investment/trading choices not working out, and I think a lot of that comes from a lack of acknowledgement of the risks associated with stocks.  It often times seems as though people interpret 'high risk/high reward' as 'most likely high reward with maybe a small short term downside'.

This post isnt meant endorse a bear or a bull case in general - make your own decisions based on your research.  This post is more to encourage people to try to better understand the downside possibilities of different positions.

For starters, an all stock portfolio, even one where you're only invested in passive tracking funds, has historically been considered pretty high risk.  SPY was around $150 in 2000, and touched the $80s in 2002 and 2008.  This represents more than a 40% loss for someone who didnt dca into it during that period.  People starting out this year should acknowledge that sort of thing could possibly happen over the next 8 years, even if you don't think it will.  

Individual stocks, even the safe, mature dividend stocks, can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions.  Competition pops up, costs increase, demand shifts, technology changes.  Nothing is 100% safe from a large drop given a bad turn of events.  Highly speculative stocks without earnings are even more sensitive and susceptible to large drops as we've seen recently.  Maybe these stocks continue to grow in anticipation of big future earnings, but they've also got the potential to lose most of their value if the market conditions turn against them.

Before I buy a stock, I go through the history and outlook for that company and also for that industry.  I take special note of downturns and acknowledge what I think is a reasonable downside for that particular stock.  Acknowledging and accepting those risks help me stay away from trades that are higher risk than I actually want, and helps me keep my conviction when my choices are struggling.

If you're new to investing and trading, make sure you give enough thought to how far the stock or etf you're researching could fall, and make a reasonable decision on if that fits with your appetite for risk.",Discussing the risks associated with stocks,,

That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently [**increased expectations**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/at-t-raises-hbo-max-target-to-as-many-as-150-million-subscribers#:~:text=AT&T%20Inc.,key%20to%20the%20company) of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

However, the current S&P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can’t justify a 2% yield on S&P considering it’s a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

Doctor: “We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!”

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

&#x200B;

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will.

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.

As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest.

In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).

I am not a financial advisor and I am not good at writing DD’s with fancy colors and graphs. Please do your own research before investing

About 2 months ago we saw the fallout of Archegos, and Bill Hwang become a laughing stock after losing 20 billion dollars from his margin call. Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) were among the hardest hit in that selloff. Let’s cut to the chase on why this is this is ready for takeoff, and that big buyers are gonna swoop this back up to new highs 

For starters, the stock currently has a moderately high short interest ratio of 25%. It’s amongst the top shorted stocks within the NYSE. 

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/

On top of the moderately high short interest, you might notice $DISCA is the class A version of the stock. There are actually two other tickers discovery sells shares for: $DISCB and $DISCK. What’s very interesting is despite $DISCK and $DISCA shares trading relatively similar prices, $DISCB shares have actually soared since the selloff, and are trading at double the amount of the regular class A shares. What’s the difference between class A and class B shares? Simple.

“The difference between Class A shares and Class B shares of a company’s stock usually comes down to the number of voting rights assigned to the shareholder.  Class A shareholders generally have more clout”


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp

Now, why is this due for a squeeze? Today, news came out about AT&T wanting to combine media assets with discovery, pushing the valuation of the company to a whopping 150 Billion dollars. Currently, Discovery’s market cap sits at a valuation of 17.41 billion dollars, meaning this merger would push its valuation up 8.6x. I dont know about you guys but that sounds pretty wild to me.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/5aeba5f9-2e00-4cba-b9c7-e0431aad798b


Overall, it looks like this is headed back upwards. Archegos gave everyone the perfect “buy the dip” opportunity.","Disco for $DISCA. Why Discovery is the play, and why it’s due for a short squeeze",,

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE! 

Lastly, the technicals on the chart finally straightened out to where the 20,50,100 and 200 day moving averages are back in order and hence, “BEGINNING OF A BREAKOUT.”

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise.

282,2021-05-17 15:20:07,t3_nej11l,nej11l,stocks,"Retail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months. The biggest gainers in this space are DDS (Dillards) and PLCE (The Children's Place). Both could be considered boomer stocks that still rely on brick & mortar, especially Dillards. But both company's are carrying strong tailwinds from reopening and pent up demands.

PLCE has Q1 earnings coming up on May 20. PLCE mainly sells children's clothing. And I think analysts and investors are pricing in the next 4 months of growth as COVID is lifting, kids will need new clothing for summer (parties, birthdays, etc) as well as back to school in 4 months. PLCE in Q4 reported that their digital sales are up, but that they're revenues are still down. Macro factors, they're still worried about declining birth rates. Since January, PLCE is up almost 70%, mostly through reliable increasing revenues and earnings. Despite revenue not beating expectations, they're still doing well.

One thing to note with PLCE using their Q4 2020 returns: https://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/26f7ea63-8d41-481a-984d-b53f68e13032

In February 2, 2019 they made $1.9B in sales with profit of $111M.  At that time, their stock was trading at about $100. They're on track to hit that number in 2021 and even surpass it based on analyst estimates. We could see 50% more upside from PLCE if their Q1 results show anywhere near $600M in sales.

DDS is a different story. DDS just announced a $500M share buyback and a $0.15 dividend. This was on Friday. And since then, DDS has jumped almost 40%. It opened Friday at $107 and its currently trading at $142. On Friday, it was trading as low as $100 at one point.

A $500M share buyback will be done at the market:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-announces-stock-buyback-worth-%24500m-to-pay-%240.15-quarterly-dividend-2021-05-17

The dividend is payable on August for investors as of June 30.

The P/S ratios of the department store industry are between 0.28 and 0.50, with DDS being on the high side. But their revenues are increasing and with a share buyback that will lower their total float, thus decreasing their P/S, DDS could be an exciting story. The funny thing is that DDS options have spiked in IV, so I would probably buy shares to avoid any major losses due to stock dump after June 30's ex-dividend date.

If you're looking non-tech plays to diversify your portfolio, but still have some aggressive gains, PLCE and DDS may be nice additions.

Hi there I have a dilemma I need help on. I have some money to invest upwards of 50-100k for dividends stocks from recent riskier investments and I’m just wondering what is the better option in terms of yeild with the tax on American dividends being larger. One company is Canadian EIT.un. Great company, 10-11% yeild right now. Pay monthly dividend which I like hate waiting for quarterly. Have been paying same dividend for 20 years. 

Or we have ORC which pays 14-15%. Also pays monthly. Company seems solid and both have a long MR of 30% so I can margin them both the same to get my levered dividends for more gains. 

Now my question is for the math and tax experts. Since this money can’t go into a TFSA as mine is currently maxed out, what is the better play for yeild after the tax mans comes for his fair share? Love the 15% but not if is going to be a hot 8% after. Depending on my investments later on the year I should be making around 55000$ on paper but could possibly make upwards of 80-90 if all goes well.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** 

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

295,2021-05-17 16:56:07,t3_nelhgz,nelhgz,stocks,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). 

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.  

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html). 

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

This is the due diligence for those who want to round out their portfolio with an unexciting albeit profitable upstream energy stock that won a huge race for something you likely aren't even aware of: the highly profitable DJ Basin. 

BCEI's current price is 41.90, and its forecasted range is 47.00 to 66.00. [Forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BCEI), and more [forecasts](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcei/analyst-research).

Importantly, they have recently participated in a 1-for-1 with another company and I believe the market simply hasn't internalized their new size.

2021 estimated EBITDA puts them at 3.4x as last Friday's close. This is inexpensive vs the greater U.S. upstream peer group and, importantly, compares to 4.1x standalone BCEI. In other words, if the new company is simply valued in the same ballpark as BCEI alone there's significant upside, and there's nothing about the upcoming merger that should indicate a discount. In fact the opposite is the true, consolidation demands a premium.

A similar conclusion can be reached from a DCF valuation, but given the recent merger I think it's more useful to observe pre-merger 10-year free cash flow is a hair under 1 billion. The target should be 50 regardless of the merger, so depending on how you peg the risks with the merger, well, it's up to you. There is a world where BCEI is like an upstream energy company of this size and trades at 70 with a DCF like all the rest. 

**Who Should Get This Stock?**

If you're looking to get rich fast, the NBA and NHL playoffs are just around the corner and sportsbooks are taking bets 24/7. If you're looking to invest, consult with your financial advisor about BCEI. 

I invested because it is something I can forget about for a few months, and when I come back after the ex-dividend date I accept the five or six percent growth, the three percent dividend, and before I know it I'm up 50% and I want to share some good news about a stock that defines the unsexy, good business practices of upstream energy in Colorado. 

**What's BCEI?**

BCEI is a pure-play rural DJ Basin operator. ""Pure-play"" as in they focus solely on extracting oil and natural gas from Denver's Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin. The tl;dr is BCEI possesses a lot of rural Colorado acreage plus very low operating costs plus significant free cash flow. Combined, it equals it's still undervalued compared to peers in spite of the run up the last few months. 

They will also be the first net zero upstream Colorado company, using offsets to become carbon neutral. Aside from being just good stewards of the environment, they are able to do this because of the fundamentally sound structure of their company. Compared to peers they have less wellheads that make more money. In the DJ Basin, if your wellheads make a lot of money it's because they produce more oil than natural gas. Natural gas is typically put right into the atmosphere and uncaptured. Because their wellheads are more oil than wasted natural gas, they cost less than their peers and they can afford to invest in these fixed wellheads rather than running from spot to spot letting natural gas get fired off into the air. [Source](https://ibb.co/5krgsGP)

**Upside?**

The reason I love BCEI is because consolidation is the name of the game in the DJ, and they have the best chance to be the big fish that eats all the smaller fish. Whatever company is able to gobble up the other fish the fastest is going to make a lot of money, partially because the DJ Basin is already profitable and partially because increased oil prices are going to push margins up.

The reason BCEI is going to win consolidation is because they developed zero debt during the downturn, and they are already swinging their free cashflow and zero debt around in a huge way. 

They are going to combine with a smaller, more debt-heavy, competitor and the combined company, to be named Civitas, will create the largest upstream player in the DJ Basin. It's going to be a 1-for-1 merger. This follows after the outright purchase of Highpoint several months ago. [Picture of acreage](https://ibb.co/yRNSXnR)

The annual dividend of $1.40 recently announced by BCEI will be increased to $1.60 as soon as the deal closes. Notably, of the significant expected free cash flow for the combined company, the dividend, at the new higher level, only represents an annual outlay of just under $100 mm.

**Downside?**

Downside is that they go sideways, maybe lose their luster, and go back to being severely undervalued rather than their current ""normal"" of simply undervalued. This isn't financial advice, good stocks go tits up all the time. Shit happens.

**Conclusion**

What are they going to do with the rest of the cash? In the past they've played it smart buying high quality companies in their market, like HighPoint Resources, and used these synergies to grow YoY. For example last quarter, with quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share, they beat estimates of $0.73-.76 per share. Their forward looking guidance indicates continued success. Chances are there is a special dividend and/or continued consolidation, which is where the upside comes into play.","$BCEI DD -- No Moons or Rockets, Just Classic DD About an Undervalued Energy Company",,

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

Thanks",What is your process when you do your DD about a company/stock ? What are the sites / instruments that you find more useful ?,,
311,2021-05-17 20:21:09,t3_neqr5i,neqr5i,stocks,"'Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after Morgan Stanley 's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.

According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.

The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.

Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.

Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.

""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

**Highlights**

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day. 

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered. 

## Playing to win 

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,

Not really.  The ""potential"" people kept claiming was that it would be the main electric car provider and beat out everybody else, but all the major brands have brand loyalty, better infrastructure, and are poised to pump out EVs when there's actually significant demand.

Their other ""potential"" would be their self driving, which is not even close to ""full self driving"" as it is so titled.  The fact alone that it's called ""full self driving"" in its current state should be a huge red flag.  That's be like calling a roomba a personal AI assistant.  Scumbag marketing

Their other ""potential"" is their solar capabilities.  Bailing out your failing company in what many deemed an illegal move, is not a plus.

522,2021-05-17 23:02:20,t1_gyi5g2h,,stocks,"Any growth company suffers from multiple compression as interest rates (on gov. and corporate bonds) increases, because it means that lower-risk investments are paying better than they used to, relative to more risky investments (i.e. companies where most of the earnings are in the future). 

Similarly, multiple expansion is a partial explanation for the explosion in growth names we saw following the covid crash, as interest rates plummeted -- increasing the relative value of those future earnings. 

With regard to Apple specifically, it actually has $130B in debt. It took on this debt because the interest rate is low, so it can use this money to buy back its own shares, on the assumption that its earnings will grow much faster than the interest rate on that debt. This allows Apple to increase its earnings per share, even through years where its earnings don't increase much (between major phone cycles, for example), with minimal financial risk. If interest rates increase significantly, Apple will no longer be able to employ this strategy.",,gyi5g2h,t1_gyi2749

It could be argued that the only reason the USA didn't end up in the same cold war dead end the Soviet Union experienced is because it had transitioned to development of software.  Why?  Software in inherently deflationary and offsets and inherently inflationary monetary policy.  One of the key components to this dynamic is the exemption of software from any sort of legal liability.  

When software is employed in a manner that makes life or death decisions for human beings on a daily, common man level, that liability exemption will evaporate.

Beyond that, there's this fundamental failure of understand what is being ""disintermediated"".  Float.  That is what is being disintermediated.  There is a *remarkable* percentage of capital market investment that comes directly from insurance industry float.  Removal of that float will be devastating for the capital markets.

You can yell about past performance but does that dictate future performance? Try to make that case please. The idea that everyone can turn their car into a self-driving taxi. That's the biggest garbage I've heard in the world and yet all the Tesla cult members ate it up like it was the golden goose.

I'm willing to listen but nothing I've seen from Tesla suggests they are way ahead on technology. They will also have a lot of trouble as more establish participants enter the market. Just look at VW's commitment to producing more EVs.

Any other major auto company can outcompete Tesla on product today. I guarantee you this because I've been working in Auto for 12 year and specifically I have worked in the EV industry (before Model S was even released). I've actually been at a company that provided some proposals to Tesla on motor testing. Their engineers basically balked because in the end Tesla did not want to test their powertrains to a standard that actually makes sense for long term quality.

1. Software has no capabilities of choosing who will die or live in a near-sighted accident situations. - Legal issue.
2. Switching too fast to self-driving will destroy a piece of chains in capitalist economy (insurance industry will be slinmed), which can collapse the economy partially.

To encounter point 1, I think we can eliminate human driving in the near future. By using central HD spatial data and install more IoT sensors ( geo fence, smart traffic control), we can achieve near 100% non human driving. The 5G will be crucial here. But there will be way less traffic, less accident, less death). With enough proves ( death rate statically), most of us will switch to full self driving car if it is free.

To encounter point 2, I think car insurance companies do not contribute to the growth of society. If I remember correctly, they even lobby the lawmaker to mandate this driver must have insurance law. Most of the car insurance is leeches, they go full internet already, they don't promote local job growth

But many of the high flying tech stocks of last year (Etsy, Snap, Pinterest) are also rans in their respective sectors. Others like Twilio are relatively niche players - their USP is rather narrow despite what their bulls say. I think the promise of tech over the last ten years has either been realized in some cases or been shown not to exist. We were bound for a shakeout, interestingly enough, Covid probably helped many of these companies delay their reckoning for a year. 

You could see it at work. My last three companies hired for growth 2017-2019,  but that growth never materialized and they all would have laid off in 2020 Covid or not.

Employing software, which is inherently flawed, for the task of piloting vehicles in which natural person has typically been assigned legal liability means that software will assume that legal liability and this removal of liability prohibition will translate to **all** software. 

> To encounter point 1,

I'm going to assume that English is a second language.  Software is flawed.  Data is incomplete and inaccurate.  Connectivity is spotty and highly latent at best.  You are chasing a pipe dream.  Mixing software piloted vehicles into a massive population of natural person driven vehicles means that all the algorithmic perfection in the world will not prevent software piloted vehicles from having their occupants killed.  Obvious situations were imperfect software results in humans dying at the ""hands"" of said software will not allow the natural person piloted vehicles to be blamed and will result in software liability becoming standard tort law.

> I think car insurance companies do not contribute to the growth of society.

They contribute **HEAVILY** to the capital markets and are an inherent part of growth and societal progress.

I feel more confident in buying Apple cause I have a long history of realized and unrealized gains with this stock. I’ve probably traded it dozens of times and by some miracle always been able to get in at a lower price than where I sold except for one time, which was when stocks sold off in March 2020. I could have gotten in lower but a “friend” convinced me that the sell off was nowhere close to over and I waited too long before buying back in. 

I currently have a January 2023 LEAPS in ICLN that I’m down 70% on (-$830). It was ITM when I bought it but it was really bad timing, right when all the clean energy and growth stocks started crashing. I thought I was buying the dip but it just kept dipping. Luckily it’s the smallest LEAPS I ever bought and it’s not a big portion of my portfolio but it is still annoying. I’m just going to hold in case it comes back. It needs to get back to $32 in order to just break even, which I guess isn’t totally out of the question, so I don’t think all hope is lost just yet.

I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to drop lower but now that it's lower than its reference point of 250, I think it might be at fair value for right now. But there are some major risks and uncertainty. Competitors that offer better deals and more coins will likely go public as well and bring competition COIN probably can't handle. I think as crypto market continues to grow, coin will definitely gain apart of that growth, however I really can't see any coin being mass adopted until a few years out, maybe a bit sooner.

Elon is definitely not helping right now. Most people still think all crypto is a scam and worthless, it'll take a while before most people even understand what blockchains are and what they're used for.

Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.",,gyika59,t3_ner6xo

I think thats a big reason behind this 20 billion investment they did they see the demand and product availability for the next decade being problematic... idk in my opinion AMD not being more into producing their own chips is going to catch up to them and lead to major revenue set backs from Intel long term,,gyim29r,t1_gyijkxn

You should realize that as long as Theranos was able to court a $9 billion dollar evaluation on pure speculation that their mouse trap was going to be leagues ahead of competitors based on words from a CEO, Tesla can be definitely valued at some crazy market cap too. It's whether or not the mass delusion has been figured out yet.

Even at today's value the share price can't be rationalized. It's purely cult of personality and the illusion of potential continued EV leadership and growth.

I've been working in Auto for 12 years and have been at a leading firm within the EV industry. Tesla has nothing that any other major manufacturer cannot do. They were first yes but a money making machine they are not. 

Also, Tesla cannot compete at scale by producing better cars. 

They provide worst quality cars at the behest of speed to manufacture. They absolutely oversell on what it does today (Autopilot) and continues to sell a feature that will likely never come to market (Level 5 autonomous) on their current hardware because it'd be incapable of actually meeting regulatory standards of the future.

-$PRPL: still not really profitable. High P/E around 400?... Financials are okay for growth, don’t seem to be drowning in debt and is improving.
However according to reviews, really nice quality product with a strong patent on the tech. Expanding and look to be making decent money in a couple years. Innovative with products.

-$SNBR: stronger financials except for debt/assets. Good cash flow and a much more reasonable valuation (P/e ~19)
Reviews seem to have taken a downturn lately and the product doesn’t seem to be expanding.

- $TPX: good financials relatively speaking. Cash flow is certainly there and not a huge burden of debt relative to assets and cash flow. P/e also around 19. Even pay a dividend of .72%. 
Products range from low to high end, and demand is certainly there on both sides. Innovation seems to be there but not the strongest from what I can see.

I never heard of LEAPS before that and what's weird is like 6 months later they were being talked about all over the place like reddit and youtube. Ironically if I had gone all in right away I would have made a killing lol. I was considering doing them with ""safe"" stocks like apple, disney, IBB, SPY, QQQ, etc. 

I've learned reddit can be a great contrary indicator. The reddit hivemind is usually wrong based on the principle of being ""greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". A lot of new investors pile into the trends and don't really know what they're talking about. 

My stock portfolio is only down like 4% from it's ATH so I feel like I'm doing pretty well. I never got too into the meme type stocks but put in maybe less than 5% of my portfolio into stocks like NIO and ICLN.

Something goes up 20% and you only see a small blip. Your average position is about $235  (3,300 in 14 positions) so a %20 gain on that would be a $47 gain. 

I started the same way. I've got an IRA that you can only put $6,000 a year. Over the last 6 years it's grown well, nothing crazy. I try to stick to the steady names as much as possible.

But after a while I thought it was smart to have about $5,000 in each position. I hated seeing a stock do really well and only make peanuts like my example above.

20% gain on $5,000 is $1,000....And of course the down days can be bigger. But if you pick the right ones you should go from bottom left to upper right.

You can try to pin blame on whatever you want in 2007, but ultimately that was a tailspin from a liquidity binge that started with massive monetary easing after 9/11. They tried to reign it in and the banks that were leveraged to the hilt got shaken out. The banks are not as leveraged, but there are massive asset bubbles out there today. Bitcoin is currently worth more than JPM, GS and XOM combined. Come on. Will it pop tomorrow? Probably not, but I've staked my bet on oil because it is a highly price inelastic commodity that takes off when the economy is hot and the money supply explodes like it did in the post 9/11 era. The Fed sees the house of cards and isn't going to pump the brakes until inflation really heats up. It will be interesting to see if they can buy yields down indefinitely, though.

I don't want too great of a percent of my portfolio to be in one stock, but I'll buy it one more time if we see another significant dip.  If that were to happen I would probably go for a cheaper but more risky call with a higher strike. For example, if it dipped to 100 I might buy a strike of 125 which should be really cheap if that were to happen. Because at that point I think it would have dipped so much that it would have a really good chance of seeing a recovery.

For a SpaceX Falcon 9, the rocket used to access the ISS, the cost is just $2,720 per kilogram.

It's possible that NewCo (in which you will receive some equity) will pay a dividend that makes up the difference, but I think the general consensus *at the moment* is that that is unlikely given that they'll need to reinvest a large portion of their FCF into the business to generate content to grow and gain subscribers.

So, it's still a ways off to know exactly (a) how many shares of NewCo you will receive per share of T, (b) what exactly T will cut their dividend to, (c) whether NewCo will pay a dividend, and if so, how much per share.

Whether you sell is completely up to you. I've got 200 shares of T, and I'm still sorting through what I want to do.

You say you're long on these positions but you're stressing about one week! Take your time. Delete the app if you need to. 

My advice is this: 

If you're investing long term think about what companies are set up to rule the world long term. Those are the companies you should invest in. 

If they have a bad week, a bad quarter, or a bad year....so what? That means you're getting them on sale. Good for you. 

I advise you to listen to the earnings calls. That'll tell you what the future looks like for the company. I also advise you to invest in companies you understand.

The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but are coming off a technical breakdown to the 50 day that consolidated into earnings. 

If you look at the EPS revisions from TSE in their earnings call slide presentation from May 6th the estimated Adjusted EPS for 2021 are 9.12-10.14 vs. analysts are outdated and as low as $4, which they already made this year 🧐, and one gave a $10.04. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75 and today at $69.39.

There’s more...TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% is insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. Now here’s what I don’t understand but find very interesting...how can there be 928,500 shares short with 2.3 days to cover and only 1.16m float? Can someone explain this?Aside from this interesting point I like the stock; not stock advice. 

https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=TSE

TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math, the revisions will be HUGE and this stock might be worth $90/share range relative to 10x earnings. This is not stock advice. I would be interested if anyone can explain the short interest to float here. Either way TSE seems like a lagger in the space with strong operating leverage and strong eps.

1313,2021-05-18 06:01:00,t1_gyjen23,,stocks,"Let's simplify the issue to a basic example. This is usually a good way to get the crux of the question.

Let's say I establish a shell company and I contribute 100k in cash to shareholder equity. Nothing else. If I were to sell this shell company, I would always receive 100k for that company, as it has 100k in cash in assets and 100k in shareholder equity (let's not assume transactional costs, value of the name or anything else, let's just look at the balance sheet). Any owner could immediately reduce the equity by 100k and pay himself 100k in cash. Therefore the company is worth 100k. Owning the company is essentially the same as owning 100k in cash.

Now let's say that instead I use the company to buy back 50% of the shares from me for 50k. I will receive 50k in cash, the company receives 50% of its shares. If I were now to sell the company, I would get 50k for it, as the company has 50k in cash in assets and 50k in equity. The fact that the company could sell 50% of its shares means nothing for its valuation. Just as the technical fact, that the company could raise 1M or 1B does not make the shell company worth 1M or 1B. If it did raise 1B in cash, yes its valuation would go to 1B, but not just because it owns its own shares.

If in this example the company had retained its valuation of 100k after buying back 50% of its shares for 50k, I would have just made 50k out of thin air. As I physically received 50k for selling my shares to the company, yet still own the entire company. It's not logical that I just increased my wealth by doing nothing else than exchange shares with my own company.

Honestly this is beyond ludicrous where this sub has gotten to. If a company uses its cash to decrease share holder equity, thereby returning wealth to its shareholders, fundamentally the valuation of the company goes down. How could anyone think it wouldn't? If a company pays dividend from its cash, their valuation goes down. If a company pays wages to its employees, the valuation of the company goes down. It's a cost to the company. Money leaving the company. It's a 1-1 change between cash outflow and valuation.

Now, obviously investor sentiment and other factors not fundamentally tied to the balance sheet of the company have an effect on valuations on a stock market. Raising cash could scare away previous investors or it could create stronger belief in its growth. Paying investors through dividends or share buybacks could both improve the return on assets or it could put the company in trouble (liquidity issues, hamper growth etc). But what I am assuming here is that board decisions regarding capital allocations are (near) optimal and marginal changes in capital structure do not have a fundamental underlying impact on the company. All that changes is cash on hand.",,gyjen23,t1_gyhqcz2
