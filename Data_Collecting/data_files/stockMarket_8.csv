The criticisms of DOGE are everywhere and ETC has been subject to past attacks.

Instead of ETC, go with ETH or ADA. Instead of DOGE, how about DOT or LINK. Project with actual use cases and also allow for staking to generate passive income.

Just know, when you are doing research this is exactly how people conclude their data. They find bunch of numbers and analyze it to find multiple answers.

I think 3 years is a good time frame, 1 year might be more conclusive as it would include before, conception and during the abusive illegal naked shorting/FTD cycle.

49,,2021-05-24 04:24:28,t3_njpfwg,,StockMarket,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

The stock market is facing the same problem. Why put money where it loses value? This is where it gets scary: the stock market is already at ATH levels and has been seeing insane gains. It‚Äôs not merely a stock market problem, but an ECONOMIC one. 

This happened because the inflation rate spiked and is still poised to go up. The S&P however is skittish due to already Low IR and the many indicators of a major correction coming soon (eg ATH margin debt). This combo resulted in the large decrease in inflation-adjusted gains. There‚Äôs not much they can do to curb either.

Reducing IR to stabilise inflation will result in a stock market correction. The fed has committed to print trillions per month til year end, inflation is going crazy while productivity is stagnant due to covid. What do we do bois.",,

As with all things im life, with time I will learn more and understand these coins for their uses and real world applications. As for the butt hurt thing well let's just say I wasn't offended. I was just shocked that people still had this snarky, I know better than you attitude towards others still. I came to reddit for the subs on the market because I feel have come as far as I can at the moment and am interested in new opportunities and the varying points of view on positions I am contemplating especially when doing research about new investments. But the point is I am not offended, I am a just a little taken back by the reluctance to help and the quickness with which you jumped on me . I am here to learn and help and will always do my best to help where I can. And I think that's the difference between us.

You have been day trading in the volatile crypto market, made a lot of money as it rose, then lost a lot as it fell.  Some questions to ask yourself are:

1) Will you be happier and sleep better if you cash out now and take a break from investing?

2)  If you want to keep investing, would you prefer going into something  traditionally safe and stable, like an S&P 500 ETF ?

2) If you want to keep investing in crypto, do you believe crypto is going to go up or down over the next 12 months?  If you think it is going down, then best wait for that to happen before investing again.

  Over the last 12 yrs of amateur trading and selling shares I have lost roughly 165k in cash. One of those particular times bout 3 yrs ago a company I was 45k deep in went into liquidation and It put me into a 3 month stint of depression. Was scary shit ! 
Anyways what I'm getting at and over the years with what I have learnt by my own experience is that the hardest thing for me personally was to ""SELL"" a stock cause the profit I had envisioned in my head or believed In was just not quite there yet - but see the thing is that when your influenced or emotionally attatched or maybe just the little bit to greedy to set a bench mark for sell and reap the benefits of making a minor profit as opposed to becoming Baller status over night then that's when you realise - your just a mug that's realistically sitting around waiting for days / weeks like these to be caught out holding the empty bag.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

It is a common tactic to underprice 1 aspect to over charge on other
They could be making money loaning my stocks out for margin trading
They make money off my money market account ( where you money is held before buying anything) 
I do not use a rep nor can I ( that is a paid service) 
They will charge for options ( as stated ealier )
They do charge for bond ( as stated ealier)
And I have read the rest of that doc before I signed the paper funny your arguing when you haven't read it
If they are making anything of my trades or I creasing price it is at least 6 decimals back
It seems like you can only see this in a very linear light my suggestions is to go read all 100 pages actually learn about the account
Maybe if you learn a little more about it you can tell me exactly how they are making the money ( hell you can give me the page and I'll read it myself to ) until then it seems like you really don't care you just don't like the idea of these accounts ( idk maybe you see it as a handout or something or maybe you can't grasp that they can give a little and receive more with other products ) this is how online trading is going now though maybe not permanently but for one you have all the Information if you take the time to look

Besides crying and asking a lot of questions, what are you doing for yourself? Have you read any books?  Have you googled how to screen stocks?  Do you know the different types of stocks?  Do you have an interest in options, forex, futures? You don't? How do you know?

Have you opened a forex account and used the Mt4 platform with a chart you saw on Youtube? Spent 10 hrs on that chart to understand why it will or won't work?  Do you know what the term 'screen time' really means when it comes to trading?  Because that one, that one's gonna hurt son. You will lose friendships because of that one.  Do you know about support and resistance, divergences, etc?

Awe screw it. Let me tell you why someone would tell you to just buy crypto...because crypto has been trending then exploding! And now it's correcting and doing a pullback, which smart people take advantage of.  You can also buy in when it's trending, it's that simple.

I am not claiming in a certain recent short squeeze attempt that the big whales in there heavily sold stocks to each other back and forth to drive down the price, but considering Kramer talked about this as effective tactic back in 2006 to drive down a price and that the Flash Crash was caused by a similar action (spamming thousands of sell orders per second to make it seem like a huge sell off and adjusting them several times a second) also fits into this.

If you are a whale on anything you will sooner or later get into a group that will strategize on what to do. And no whale sells off 50% of their holding, this would panic crash the market. Whales hold usually 40-60% of a crypto market (combined). Instead you drip sell your position, starting really small at 0.5-1% and work your way up. That's why it's so effective to follow wallet transactions of certain whales. The moment this starts and continues for several days, get the hell out. The final big sell will then cause a huge landslide and it's usually done by several at once.",,

The time you have waiting for that dollar to grow just feels like you would be better off spending your time for other things. The only video I could find of ""low amount to high amount"" was [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkvt6FEyCTk&t=447s). Apparently he says he goes from a starting balance of $50 to $2000 and the last video I could find of this was week three, which was [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn3X0RtOXqg). It looks like he's doing calls and options and all that, which to me shows that even $50 dollars would be too slow to make any noticeable gains at all, so he has to resort to doing those, which he ends up going down every week.  


That was the only video I could find of ""low amount to high amount"".. I would like to believe anybody can start in with one dollar, fifty bucks, or hell even 100 bucks and work their way up without putting a single cent in afterwards, as that would be incredible.

Furthermore, to list its physical characteristics as purely an advantage against other stores of wealth is a shallow and puerile argument.

Its transparent, digital immutability allows it to stand in a court of law.

You've fallen for just about all of the dumbest arguments from uninformed crypto critics. I've already listed out some of the use cases (trustless peer to peer transfers, hedge against inflation, security, transparency, simplicity, ease of use etc) and you go to the ""it's utterly useless except for criminals and thieves"" trope. \*facepalm\*. Do you realize when the internet first came out, luddites such as yourself argued that its only useful for scammers and pedos? I guarantee these same people are using the internet these days. I suppose cars are bad too, because they allow rapists to get around and do their deed and quickly get away. I guess roads are bad too, because they enable the cartel's transfer and distribution of drugs. Guess what, the majority terrorism, money laundering, and other illicit activities are funded by USD and facilitated through banks. So when are you going to stop using USD and the internet?

Invoking the great depression as the argument FOR government backed fiscal policy? Wow, now I've heard everything. Failures of the central bank and the government's interventionist policies are exactly what BTC goes against. People who had money in the stock market and banks lost everything. That's what happens when you centralize power to the few at the top. Technology has allowed us to now have a trustless, incorruptible system governed by code.

We also like the memes, just like how we see the same memes posted here all the time. 

So far, most of our predictions have come true, such as stock prices tanking and the crypto market being pumped and then tanking for liquidity. The most important factor though, is the current share price. The narrative they have been pushing for 5 months is simply not true. Every day they say it will tank, and it doesn‚Äôt... the rest of the market might, but not GME.",,

You clearly don‚Äôt even understand what a luddite is. I am about the biggest proponent of automation out there. Hell, I even started a blog about it years ago. I don‚Äôt believe for 1 second that tech automation takes away jobs. Quite the opposite is true.

Crypto is not even remotely comparable. It is not this revolutionary tech you proclaim it to be. It‚Äôs only true redeeming quality is in immediate transfers of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (something actual currencies will be doing in the near future, and practically already do to a large extent) yet it‚Äôs not a currency and would never hold up as one. It‚Äôs too instable thanks to a foolish design of capped supply. Being divisible is irrelevant. What matters is that limited supply with a growing population and growing economies will mean price instability. Who the fuck wants an economy where your monthly wages can only buy a burger the following year?? And again, currencies are created by governments, not individuals in their garages.

‚Äúhedge against inflation‚Äù - it is FAR too volatile to ever succeed at this, and it lacks any true inherent value or government backing.

‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù - tell that to the people who lost all their bitcoin after they lost a harddrive, had their account hacked, etc. At least my bank account is FDIC insured and my credit cards can be contested when some thief uses my account. If you had crypto, you‚Äôre fucked. You can‚Äôt proclaim that it‚Äôs both private/anonymous and secure. If nobody knows whose ‚Äúmoney‚Äù it actually is, then once it‚Äôs lost or stolen, you‚Äôre screwed.

‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù??? Nobody knows who owns what bitcoin. This is why criminals love it! That‚Äôs the opposite of transparency.

‚ÄúSimplicity, ease of use‚Äù - horseshit. My dollars are faaaar easier to use. Atms at every corner. Apps to transfer money anywhere at any time. Usable at any store vs <.1% of stores with crypto. It‚Äôs not even compatable: dollars are faaar more simple to use.

My argument was NOT that because criminals and thieves use them, it must be bad. My argument is that the only actual added utility for such is for criminals and thieves. Everyone else already has normal currency, which criminals can‚Äôt use so easily since it IS actually transparent. Terrorists often used things like diamonds and had to go through tons of difficult money laundering to succeed in transfering money. With crypto, it has been made far too easy to bypass the law.

Yes, you have a lot to learn about fiscal policy and money supply. You‚Äôre just the latest incarnation of anti-government gold bug nut jobs. /shrug",,

1. **Economic** **Data**

\- FOMC minutes showed more board members started to consider reducing the amount of bond purchase program

\- Economic data showed signs of cooling down

**2. Rates**

\- Not much movement in the rates market

\- Yield curve flattened modestly

**3. Equities**

\- Volatility remained high

\- Market divided on whether value or growth

**4. Other** **Markets**

\- Commodity prices continued to stabilize

\- Cryptocurrencies saw large corrections with Bitcoin down more than 20% and Ethereum down near 40%

\- USD/CAD closed at1.206, the lowest level since 2015

*Processing img khjvnvikb2171...*

**What** **You** **Need** **to** **Know**

1. **U.S. government to reduce infrastructure plan from $2.3 trillion to $1.7 trillion**

\- White House lowers proposed spending on highways and broadband and shifts some programs into other legislation.

\- The proposed $1.7 trillion plan is still well above the Republican lawmakers‚Äô $568 billion offer.

\- In our opinion, this negotiation is still far from the end and the spending is likely to go down further to meet the Republican‚Äôs demand.

\- Infrastructure and basic material stocks will be likely to start adjusting to this information.

\- Inflation expectation driven by the spending will likely cool down.

**2. Global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%**

\- A U.S. proposal for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15% met with an enthusiastic reception in Europe.

\- It touched on how much multinationals pay, and to which governments.

\- Multinational corporations have been using countries with lower corporate tax rates, such as Ireland, as tax shelters for years.

\- Some obstacles remain, including disagreement on the treatment of technology companies such as Facebook and Google.

\- In our opinion, if countries ultimately came to an agreement to impose this tax change, it will create short-term volatility in the stock market. However, we believe the risk will only be short-term because governments will open other windows to compensate corporations for the tax change and this action also tells us businesses are still growing which is a bullish signal for equities.

**3. Long-term returns on Forex are nearly zero**

\- Studies showed there is no point in investing in Forex because returns are near zero.

\- Forex pairs, such as USDCAD and USDEUR, trade-in ranges which mean reversion trading is a better strategy than buy-and-hold.

How to beat the market is one of the hottest topics among investment professionals and retail investors. Beating the market is like winning the NBA championship, it puts a halo on the investor or analyst. During my research, it seems like almost all open sources talk about the ability to pick outperforming stocks as the most important factor in a market-beating strategy. As a finance professional, a former trader at an investment bank, I‚Äôm telling you that is not true and there are many other strategies that can help you to beat the market, even if you don‚Äôt know how to pick stocks. Moreover, stock-picking isn‚Äôt for everybody because it is very time-consuming and requires extensive knowledge in finance. In this article, I will explain the pros and cons for a retail investor to focus on picking stocks and one of the many other methods, I personally use, that can help you to beat the market without picking stocks. 

**How hard is it to beat the market?**

According to Forbes, a study by Vanguard, an American investment company with AUM over 6 trillion dollars, found that only 18% of active mutual fund managers beat their benchmarks over a 15-year period. Of these outperforming managers, 97% of them experienced underperformance for at least 5 years, more than 60% experienced 7 or more years of underperformance, and 66% of these star managers underperformed for 3 or more consecutive years. These managers are highly educated, have many years of experience in the financial markets, working over 10 hours a day, it is very surprising to see only a small fraction of fund managers can beat the market in the long term and this fact also tells us how hard it is to beat the market consistently.

**Why stock-picking is not for everybody?**

First, compare yourself to these active mutual fund managers and ask yourself the following questions: are you smarter than them? Can you work harder than them? Do you have more knowledge about the financial market than them? If most of these managers cannot beat the market, why can you? Stock-picking requires a lot of time and industry knowledge. For an average retail investor, assuming this investor has a full-time job, it is very hard to find the time to learn and perform due diligence in order to screen for potential outperforming stocks unless this investor has 48 hours in a day and gets free RedBulls.

Secondly, diversification can be tough for retail investors who try to pick stocks for their portfolios. If an investor wants to reduce his or her portfolio risk by diversification, he or she will have to sacrifice some returns because risk and expected return generally have a positive relationship. If the investor decides to have more concentrated positions to boost up the return, then his or her portfolio risk will go up as well. For example, imagine you have $10,000 to invest, how many holdings are you going to have in your portfolio? 3 or 10? If you choose to hold only 3 stocks, your portfolio risk is probably through the roof, and you should be ready for it. If you choose to hold 10 stocks, do you have the time and energy to perform due diligence on these 10 companies and follow their every action? My point is, holding single names is not the optimal way to construct portfolios for retail investors who lack time and financial backgrounds.

**What should we do?**

In my opinion, broad-market index ETFs, such as SPY, are better for the kind of investor that I mentioned above. But you might ask, how can you beat the market by buying the market if we assume S&P 500 is our benchmark? The answer is to hold SPY and sell covered calls.

**What is a covered call?**

A covered call is a strategy where an investor sells call options and owns an equivalent amount of the underlying asset. For example, you have 100 shares of SPY and sell 1 contract of SPY call (1 contract = 100 shares).

Let me briefly explain how options are priced. Generally, we can explain option pricing based on the following formula:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a0qatxh7h2171.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd2e93c18884ea7a5ebbf527cd9747c57bf0021

Don‚Äôt be frightened by this giant formula. All you need to know are the factors that impact the price of a call option:

1. Spot price of the stock: the higher the spot price, the higher the price of a call option

2. Strike price: the lower the strike price, the higher the price of the call option

3. Time to maturity: the longer the time to maturity, the higher the price

4. Volatility of the stock: the higher volatility, the higher the price

One thing that we need to pay attention to is when the spot price exceeds the strike price of the call option, our shares get taken away. So, this strategy puts a cap on our potential returns but reduces our portfolio risk at the same time, remember the price of the call falls when the underlying stock falls, and we are shorting the call options meaning we gain when the price of the call falls. Therefore, the key to this strategy is to choose a strike price that can both maximize our return and have a reasonably low probability of getting exceeded. A pay-off diagram for covered call strategy is shown below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/61scxtcch2171.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6ede26272c416caa1954ffc75eaf1290277de5

**How does the strategy work?**

Let me demonstrate the application of this strategy with a real-life example.

https://preview.redd.it/yivme2jgh2171.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=3000096b043c95d11bbd880be9f70d2f888e2805

The above call options expire on January 21, 2022, which is approximately 8 months from now. If we buy 100 shares of SPY at the current spot price, $416.97/share, and sell a call option contract at 10 cents/contract with a strike price of 575, your portfolio return on the day of expiry would be the return on SPY + 10 cents x 100 shares if the spot price of SPY does not go above the strike price.

Choosing the right strike price is the key to this strategy because the strike price has to exceed the amount of management fee charged by SPY and maximize your result. The way I do it is to analyze the following 2 scenarios:

1. Normal stance

The market is in an upward trend and has not experienced any big corrections in the past 12 months. The chart should look like the following. 

https://preview.redd.it/0o5dhbvnh2171.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=649b8a84d7c3297628b6823fdddff87201ebbacc

 In this scenario, I would choose to sell the call option with a strike price that is equal to 10% (annualized return of SPY) plus 5% (I choose 5% as my ‚Äòbuffer‚Äô because I would be happy to sell SPY 5% above the annualized return, it can vary based on investor‚Äôs expectation), above the current spot price. If we take the current spot price of $416.97 and add 15%, it will give me $479.52 which rounds to $480. The highlighted call option in the image below has a strike price of 480 and expires on June 17, 2022, which is approximately one year from now. The premium for this specific call option is $6.25, which is approximately 1.50% of the current spot price of SPY. 

https://preview.redd.it/vvb9rxirh2171.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=768df8085fdc7dcfc4baaf9b7f25a2c2c38d0944

 According to Yahoo Finance, SPY charges an annual management fee of 0.09%. So, we take 1.50% that we earn from selling the call option and minus the 0.09% charged by SPY, then we have 1.41% left. 

*Processing img ewi3y9tth2171...*

 Remember, we still must deduct trading fees charged by the broker in order to calculate the final return. For the broker I use, they charge me $10/trade plus $10/contract, which is $20 in total for this trade. The return that we make from selling this call option is 416.97/share x 100 shares x 1.41% = $587.94. So, in the end, we can make $587.94 - $20 = $567.94, which is 1.36%. So, if the spot price of SPY does not exceed 480 on June 17, 2022, our portfolio will outperform S&P 500 by 1.36% (assume the tracking error of SPY is near 0). Do you think 1.36% is too little? Let me show you how much value an extra 1.36% return can add to your portfolio. 

*Processing img 3fkksgwvh2171...*

https://preview.redd.it/tkuhmfkyh2171.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0514095b47fb57ef3642044ae9ea5ffbf3723f8

2. Recovering stance

The market is recovering from a sharp drop. The chart should look like the following. 

https://preview.redd.it/1biky3a1i2171.png?width=276&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f1490f15ae533d2c3eda55480ba9af72fa5b89a

If this happens, just like in March 2020 when the COVID outbreak started, I will hold my positions and perhaps buy more with the money I made from selling call options previously. If my call options happen to expire during this downturn, I would not roll into new expiries because the strength of rebound is hard to predict. Again, we want to minimize the chance that the spot price goes above the strike price.

**Conclusion**

By using the covered-call strategy on broad-market index ETF like SPY, you will have a higher probability of beating the market than picking stocks and lower your portfolio risk at the same time. The only time that you will underperform the market is when the market is stronger than you expect, meaning the spot price at expiry exceeds the strike price.

But let me be clear, this is not a perfect strategy. As I mentioned above, a risk to this strategy is your potential return being limited by the strike price you choose. Another thing that we need to keep in mind, option prices vary from time to time due to changes to the factors that I mentioned previously. With that being said, the return is not guaranteed.

Hopefully, this article can help you become the ‚Äòmarket beater‚Äô that you always dream of.

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?**

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/nsplxyohk2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=db044c0fd63d2bf2396e095e5bc306489204a4d4

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/eze2j12jk2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0351d45013eb9bb4be06a43ac2e4ef1254d23088

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

*Processing img 54n0nmokk2171...*

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

if you do want to trade or invest in crypto then do some reading, watch some videos, maybe take some notes and understand the market, know what you‚Äôre investing in. and if you only have $25 to start with then that‚Äôs better than nothing so great but just so you know you‚Äôre not really gonna make much money at all with that amount. currently prices for btc and eth (while they are dipping, they) are still extremely high in price and trading volume. this makes every other coin kinda follow their lead for the most part. and if you want to trade newer, cheap coins so you can buy a ton of them in hopes that they blow up and you can see massive returns instead of 20% on a huge day you could be seeing hundreds of % or thousands if you get in early enough. BUT the catch is with every swap between exchanges or coin and any transaction there‚Äôs a fee or gas which can make this very expensive. gas is sometimes up to $70, sometimes even higher, sometimes as low as $5 i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs usually under $20. so you have to be spending a few hundred for it to really count. but if you put $15 into bitcoin which is around $35,000, your money isn‚Äôt going to move much. it‚Äôll have to spike to $70k for you to get $30. and that‚Äôs unrealistic. if you have say $100 in $ELON or something and it goes from .0000001 to .0000004 then you‚Äôd have 400.

""Most likely"" based on what? Any legitimate brokerage will have access to all of the shares their customers own and they won't co-mingle them with their own investments. When a brokerage goes bankrupt, they lose their own assets, not their customers.

The SIPC only comes into play when the brokerage is doing something illegal, like the case with Bernie Madoff which has been the biggest one handled by the SIPC by far.

You also need to realize that the $500k limit isn't the highest limit (some brokerages pay for higher limits) and that the $500k pays for shortfalls in what the brokerage owes you. So for example if you have $5M in assets at a brokerage that fails and they are able to return 90% of that (which is common), then the $500k will make you whole at $5M again.

I highly recommend reading through an SIPC annual report to get a better idea of how they work. You seem to be misunderstanding a lot of it.

BlackBerry is in the process of transforming itself from a hardware company to a software company. Back in the day, BlackBerry was once a dominating player in the smartphone industry but soon their market share had been taken by Android and iPhone. Since then, the company has been struggling and trying to transform its business strategy to be software-focused. Today, 98% of BlackBerry‚Äôs revenue comes from software and services, comparing to only 3% in 2014. During this transformation, their revenue and profits have been declining year over year, its profitability has been shredded into pieces. The company has just released its 2020 results and showed that its revenue and profitability have deteriorated once again, with revenue declined by 14% comparing with the previous year and a loss of $1.97 per share. The market is so bearish on the stock but we think otherwise, this might be the darkest before the dawn.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bsdzdl2s43171.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=19aef3294d6530efbc24f180f2e0ffa7fae1ad2a

QNX

BlackBerry QNX is a real-time operating system (RTOS). RTOS is an operating system that serves real-time applications with real-time data. It‚Äôs targeted to solve problems as it goes. The difference between RTOS and traditional OS that we are using daily, such as iPhone IOS, Windows, and Android is that RTOS will not crash if something goes wrong with the system. For example, when the Windows operating system encounters an error, it will shut itself down and gives us a blue screen. If an RTOS runs into the same problem, it will bypass it and won‚Äôt shut itself down. This is useful in many applications, such as autonomous driving. Imagine your car‚Äôs operating system shuts down while self-driving, the result can be catastrophic. 

The EV market, as we all know, is growing rapidly. According to IHS Markit, the total sales of EV globally is around 2.5 million cars in 2020 and they expect it to grow by 70% in 2021. They also said global sales will top 12.2 million cars in 2025, indicating annual growth of nearly 52% (compounded). By 2021, China and Europe will account for the largest market shares, with China at about 44% and Europe at about 28%. Then North America with 16% and a combined share of 11% for Japan and South Korea. The EV market and autonomous driving technology seem to be growing together, autonomous driving features are more common in EVs than traditional cars. And the amount of effort and money required to develop a reliable operating system is too much, that many automakers will consider adopting an existing platform like the QNX rather than developing their own. With that being said, the user base of the QNX operating system will increase exponentially as the EV market grows.

The QNX operating system doesn‚Äôt just work on cars, it can also work on smart home appliances and even smart city infrastructures. As of today, there are more than 175 million cars on roads that use the QNX operating system. 

Ivy

BlackBerry Ivy is a cloud-connected software platform, joined force with Amazon‚Äôs AWS, that allows automakers to create personalized experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with QNX and AWS technology. In simple terms, this is a data-collecting platform that collects vehicle and driving data from all cars operating under QNX. This is a very powerful service that can help BlackBerry‚Äôs partners make better products and improve sales. BlackBerry‚Äôs plan is to roll it out sometime in 2022.

Spark

BlackBerry Spark is a product that utilizes AI, machine learning, and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention. Cybersecurity is the company‚Äôs strength and the market is growing at a high speed. According to Forbes, the global cybersecurity market is currently worth $173 billion in 2020, and growing to $270B by 2026 (7.2% annual growth rate). We expect it to grow faster than 7.2%, given we are more dependent on the internet and computers than ever, and frictions between nations are getting worse. The recent SolarWinds incident has rung the warning bell to all of us, cybersecurity is crucial for every nation, business, and individual.

Sale of Patent

BlackBerry is selling patents that are no longer relevant to them. We think this is a good move by the management. Recycling some of the capital and resources and put it somewhere more productive. The CEO, John Chen, said in the earnings call that they are in talks to sell some of their hardware and wireless network patents to a North American party and the deal is likely to go through in 2021. 

Conclusion

Despite the declining revenue and EPS, we are optimistic about BlackBerry. We need to keep in mind that the company is undergoing a complete transformation, from a hardware focus to a software focus, the management has been great at executing their plan. The company has positioned itself in 2 of the fast-growing industries, EV and cybersecurity, both as industry leaders with good market share. We expect BlackBerry‚Äôs growth to pick up in 2022 and onwards.

Our style

We are focusing on long-term investments with a time horizon of 5 years or longer. We care more about future growth potential than current valuations. BlackBerry is a long-term play and we expect it to yield exceptional returns once the transformation is complete.

Or, the market trades sideways, and the logarithmic graph also goes sideways. We could see on a linear scale something like a sigmoidsl s-shaped curve, where stocks mostly cap out at a certain amount and cease to be an asset class that really grows.

Or, it goes down after reaching a zenith. The log-scale declines linearly just as it rose linearly.

[Smart Mirror Product Action Shot](https://imgur.com/a/ZNJri3r)

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://imgur.com/a/ur3npx5)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

842,gzal2yn,2021-05-24 17:18:49,t1_gzal2yn,t1_gzaac56,StockMarket,"Lmao, I've been trading for years. THese terms are heard a lot because they're relevant right now. Treasuries are going negative, RevRepo rates are zero, yet we're seeing higher values than the bottom of the RonaCrash, and that points to a need for securities to generate more free-flowing capital, but I digress.  


Here is the longer, but easier-to-follow breakdown.  


>If SI is over 100% of the float and retail just keeps buying and holding, then it will inverse the market when there is a sell-off.

When you short, you borrow the share. you pay a fixed interest based on a floating share price. this is amortized daily, but the mechanics quickly become too wordy for a comment, so I'll keep it simple. This is also different than the official SI term. (Short interest is the overall term for outstanding shorts of a particular security.)  


You then sell the share, and you have capital.

Let's keep it simple. $10 share price, 10% annual interest.  


Since you'll be paying $1 annually, you want the capital you generated to make money so you are ideally net profitable without any movement in the share price. Usually, shorters play in the market, so the usual place is to pump it into the market.  


Still keeping it simple: Say you earn 20% interest in the market, because you invested in FRO last year.  


Summary so far:  
1. Borrow  
2. Interest agreed of 10%  
3. Sell to short (+$10)  
4. Buy $FRO with short capital (-$10)  
5. Earn Interest on $FRO of 20% (+$2)  
6. Pay short interest agreed in step 2 (-$1)  


The shorter's account currently sits at +$1, but also owns $FRO which is +$10 for a total of +$11. The owed short is sitting at -$10, so the shorter is in the green and is good.  


My first point of the selloff is if retail doesn't sell and the stock rises, the shorters are in the red, and some will be forced to close. If the stock doubles in price to $20, the shorter's 'account' is sitting at -$9, which is where margin comes into play. The shorter must keep their broker happy with enough cash/securities (based on the broker's terms). -$9 is under 50% margin utilization, which is usually okay. trouble starts if the stock increases by another 50%. At $30, the account is sitting at $-19, which is near to 100$ margin utilization. The shorter will receive a margin call which is: 'A.) Deposit cash, B.) Close your margin, or C.) We will close the margin for you and we don't give a fuck what we pay, because we hand you the bill.  


If you are closing a short portion for the short stock at $30, the money you put in the market will come out, PLUS more. this means $30 out of the market, which translates to a net decrease in the overall market (average stocks like FRO), \*BUT\* the shorted stock goes up because the shares are being purchased at market prices, therefore driving buying pressure, and driving it higher.

>  
When shorts finally close there positions, GME will fly even further, and money will be pulled out of the market to close the short positions.  


  
Margin calls have already likely happened/been happening because we're seeing massive selloffs. The S&P500 inflation-adjusted yield has fallen below zero, which happened in previous crashes ('08, .com, '87, etc.) It has set a 40-year low. the only issue? \*WHERE IS THE CRASH?\* My main belief is shorters on GME are selling to maintain margin requirements.  


If the shorted stock drops to $5, then the shorter makes more money. If the company gets delisted, the shorter pays no taxes, so \*effectively\* the shorter can make money two or three ways (depending on your view:)  
1. The initial sale of the security.  
2. The net interest gained  
3. The initial tax bill no longer needs to be paid. (Corpo tax rate of 2020 is 21%. which is a ton of extra cash.)  


NOW: There are rules in the United States:   
1. You \*must\* have a ""reasonable assumption of share locatability"" to be able to short a stock, aka 'I think I can find a share'. This rule is true for large players.   
2. Retail shorters must locate a stock before the short.  
3. Market makers are allowed to create synthetic shorts for liquidity reasons. (creating a synthetic allows the market to exist in a more steady fashion. THink like CSGO skins when someone buys a bunk on Buff.) When this operates properly, it is helpful. These shorts have a timeframe in which to be closed upon since they are only there to steady the market.   
4. Short interest can be an official \*MAXIMUM\* of 140%. This rule does not exist in the UK (Lehman took advantage of this in the years leading up to 2008 by transferring the assets to a UK-based subsidiary, and selling MBS over and over, which is called rehypothecation.)  


The issue with rule 4 is that SI numbers are self-reported and what happens when the large players bump over the number? Well, the average penalty for lying is a $1 fine per short lied about. It normally is a solid fine, as most companies being heavily shorted are in danger of being delisted. the $1 fine is proportional to the cost of the security.  


If there is more ownership than should be, then there are naked short positions. Retail ownership is holding steady based on On-Base Volume. OBV is a solid indicator of net ownership, and GME's OBV isn't reflecting the wild price swings. Regardless of the movement, it isn't dropping like it should, which is indicative of more short positions.   


Hopefully this is a bit more in-depth for you. I know what I'm talking about, no need to be condescending. If you want to chat about on a discord call, I frequent the WSBN discord under the name Thor\_Apparently. If I'm not on, ask the peeps in there and they'll reach out to me. I'm more than happy to chat.",,

I'm a swing trader and it sounds good to me, but it might be a dumb idea from an investing point of view.

\- I plan on buying $100 every Sunday (worst performing day for BTC).

\- I will only buy below the 50MA. If price on a given Sunday is above, then I will rollover those $100 to the next Sunday, or until price goes under the 50MA.

\- I'll buy $200 instead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 25%.

\- I'll buy $400 isntead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 50%. I've found that BTC's deepest dips are around that price level.

Let's take x as money value and y as product value.

The standard value is x = y, so a set amount of money can buy you a set amount of products. When inflation happens prices go up and value of currency goes down, these are not separated, they describe the same thing.

So e.g. 2x = y means you need twice the amount of money to buy the same product. The only way to portray that in real life is by increasing the price, which the 2x reflects. So saying prices doubled or saying the value of the currency halfed means exactly the same thing, though ultimately as a consumer the real point of contact you will have with that is the doubling in prices.

Technically speaking there are multiple reasons for inflation - and while it's definitely true that demand/supply play a major role (for goods), this only tells half a story. Inflation by overprinting is the core meaning of inflation, that is what you usually talk about when you talk about currency. If that happens your currency will give less currency from other countries, while also less goods. On the other side, demand & supply in your region will give you less goods, but still the same amount of foreign currency. So while saying demand & supply is inflation is also true, it's not really what most people consider because it's just one factor.",,

On the one hand it seems like inflation is already here, on the other hand the US Dollar is the reserve currency of the world. If we undergo hyperinflation, the rest of the world does as well. It's definitely possible, but the alternatives aren't super attractive either. Yuan? Euro? Bitcoin?

I will post the second list with the top 5 companies by insider selling activity later in a separate post, if you like this topic.

I entrust the analysis of the reasons for such peaks in insider activity to commentators - some are quite obvious, others are not.

The first definition under the Oxford dictionary is *a person opposed to new technology or ways of working*.

More and more people who have been anti crypto have done an about face and changed their position after doing more research. Ray Dalio just recently came around and says he now owns BTC. This list keeps growing.

You keep harping on this notion that cryptocurrency aids in criminal activity, but that's true for any new technology. Criminals will be criminals and use whatever means necessary. You could literally use this moronic argument for ANY NEW technology. When pagers became mainstream, it aided drug dealers. Internet allows pedos to easily link up and trade. Your narrow minded perspective is obviously shaped by the pearl clutching elites such as Janet Yellen who spread this nonsense to the naive public, and you morons eat it up ü§£",,

They also faired exceptionally well in the pandemic market and managed their situation about as good as you could ask for

Anything in commodities (STLD) is not surprising to me. Resource reserves are currently plummeting across the board

To grow you need funding and when funding is cheap you can do more. That is why fears of an increase in interest rates spooks early development growth stocks. If they can't get cheap funding, their growth will be slower and it may be harder for them to achieve their stated goals. This is why things like new EV / battery startups and ETFs like ARKK specifically got hit so hard when interest rates ticked up.",,

Streaming video was not possible during the days of AOL, and a single image took over a minute to load. Now we can watch TV on mobile devices that fit in our pockets.
