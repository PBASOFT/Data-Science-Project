45,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation?

48,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

50,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

62,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

65,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

76,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

86,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

**If your brain has folds in it:**

Essentially the code is using a monte carlo simulation to solve this optimization problem.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Interestingly, a company that came up with the  report called *Swan Street Research,* didn't have any work before issuing this report. The website was made on the day of this short report. Here is the link and you can see with your own eyes. 

[https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/](https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/)

The report is full of extremely biased and unfounded views, claiming that Yalla's numbers are ""Too good to be true"".

However, anyone with access to the internet can easily find out that Yalla's two major applications: Yalla and Yalla Ludo, consistently rank as top 5 and top 10 highest revenue grossing apps in 20 different countries. Here are some of the top charts attached below. You can also go to [Appannie.com](https://Appannie.com) to get the charts yourself.

You can see Yalla's revenue numbers are consistently higher than HUGE corporations like Tinder, Clash of Clans. In UAE, one of the richest and largest market in the middle east, Yalla has two apps in the top ten on AppStore and it is beating Youtube in terms of revenue. You gotta remember, Yalla is only valued at $2 Billion, a small fraction of the companies they are beating on the revenue chart. (Netflix has a market cap of $222B currently.

Yalla is currently trading at **16 times trailing P/E,** when YoY growth exceeds 221% in Q1. Again, shorts conveniently bypassed easily accessible AppStore revenue ranking and claiming that the numbers are ""Impossible"". In conclusion, if Yalla is valued at 60 times trailing P/E for its 221% growth rate, the company would be easily valued at at least $60 per share. 

These smaller shorts will be PUNISHED for messing with a growth beast like YALLA. Guys, you know what to do next!",nhg4u0,YALLA (NYSE: YALA) Number One Grossing App Across The Middle East Under Short Attack!

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

- Yalla claims to have 18 million active users but has 134 Twitter followers, 300 Instagram followers and 217 on YouTube. 

- I spent a couple hours in the rooms and people are literally talking fibbers. I understand a couple of the languages being spoken. They seem to be paid to be there and have zero energy in the conversation. Literally just saying what they are doing and repeating the same shit over and over. 

- I work in tech - this app has probably some of the worst UX (user experience ever)

- Middle Easterns don‚Äôt know about this ask. I asked a few of my friends in Bahrain, no one knows about this app. 

- this App has a small audience who is mostly Indian. They market them selves as middle eastern but India is not Middle East. When you check the Middle East rooms, they are dead empty. And the Indian ones are paid users talking random shit. 

- LinkedIn has 40 employees, 20 of which look fake

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

431,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

433,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

445,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

448,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

459,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

https://preview.redd.it/dibh93jl1a071.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c1871e08591796daa0a434274332cd9a4353258

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

483,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

I have a back ordered Model X and a pissed wife with a baby ape growing inside of her. She's do in July, car was supposed to deliver June, instead they are telling me Oct - now I am hearing Feb 2022. 

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will. TSLA is really effected by the chip shortage, orders from Dec. were promised Mar. & now they aren't expected till Oct and may be pushed back over all to 2022. Orders are being canceled, and you even have UFC fighters calling them out [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/) 

TBH I am just pissed Dariush gets a loaner and I don't, so I have decided to go about it my own way. I have puts and I am going to buy more puts tomorrow and hold it until it makes me enough money to buy my car cash. 

Support my vision fellow apes.

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Interestingly, a company that came up with the  report called *Swan Street Research,* didn't have any work before issuing this report. The website was made on the day of this short report. Here is the link and you can see with your own eyes. 

[https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/](https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/)

The report is full of extremely biased and unfounded views, claiming that Yalla's numbers are ""Too good to be true"".

However, anyone with access to the internet can easily find out that Yalla's two major applications: Yalla and Yalla Ludo, consistently rank as top 5 and top 10 highest revenue grossing apps in 20 different countries. Here are some of the top charts attached below. You can also go to [Appannie.com](https://Appannie.com) to get the charts yourself.

You can see Yalla's revenue numbers are consistently higher than HUGE corporations like Tinder, Clash of Clans. In UAE, one of the richest and largest market in the middle east, Yalla has two apps in the top ten on AppStore and it is beating Youtube in terms of revenue. You gotta remember, Yalla is only valued at $2 Billion, a small fraction of the companies they are beating on the revenue chart. (Netflix has a market cap of $222B currently.

Yalla is currently trading at **16 times trailing P/E,** when YoY growth exceeds 221% in Q1. Again, shorts conveniently bypassed easily accessible AppStore revenue ranking and claiming that the numbers are ""Impossible"". In conclusion, if Yalla is valued at 60 times trailing P/E for its 221% growth rate, the company would be easily valued at at least $60 per share. 

These smaller shorts will be PUNISHED for messing with a growth beast like YALLA. Guys, you know what to do next!",nhg4u0,YALLA (NYSE: YALA) Number One Grossing App Across The Middle East Under Short Attack!

If you are confident and good with your perception, its possible to make some decent consistent money, but you will ALWAYS win and lose some. If you go all in and reinvest your income, you might win big the first time, and win big for the next five times, but all it takes is one all in where you lose and say bye bye to 80 to 90% of your money.

707,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

709,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

721,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

724,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

735,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here.

How high could it go?

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I have a back ordered Model X and a pissed wife with a baby ape growing inside of her. She's do in July, car was supposed to deliver June, instead they are telling me Oct - now I am hearing Feb 2022. 

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will. TSLA is really effected by the chip shortage, orders from Dec. were promised Mar. & now they aren't expected till Oct and may be pushed back over all to 2022. Orders are being canceled, and you even have UFC fighters calling them out [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/) 

TBH I am just pissed Dariush gets a loaner and I don't, so I have decided to go about it my own way. I have puts and I am going to buy more puts tomorrow and hold it until it makes me enough money to buy my car cash.

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Interestingly, a company that came up with the  report called *Swan Street Research,* didn't have any work before issuing this report. The website was made on the day of this short report. Here is the link and you can see with your own eyes. 

[https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/](https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/)

The report is full of extremely biased and unfounded views, claiming that Yalla's numbers are ""Too good to be true"".

However, anyone with access to the internet can easily find out that Yalla's two major applications: Yalla and Yalla Ludo, consistently rank as top 5 and top 10 highest revenue grossing apps in 20 different countries. Here are some of the top charts attached below. You can also go to [Appannie.com](https://Appannie.com) to get the charts yourself.

You can see Yalla's revenue numbers are consistently higher than HUGE corporations like Tinder, Clash of Clans. In UAE, one of the richest and largest market in the middle east, Yalla has two apps in the top ten on AppStore and it is beating Youtube in terms of revenue. You gotta remember, Yalla is only valued at $2 Billion, a small fraction of the companies they are beating on the revenue chart. (Netflix has a market cap of $222B currently.

Yalla is currently trading at **16 times trailing P/E,** when YoY growth exceeds 221% in Q1. Again, shorts conveniently bypassed easily accessible AppStore revenue ranking and claiming that the numbers are ""Impossible"". In conclusion, if Yalla is valued at 60 times trailing P/E for its 221% growth rate, the company would be easily valued at at least $60 per share. 

These smaller shorts will be PUNISHED for messing with a growth beast like YALLA. Guys, you know what to do next!",nhg4u0,YALLA (NYSE: YALA) Number One Grossing App Across The Middle East Under Short Attack!

It made me think of the simple maths formula.

Suppose we have HFs A, B, C, D
1. Assume A borrows 1 million shares and immediately short them;
2. B buys the same shares and short them;
3. C buys same shares and short them;
4. D buys the same shares and short them

So, 1 million shares have created an additional 3 million shares out of THIN AIR.
Imagine how many times they have done it! There are more than 6,000 stocks traded each day on NYSE and NASDAQ alone.

Like the youtuber said, it is the first time HFs have been caught, GME being the early sign.

The whole market could be Trillions in HOLE!

1159,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

1171,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

1174,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

1184,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

1194,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

1208,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Interestingly, a company that came up with the  report called *Swan Street Research,* didn't have any work before issuing this report. The website was made on the day of this short report. Here is the link and you can see with your own eyes. 

[https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/](https://www.swanstreetresearch.com/)

The report is full of extremely biased and unfounded views, claiming that Yalla's numbers are ""Too good to be true"".

However, anyone with access to the internet can easily find out that Yalla's two major applications: Yalla and Yalla Ludo, consistently rank as top 5 and top 10 highest revenue grossing apps in 20 different countries. Here are some of the top charts attached below. You can also go to [Appannie.com](https://Appannie.com) to get the charts yourself.

You can see Yalla's revenue numbers are consistently higher than HUGE corporations like Tinder, Clash of Clans. In UAE, one of the richest and largest market in the middle east, Yalla has two apps in the top ten on AppStore and it is beating Youtube in terms of revenue. You gotta remember, Yalla is only valued at $2 Billion, a small fraction of the companies they are beating on the revenue chart. (Netflix has a market cap of $222B currently.

Yalla is currently trading at **16 times trailing P/E,** when YoY growth exceeds 221% in Q1. Again, shorts conveniently bypassed easily accessible AppStore revenue ranking and claiming that the numbers are ""Impossible"". In conclusion, if Yalla is valued at 60 times trailing P/E for its 221% growth rate, the company would be easily valued at at least $60 per share. 

These smaller shorts will be PUNISHED for messing with a growth beast like YALLA. Guys, you know what to do next!",nhg4u0,YALLA (NYSE: YALA) Number One Grossing App Across The Middle East Under Short Attack!

Thirdly, if retard one shorts a stock, it means retard broker loaned him a share to sell. He then has to buy it back and give it back to retard broker. If someone else buys it, and shorts it, you havnt created another share. Your just trading the same share. 

Retards like you don‚Äôt understand that for ever trade there is a counter party. When you sell your share, someone has to buy it. And visa versa. Shares aren‚Äôt created and destroyed just because people want to
Buy or sell them. That‚Äôs why volume is so important. Supply and demand. Shit you would‚Äôve learned in high school if you weren‚Äôt sniffing glue and eating crayons.",,

The year is 2001. You‚Äôre at a Chinese restaurant.Your uncle puts extra walnuts in your portion of shrimp. Sweet !

The year is 2008. You're a kid at a Chinese restaurant with your family. While waiting for the food to come, you entertain yourself by looking at fish and prawns and crabs in their tanks. Life's good.

The year is 2019. You‚Äôre walking at night down a chilly city street when you see the glow of the Chinese restaurant that you used to go to with your family. You don‚Äôt know what comes over you, but you decide to go in. The waitstaff are different but the flavors are the same. It reminds you of a simpler time. And for a moment, you‚Äôre not alone anymore.

The year is 2056. You sit back at a big round table at a new Chinese restaurant after dinner, slightly tipsy. Around the table are your family. Your children, all grown up now and sitting close to their partners. Your grandchildren are chattering away, playing with toys in their laps. You never thought that you would get to this point, but here you are. You lean back in your seat and relax. Your belly is full, as is your heart. Finally.

The year is 2057. The dementia progressed rapidly. Who are these people anyway? Food

The year is 2058. Shjslabdn Dim sum

The year is 2059. Your family gathers around your casket, celebrating your life, remembering the days you spent together. They commune at the chinese restaurant your family has been going to for nearly 80 years. A cure for Alzheimer's was found 2 weeks later.

This is my interpretation of todays 8k

-In todays 8k they announced plans to buyback shares via treasury stock method?

-after the merger, discovery will buy/own 70% of all its stock and existing discovery shareholders will own 30% via fully diluted basis

-the merger will be via reverse morris trust so HBO, CNN, and TBS etc will be spunoff and merged with discovery, thus creating a new company, as to avoid taxes?

Am I right or amirite?",,

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

2832,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

2835,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment.

2845,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There‚Äôs very little differentiation, he‚Äôll they‚Äôre in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

W-shape with today's price action.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

When the ruler of UAE realizes he‚Äôs backed a fraud they are going to revoke the business license of this company. The UAE is trying to transform their economy and they do not need this fraud preventing real investment.

Buy puts. This goes to zero, is paused from trading, or removed from the NYSE. It is the next luckin coffee. There are 100s of millions of dollars in reputable brokerage firms (Morgan Stanley who brokered this) right now scrambling to figure out if they have to dump this nonsense.",,

I'm holding because I believe, through hundreds of hours of reading and learning, that shorts never covered their original position and have instead dug a deeper hole. I believe it's to the point now where Citadel (a market maker), is forced to sell a share short for every share bought in the name of providing liquidity. I believe that retail owns HUNDREDS of % of the remaining float, and that a squeeze of epic proportions is coming, promoted by:

The DTCC, OCC, SEC, NSCC (all of which have created rules in the last 2 months which shelter themselves from a market fallout)
 
GME is conducting their annual shareholder vote in 3 weeks. When this happens, I believe they will tell their stakeholders that their voter turnout is indeed, hundreds of % of the outstanding shares. This will ultimately prove that shorts never covered.

I believe the Repo market is completely fucked, and banks are on the brink of yet another liquidity crisis which will happen before summer. This is partially due to the QE ending on Mar 31, as well as terrible money management by banks and hedge funds, who thought they could bankrupt certain companies that they thought wouldn't survive covid. Rehypothocated shares (shares borrowed, sold in the market which are then lent out and sold numerous times) have created a scenario where retail knows they hold the float and won't sell until they see share prices that look like phone numbers.",,

FYI I'm a high schooler so I don't really understand much, and I'm not very good with the technical terms. From the \~50% short ratio, I'm assuming \~50% of the shares are currently being shorted. Due to the relatively low amount of shares being traded, it would be hard to buy back all at once.

 Assuming the above is correct, my question would be if the short sellers wanted to buy back what they shorted, it would be very hard without pushing the price up a lot I believe. In my opinion, this could lead to a very dangerous bubble for this stock. Do you think this scenario is plausible?

A sexy butterfly lures them in with promises of alighting on their erect, sugar water covered üÖ±Ô∏èenis so they show up to the house naked and sugary.

When they get inside, Chris Hansen walks out dressed as a butterfly and asks them to ‚Äútake a seat‚Äù.

He asks what they‚Äôre doing there today and they‚Äôll stutter that they just came to talk to the young butterfly, so recently hatched from the nurturing chrysalis.

As they deny sexual intent, their words are interrupted by the soft sound of sugar water dripping from their dick and onto the kitchen tile...

This Lordstown Week idea shows supreme confidence in their own legitimacy and ought to erase many doubts stemming from the short report and SEC investigation. This inspired a ton of buying pressure and bull flag after bull flag. 

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

3235,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

3238,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

3248,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

3307,,2021-05-21 02:19:58,t3_nhhrmv,,wallstreetbets,"Since y'all seemed to enjoy my telecom company [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8ok60/fundamental_comps_analysis_for_vz_t_and_tmus_fair/), I thought I would share this one I put together for cruise ship companies. I had a suspicion that because this industry suffered so much during Covid there might be a value opportunity here, but based on my analysis the financials simply don't support that thesis.

With VZ, looking at the financials led me to further efforts: researching the nature of the telecommunications industry, the management team, wall street sentiment, and much more before I eventually purchased for myself (bought @ 55.87!). Here, I have not been nearly as thorough in investigating these intangibles because for me and my portfolio, the financials of these companies are a non-starter. If I had to pick a favourite it would be CCL (LIND for least favourite), but I do not own any of these companies and have no plans to purchase. If you have more info than me and think one or more of these companies are strong buys then tell me! I would love to have my mind changed and make some $$$.

**Model**:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOtF0m9AiS8OLVCeCfISRfiTwQGIGQ1cjWj3goP\_ro4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOtF0m9AiS8OLVCeCfISRfiTwQGIGQ1cjWj3goP_ro4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Carnival Corp., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., and Lindblad Expeditions Holdings Inc.
* Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 4)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply somewhat pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* The analyst consensus for revenue increases from 2021 -> 2022 are insanely high, but yes cruises are expected to rebound by that much
* The glaring issue with the comps analysis is that there simply aren't enough of them. I considered including Disney as a sort of look at what these cruise lines would all dream of being one day, but that was too much of a reach. If Disney Cruises released their financials separately that would be a different story, and beyond that I couldn't find any reasonable comps.
* Sadly, the best comparable missing, MSG cruises, is a private company :(
* Super low valuations for RCL and LIND are not mistakes...(unless they are), valuations so separated from fundamentals like this make me think something else is going on (industry consolidation? Upcoming M&A? Who knows)
* I try to be harsh on my fair value estimates to protect myself from making bad buys! Keep that in mind. I only want to put my capital where there is undeniably a value opportunity
* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

**None of this is financial advice. This is an exercise I did for my own use and thought this sub might find it entertaining.**  
**Do your own Due Diligence.**  
**I do not own any of these stocks.**

Fair Value Price Estimates:  
CCL 26.39  
NCLH 22.71  
RCL 39.31  
LIND 5.37

What I‚Äôm talking about has nothing to do with the market it has to do with life in general. If you have no fucking idea what you‚Äôre doing, and it involves enormous risk take the time needed to learn about the topic or find someone that‚Äôs willing to guide you in the right direction (those people that make up 5% of the people on Reddit) who are willing to help you learn and point you in the right direction via resources and *****basic***** common questions.

There‚Äôs some good people on here who will literally spend 10‚Äôs of hours of their precious time trying to help someone who knows absolutely nothing about this topic, and they‚Äôll provide them with resources and info to learn the knowledge needed to do this shit, and with no personal gain for themselves, and the person taking such advice can fact check it after the fact.

Other people are fucking sheep and they come on here not knowing *****anything***** about the market not knowing *****anything***** about day trading just following everyone else hell a lot of them can‚Äôt even distinguish something that‚Äôs complete and utter satire (which his comment clearly was) and to reply to such a comment saying 

‚Äúhow can I enable options and buy calls on everything ‚ÄúI just changed my settings now what‚Äù 

It‚Äôs astonishing. Firstly the dude wasn‚Äôt even talking to him he was having a conversation w someone else, and was making a joke, and some guy who creeps this sub literally responds thinking it‚Äôs real and follows everything he says without knowing anything about him or the topic, and not realizing it‚Äôs a joke.

Like do yourself a huge fucking favor if you know so little about a topic that you can‚Äôt distinguish a joke from real life then don‚Äôt creep on a sub you know nothing about and risk your money. If this was a health sub his joke would translate to stocks to health like him saying to smoke 5 packs of cigarettes a day to improve cardiovascular health, and the guy who has no idea on the topic responds being like okay I just bought a carton of cigarettes now how do I smoke them?

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

3731,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

3744,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

3751,,2021-05-20 15:20:43,t3_nh2zrs,,wallstreetbets,"So - this is another setup I've been watching closely for quite a long time. I've got two different charts I want to talk about today. For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

3768,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

[Outlook post from last night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngglg9/i_spy_519_recap_and_520_outlook/)

[outlook post from last night](https://preview.redd.it/3jqflwh9qc071.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36443442cb090f0598fe727d8911f80fc3be7d0)

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

1D RSI

* RSI at 53ish (>50 = bullish)

They choose LOTZ for 21 May 2021 BEFORE 9h30(New York time). We need to be united, it's us against the MM's and the fucking shorties.   
SHARE this :)  
We just need to put a market order few minutes before the bell. Just 1 share or more. No stop loss no target profit just 1 share or more. For me is going to be 1000 shares. Let‚Äôs go guys let‚Äôs do it and share this post.   
Analysts give a 22$ target and this is down because is so much manipulated. 1sharechallenge.com/events  
  
  
How to do this?   
1-Place a market order 5 min before the bell (9h30am New York time) 1 share or 10 or 100 or 1000 as much as you can  
2-becareful, do not allow pre-market fill, need to fill at the opening at market price, this going to create a synergy and burn all bears covering position.  
3-Don‚Äôt put stop loss or target price, just let it go!  
4-Enjoy the market maker and the shorties take a slap in the face!

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up.

RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

4785,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

4788,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

4798,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

4822,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Magnite will continue to be fintwit darling because there is a Wedbush analyst who had called it a TTD in the making, which I thought was horse sheet. Pubmatic's margins are great and the fact that they are profitable puts them in a niche category of IPOs right along with Good Rx, Zoom Info, Olo, etc. I am continuing to accumulate shares on weakness. I see them being a $10B company in the next 5-10 years. They hired away Spotify executive to take care of CTV business and then hired another lady from Disney Hulu.

5251,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

5254,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

5264,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk.

How high could it go?

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There‚Äôs very little differentiation, he‚Äôll they‚Äôre in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will.

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It‚Äôs nuts

From there it‚Äôll be up to the local politicians for action.",nhimlx,Does the government and fed allow/ encourage naked shorting.

Firstly o researched the average penis size worldwide which was reported to be 5.16 inches when erect. Based on this I found out what the average height was in the swampy country of Rwanda, the data shows the average hieght is 5ft 2 inches. With this data I calculated that the average penis is 12.0155% of the human body in Rwanda.  
  
Using this data I searched up what is shreks height, the most common answer was 8ft (96 inches) based on the findings of my previous data I calculated that shreks dick is 11.53 inches.  
  
This lead to me wondering what Fiona (shreks wife) height was as she must have been ruined pre ogre transformation, based on my research she was 5.10 meaning that pre shrek transformation she was taking ogre dick account for over 19% of her height!",,

Sell 10x covered call at 10$ strike for = $700 which is 82 shares (at current price). Which is 94 free shares, buy 6 more shares with deposit and then you have 1100 shares, 100 are almost free. Now you still have 100 shares of profit to the upside over $10 . Or the contracts expire worthless and you have 100 shares. The trick is to sell the premium on the runups and get the shares at a cheaper price so you can make 100 shares without deposit. Next time you will make $110 in divy + whatever you sell 11 contracts for. (If you keep the shares) If you get the same amount which was 11 x $70 = (770 +110 = 880) = or 100 shares at 8.80 each and total shares to 1200 (which make even more next time). In this way your investment will compound, or you sellem all at way more than you bought them.  Rinse and repeat. Then once a year Every year put some divy and premium back for your taxes.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

5928,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."
5929,,2021-05-19 20:21:49,t3_ngg05f,,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation? 

Same information, mixed understanding, and complete opposite decision on the market. So far, the sell side seems winning but the market seems to be really confused on where it should go.",ngg05f,Market is in a hella messy state and only certain thing is high volatility

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis.

You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5933,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

5945,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

5948,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

5958,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells.

More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

5982,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It‚Äôs nuts

Hi guys I‚Äôm new to reddit but I‚Äôve been following WSB from time. I need some help. Throughout 2020 I made some decent money buying monthly calls on tech stocks (turned $5000 to 25,000 USD). Unfortunately since the market of volatility of 2021 my portfolio is now under $1000 USD. If I ever make big money like that again I‚Äôm going to put a large portion into dividend stocks and/or real estate down payment.

The easiest one is the intrinsic value which for a put which equals the strike minus the price of the underlying (if it‚Äôs less than 0 the intrinsic value is 0) so in this case 210 - 170 = 40. And it represents 100 shares so 40*100= 4,000. It‚Äôs the value you make if you immediately exercised the option and then sold all the shares. 

The remaining factors that go into an option‚Äôs price are collectively called extrinsic value. The two main ones are time value and implied volatility. The more time till expiration an option has, the more time for the price of the underlying to move and the more time for the option to appreciate in value. So when you buy an option you pay the seller for all of the extrinsic value. As you get closer to expiration that extrinsic value will start to disappear and the time value of the option will slowly fall off. Look up more about theta if you want to learn about that. Options thats are out of the money time value decays faster, options in the money time value decays slower. 

The other big one is implied volatility which is a measure of how much the price of the underlying is expected to move. When he bought this, gamestop was moving like crazy, the implied volatility was through the roof. When he purchased that option, he had to pay the seller for that volatility. Well now the price bas calmed down so the volatility has disappeared and lots of time has passed so time value has devoured most of the value of this option. 

Like it says above he needs gamestop to be at $70.20 by expiration for this to break even. Or he needs this to absolutely tank in the coming months for some delta movement in his favor and for iv to pick back up.",,

Yeah, no shit, they're good with money. This is purely gambling. 

>apparently retail traders can‚Äôt make money trading options? 

retail traders can make money in the lottery (if they win the jackpot) or at a slot machine (if they win) or using options trades (if they win), but it's just luck, more often you lose money, so their advice is correct. 

If it was possible to learn how to trade options and then generate easy wealth for yourself, then everybody would simply do that and there would be no other careers etc.",,

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

6624,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."
6625,,2021-05-19 20:21:49,t3_ngg05f,,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

6627,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

6629,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

6641,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

6654,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

6661,,2021-05-20 15:20:43,t3_nh2zrs,,wallstreetbets,"So - this is another setup I've been watching closely for quite a long time. I've got two different charts I want to talk about today. For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have.

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# W-Shape Recovery?

[Outlook post from last night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngglg9/i_spy_519_recap_and_520_outlook/)

[outlook post from last night](https://preview.redd.it/3jqflwh9qc071.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36443442cb090f0598fe727d8911f80fc3be7d0)

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

* RSI at 53ish (>50 = bullish)

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It‚Äôs nuts

I always think of having to file taxes as my base example. I‚Äôve always used turbo tax and just never had problems. There definitely could be a better experience behind it all, but at this point it works, I know how to use it, and saving some potential money for a better experience here doesn‚Äôt make sense. I have a hard time believing any company doing tax filling better would have any chance of disrupting the market and capturing meaningful share. 

Mortgage lending? Yea that‚Äôs been around forever so that‚Äôs one of my main concerns, you are gonna get a lot of old fart players that will do dirty tricks to try to hold on.

First off 'customer first' is the standard big corps adhere to but there is customer first and EXCEPTIONAL customer first.

\-Ryan turned Chewy into multi billion dollar company that is better than even amazon when it comes to pet stuff.

\-IIRC someone quote Ryan as saying ""if you have a choice of making some extra money or delighting a customer always delight the customer""

\-Poster talked about how her dog died and chewy legit sent her flowers or some shit

\-Gamestop was having a ton of issues with customer service.  Ryan Cohen personally emailed a customer about some return policy that the customer was stuck in a months long cycle with 'old' GME with

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-cohen-insight-idUSKBN2BF1AS

\-Same day delivery-- they use doordash to deliver items to customers.  Sick.

""Cohen aims to turn GameStop into the ‚ÄúChewy of gaming‚Äù with lower prices, better selection and faster delivery times, said the sources, most of them speaking on condition of anonymity.""

It‚Äôs all done by computers dude.  You need a lawyer to dig through every trade for years to see where the synthetics came from ( they are 100% doing that on meme stocks because of the loss of income due to dillution) or have the company issue dividends.   The company pays the real shares the dividend, the synthetics get paid by the creators of the synthetic. You slowly drain them of their money.

I doubt Nintendo sells chairs, headsets, and gear. 

It won‚Äôt just be T-shirts, there‚Äôs a lot that belongs to being a hardcore gamer. 

People need to stop making GME dead, and acting like in the future gaming magically exists because you can download the game. 

It would cost Nintendo more to set up their own warehouses for distribution of their systems than just allowing another retailer to have them for sale, and let that cost burden be on them.

Beat your meat hard. Seriously. Tenderizing does wonders and it lowers stress.

Add salt and pepper, or your favorite steak spice or marinade. (Note, if marinating, let it sit in the marinade for at least least few hours, preferably overnight.... good quality steak needs nothing added)

Get the grill hot. Greater than 500F, but if your grill can push 6 or 700 go for it.

Sear it on each side, max 2.5 minutes depending on thickness. One flip only.

7399,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

7402,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

7404,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The stock is up 64% since the close on 5/13, through 5/19. Closing volume has ramped up steadily over the same period from 6.3m to 42.4m

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

It's still not too late to jump on the $RIDE train and ***squeeze*** the life out of the naysayers. All aboard!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

7416,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

7419,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

7429,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

7811,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

7814,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

7816,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

This Lordstown Week idea shows supreme confidence in their own legitimacy and ought to erase many doubts stemming from the short report and SEC investigation. This inspired a ton of buying pressure and bull flag after bull flag. 

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

I've been waiting for a red day since I heard the news after the pop, but idk if there will be one between now and Monday. And Monday could be an explosion or implosion.

7828,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

7831,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

7841,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will.

W-shape with today's price action.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It‚Äôs nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

The formula for compound interest is

P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where P is the initial principal balance (or in this case the current price) r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per time period and t is the number of time periods. 

So 2059 is 38 years from now
I will use the 100 day moving average, which is 394.46

So,

394 (1 + .1/1) ^ (1√ó38)


394 (1.1) ^ (38)

394 √ó 37.404343

Stop attacking an argument no one is making, it doesnt make your argument look better. Capitalism has strengths and I'm not saying it, or inequality, should go away. I'm saying when the difference between the 0th percentile and 99th percentile is roughly the same as 99th to 100th, maybe we need to think about some adjustments. Neither extreme allows for functioning liberal markets...

The economy IS zero sum almost by definition, and the sum is of the total output of the societies work. That's literally a fundamental underpinning of economics not to mention fairly basic if not necessarily obvious. The pie grows when the society either becomes more efficient (technological advances or increased specialization) or accesses new wealth (undiscovered resources or new demand for current resources).

I'm not arguing capitalism is bad, and capitalism requires inequality imho so I'm not saying that's innately bad either. With no value judgement i'm saying inequality, according to researchers, is among or possibly the highest it's ever been in human history. 

Separately, I'm starting that I believe the return on inequality is not infinite. Specifically, it would be more efficient if less of the wealth created by society was substantially removed from the economy and instead went to people who would spend it on goods and services allowing the economy to more effectively function. Not saying inequality should go away, saying there's no difference between no inequality and absolute inequality if you look at the bottom 99.9% and without inequality between where you are and where you could get capitalism fails.",,

Last time there was a bull run on the stock got to the same resistance (3/11-3/18) up 42.1% to $14.54 then on 3/19 slight drop of (0.5%) that was followed up by a (10.3%) drop on 3/22 and further drops of (14.7%) on 3/23 and (15.4%) on 3/24.  

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up.

RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers.

2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

8483,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

8486,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

8496,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

From the top: The date the call expires or can be exercised on.
The price ($300) the shares can be purchased for on that date.

The 9.25 is what there shares are worth right now per the calls value.

Position quantity of 33 is 33 calls worth 100 shares each. So 3,300 shares.

The cost is what they paid to buy these calls (someone else is putting their owned shares on the line at $300 on this date regardless of the current market value of the share). They paid $79,518.57.

The value of their calls have dropped in value by $48,993.57 and are now worth $30,525. (3,300 shares times $9.25 =)

If on july 16, the shares are worth $350 each, he exercises his calls and buys 3,300 shares for $30 each and then can immediately turn around and sell them for $350-$300= $50 *3,300 shares = $165,000 - initial cost ($79,518.57) = $85,481.43 profit.

But more than likely selling the calls themselves would be worth more money perhaps at a time before or after it's hits $300.",,

Life is funny like that you can easily become rich again, I will highly suggest against margin and risk liqudation in the future.

As a space *tourism* sector, I think VG has nailed it. I think it'll be huge. There's nothing the rich are looking to blow cash on more than a space exploration tour. With Branson's passion for space, catering to the rich, and (well) being rich I see huge upside potential on some LEAPs.

The beauty of SPCE is with VG being the parent company, they can pay expenses down to show better figures on 10Q until they're operational. There will be opinions for this as being good and bad, but it doesn't show as negative in the short term.

But when ever single automaker is pledging to go electric you don‚Äôt ha w to be a genius to figure out that they may do a better job the. Tesla 

Here‚Äôs the thing though and I‚Äôve done no research other tbe. Driving my wife‚Äôs Tesla .  I realized sometbing, that if I were to keep driving I would soon need to return home to charge or visit a (conveniently amd 10 years of building out ) Tesla super charger

Then I thought about it, I said I have a Porsche hybrid , if I needed to charge it and there was no gas available , what would I do, call an Uber or my wife .

delivered the power via truck


So while everyone sis out there making batteries And bullshit to compete with Tesla and Elon.  By the way he told nasa they were doing this shit all wrong and now they call him to go up there , also you‚Äôll find a Tesla floating up there because you‚Äôll find a super charger up there . 

This is 100 percent my opinion and my experience and I live in in the suburbs on NYC , we don‚Äôt ha w many super charges like in California, also my wife drives 29 miles round trip everyday cost us about a bucks a day .  But if she ever needed a charge , I would have no choice but to go get her .

It‚Äôs not a miney thjng it‚Äôs an infrastructure thing it‚Äôs your local and state and federal government, your power grid your local power company etc etc

So here‚Äôs the question,can anyone catch Elon.

Usually big start ups or big corps gets about 1.5-3 years before they get copied by the competitor .  There‚Äô are a few instances I. The recent past that have shown if any company gets further away then that time frame .  (Without Elon who builds reusable rockets electro. Cars chips for human brains , boring trucks to bore underground highways, and solar energy , but is 9 years late in the energy consumed and how its produces to mine it) 
You get the amazon effect

The ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a terrible idea. ThT will never work, what? free shipping , what ?electric cars, what ? Profits what? Margins what. ? ‚Äú

‚ÄúYeah okay the bug guys will eat you alive they‚Äôve been at this whole retail/ car thing forever ‚Äú


And then you wake up to 3 trillion dollar market cap between the 2 .
One sells less cars the. VW Produced since I started typing in a whole year
The other owns his customers and they pay him to own them ‚Äúprime‚Äù
So not only does Ford Chevy and VW have to produce a 4 door that doe the quarter I. 8.8 second seats 7 drives it‚Äôs self, I‚Äôve trades Tesla shares from the Tesla screen. Oh that‚Äôs just the sedan by the way.  
Or a semi truck that does 60 faster the. Whatever car you have in your drive way .  
Nor do they have to make rockets that land and that can be reused
They don‚Äôt have to bore holes and make underground d tunnels they don‚Äôt need to tweet like a drunk 16 year old and have SEC looking into it
 They need to buy Tesla or 
They have e to make up foe 10 years of infrastructure to support that. 

To bad every car company on earth combined couldn‚Äôt buy Tesla As crazy as that is , it‚Äôs 2021 .  That‚Äôs the world we live in , where valuations mean notbibf and someone who‚Äôs been rifbt once on the most famou short we‚Äôve lived to see says he‚Äôs short Tesla . I say I‚Äôve heard that for 7 years from 100 to 3000 a share and from 300 after split to 800 
I‚Äôve heard that about amazon.
But I also have experienced owning the car and working Witb amazon for almost 10 years
I know one thing
My wealth stems from amazon and Tesla was paid for by Tesla Gains.

And that‚Äôs when I bought the shares again. After the car . 
Or you can watch as that does f150 lightening( I ordered one this morning after seeing  Biden in it, also bought Ford shares 2 days ago and sold some inflated calls today.May be Ford can get to $3000 a shares and split 5 for 1

Oh wait this is 2021 Ford is profitable on every car, sell the shares dumb as company making money and shit 

Here‚Äôs the thing about today
Anything goes .  When nasa gives someone the green. Light , you can pretty much bet your life the way the astronauts do,  and maybe one day those shares can pass GME at the moon and you can see what Mars feels like.

Ford to $400 omg that was a typo Ford to $40 . WIt still a type for to 14 ?

9146,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

9149,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

9159,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

9169,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.

9221,,2021-05-21 03:56:29,t3_nhjghj,,wallstreetbets,"If you're still kicking yourself about not putting your entire 401k into Shopify and getting those sweet 40x gains, I think BIGC may be one of the next hot stocks.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Position: 2000 shares @ $55

Just one follow up if you don't mind, when you said 315 for him to break even, do you mean it would need to reach 315 for him to be able to sell the contract ITM and break even? Because these contacts would cost 9.9m to exercise at the strike correct? So he likely has no intention of exercising, but selling the contract ITM for profit? Which is another thing I don't get, why would someone buy an ITM call? Okay maybe I should go over to r/options like the other guy suggested haha.

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

9543,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

https://preview.redd.it/dibh93jl1a071.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c1871e08591796daa0a434274332cd9a4353258

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

9567,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# W-Shape Recovery?

[Outlook post from last night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngglg9/i_spy_519_recap_and_520_outlook/)

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It‚Äôs nuts

I really think this is huge for GOOG/GOOGL ad revenue. According to socialblade, there are 56 million channels under 1k subs(10-999) as of November 13 2020. Youtube previously demonetized smaller channels but I guess is going all in.

From Youtube: ""YouTube‚Äôs right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube¬†Partner¬†Program.""

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Position: 2000 shares @ $55

9708,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

If you move the decimal over 2 digits to the right of the share price, you will get what the purchase price of what 1 contract would equal to. . . 66.80 ---> 6680.00, or $6,680.00. 

His sole bet cost him $6,680.

OP is placing a bet, (he says at the time this was in December of 2020, that the stock, QS would reach $121.80 by expiration, which is tomorrow, 5/21/21. Since the stock did not do well,  currently @ $27.60. . . he did not fair well on this ""bet.""

Ivy league schools focus on that and their students are thuroughly vetted so you'd find a much higher concentration there.

Talking numbers and probabilities, if you threw 100 ivy league grads in one room, 100 state school grads in another, and randomly grabbed 3 from each room, out of the 3 'smartest' people you grabbed, you'd probably wind up having at least 2 of the smartest from the ivy league room.",,

9970,gywueld,2021-05-21 05:17:58,t1_gywueld,t1_gywsgt5,wallstreetbets,"The majority of American options are not actually exercised. I say American because in the Euro market it is different. I‚Äôm telling you this bc the gay nerds who studied this in school, their textbooks like to jerk off this point. So in Europe market you buy an option and you‚Äôre stuck with it until close. In America, land of freedom, you can do whatever the fuck you want, whenever the fuck you want. So if GME moons to 1mil tomorrow, he can take his profit and leave. 

But anyway to answer your point. An option has a writer (seller) and a buyer (this guy.) Anyone can be either. So when times up, the writer has to honor the value of the option, hence why it‚Äôs called an options CONTRACT. Technically the buyer could exercise and then sell in open market blah blah, to save time and a headache, usually if the seller is fucked they just pay the difference in cash. 

Let‚Äôs go a step further. To sell a contract, the normal person should be hedged with shares. I would need 100 shares to sell a contract so that if GME moons then I can keep my premium and the price of my contract is covered by me having the shares to give the other guy. (Covered call.) Hence why this sub exists. Because with options, (although extremely dangerous) you can ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù a shit ton of shares, make a shit ton of money, without having to have started off with a lot (leverage). The autistic thing is that most people end up losing (loss porn.) 

Now for the magic. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a big Wall Street asshole. I can make a deal with the broker to sell calls naked (without having the underlying shares) and the broker will front the collateral under a margin loan. Now let‚Äôs say GME moons, Wall Street asshole gets fucked. Bigly. Margin call. Account blown. The GME bull thesis is mostly about shorts covering, not call sellers getting fucked but that‚Äôs good to know too. It‚Äôs called a gamma squeeze. Basically in the event I see my naked calls fucking me in the ass, in order to hedge the position and not blow my account, I would have to buy the shares to hedge myself. So then the stock will squeeze. There are many squeeze possibilities. MOASS (mother of all short squeezes) is still on the table. 

You must learn young retard. Don‚Äôt worry, I was once even more retarded than you. This is enough for today. Your homework is to find out what ‚Äúoptions Greeks‚Äù are. Now eat your crayons and go to bed.",,

AMC won't go much higher and the selling of stock will probably net more than selling their option to close so it makes sense to call it in now given current stock prices.",,
