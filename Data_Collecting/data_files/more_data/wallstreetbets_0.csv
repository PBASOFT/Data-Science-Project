 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

36,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,
41,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,nei5qk,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term. 

I am an ape as like you , This is not financial advise just my personal targets .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
95,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

446,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,ndsgrw,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

473,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,
478,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,nei5qk,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term. 

I am an ape as like you , This is not financial advise just my personal targets .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
532,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

The latest gold bug wet dream is the Fed taking gold to $50k is some perverted version of the trillion dollar platinum coin (as if a single trillion dollar injection would be enough).

I really dislike everything about Schiff(ty), but there is a nexus of destruction that I believe people are neglecting.  Right now, the world has moved from buying US bonds to investing in US debt and equity markets.  When those markets begin failing, people will move out of them much quicker than they would the US bond market (and their next move won't be to put their preserved capital into bonds).

That's where the real danger is.

The harsh reality is that there are debt and equity markets all around the entire world. There are mirror companies for pretty much every US economic undertaking.  Some of these markets and companies are severely beaten down, representing huge value that exists outside of the US markets.",,gyi1ybh,t1_gyi0lcr

My guess, is they are actually doing Due Diligence of their own and have realized we've been bandying around the IBKR numbers, so their trying to mask their movement a little. With that said, at the end of the day only 45-50k has been been returned to IBKR leaving a very significant amount left over. They haven't really begun to cover.

Finally, if you're going to sell your shares, and are cognizant of the gamma squeeze for the love of god sell deep ITM covered calls instead.

1456,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,ndpiru,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

1459,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,ndsgrw,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks. 

The market rewards those who risk more!............but only when you are correct in your prediction.

Is it just because of TSLA cult?

Burry was right and went hard on the y2k .com bubble.

Burry was right in 2008 and went hard, super yolo.

Burry is a legitimate Autist (though, Musk is too LUL)

Burry was the original GME Long...the dude exited before others because he had to take profit for his fund.  With the large amount of money he had invested, he knew a downturn could be swift and he could have a hard time exiting.  Investing your own money is different than investing other people's money....he still made a 5X play.

Burry is a genius and a truth-speaker.  

Between the two, I would never bet against Burry.  Unlike the other ""doom sayers"" the guy is right when he points something out, and he isn't just a doom and gloomer..he goes long in good companies.",,gyi393b,t3_nenzge

AMC sells at what, hundreds PE or they lose money. MRVI has revenue growth of 191% PLUS actual earnings of $1.12 per share projected for this year. That one is a very close comp.  


AMC has HUGE short interest because lots of people know, um, I mean think it's shit and they are getting CRUSHED for it. Run AMC. run.  But with MRVI, nobody would dare short that thing for reasons stated.

1802,2021-05-17 22:49:27,t1_gyi3v7l,,wallstreetbets,"I never said I believed any of this crap works, but your tax dollars still pay for some research into it. They're predominantly trying to quantify inuition. There's a pretty famous case of a sergeant in Iraq evacuating a crowded cafe because he got a weird vibe from one of the dudes in there. They found IEDs the guy had planted. The sergeant couldn't point to any single thing about the guy or any action he had taken that tipped him off. He just felt like something bad was about to happen. Stories of squad leaders that seemed to have a sixth sense of ambushes or traps have been around in the military since forever but in the US especially from Vietnam. The military wants to know if there's real scientific legitimacy to the claims.

The rational argument for stories like that is that the person subconsciously noticed minute clues in behavior, body language, or changes in the environment that tipped off the conscious brain to potential danger. The slightly less rational explanation is that the humans, or at least some of them, have an as yet unquantified sixth sense. Call it ""spidey sense"", intuition, or pre-cognition. The military is going to spend your tax dollars finding out, and if it's the second one they'll spend more trying to figure out if it's something they can train into their soldiers.

I personally lean more towards the skeptical side on this stuff, but it was fun reading classified reports of the more out there shit the military funds.",,gyi3v7l,t1_gyhak7a

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

1966,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,
1971,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,nei5qk,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
2024,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

&#x200B;

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

&#x200B;

**Netflix has a history conducting hit jobs on struggling companies and stepping into their shoes.**

The Motive is there so who owns institutional shares in Netflix? Well for starts.. **Citadel owns $4.7B**

Follow the monies....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I welcome to your thoughts

Edit: If successfully completed Netflix would set itself apart from the competing streaming services and would start to step into Amazon's financial realm.",Think about why GME & AMC are shorted simultaneously.. Suppose Netflix had the chance to take over Videogames and In-person movies revenue... Lucrative,,

I literally just got off an online gambling website, playing live roulette.

And although he had to act professional, that crazy fuck kept chanting to the moon, with hundreds of players on the table. 

We ended up talking about how we're going to buy lambos and land on the moon by just being patient. DEALER APE, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, IT WAS AN HONOR PLAYING WITH YOU! And next time, ""lambo"" better have an s at the end. 1 is never enough.

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

(the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

2284,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,
2289,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,nei5qk,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.

""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
2341,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

&#x200B;

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

&#x200B;

**Netflix has a history conducting hit jobs on struggling companies and stepping into their shoes.**

The Motive is there so who owns institutional shares in Netflix? Well for starts.. **Citadel owns $4.7B**

Follow the monies....

I welcome to your thoughts

Edit: If successfully completed Netflix would set itself apart from the competing streaming services and would start to step into Amazon's financial realm.",Think about why GME & AMC are shorted simultaneously.. Suppose Netflix had the chance to take over Videogames and In-person movies revenue... Lucrative,,

I literally just got off an online gambling website, playing live roulette. The dealer, one handsome sunovabitch from Latvia was having a conversation with one of the players and i heard him say ""to the moon"". So, like the retarded ape i am, i head to the chat and asked him if he's one of us. That motherfucker says he is and hes been holding since jan. And although he had to act professional, that crazy fuck kept chanting to the moon, with hundreds of players on the table. 

We ended up talking about how we're going to buy lambos and land on the moon by just being patient. DEALER APE, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, IT WAS AN HONOR PLAYING WITH YOU! And next time, ""lambo"" better have an s at the end. 1 is never enough.

Think of all the people not paying their mortgage that can‚Äôt get foreclosed on because the government won‚Äôt let it happen. Why is it so hard to buy a house right now? Because no one is selling! People can‚Äôt even think about selling their houses because they‚Äôre worried about having one to begin with. Banks are absolutely fucked and already strapped for liquidity hence the insane overnight repo loans we‚Äôve been seeing. When millions of homeowners default on their mortgages all at once and these mortgages turn from accounts receivables to losses the banks are going under 2008 style and their rehypothecated MBS will be worthless.

2623,2021-05-17 23:04:25,t1_gyi5pda,,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not pushing anything. I haven‚Äôt made any posts promoting the stock. I established a position in it before the increase in attention from WSB. I already rode the GME train, I did fine. My GME position was established last year and closed earlier this year. As entertaining as it is seeing hordes of gamblers constantly feed their addiction and provide each other with confirmation bias, I hit my profit target and exited. 

I entered a position with UWMC because of technicals combined with the extremely high short interest. Just because you haven‚Äôt heard of a stock doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt have potential or interest from other people. The universe is larger than two stocks. If you dedicate your trading existence to simply following what gambling addict claim to be doing on Reddit, you deserve the result. 

While true short squeezes are rare, there can be substantial upward pressure from very high short interest. It can provide opportunity if the entry point is low enough and the short interest is high enough. In the past 5 days, UWMC has gained over 20%, for example. And that‚Äôs without really much covering by the shorts. Why? Look at their ER and the analysis with it. Not OP‚Äôs post here, but legitimate analysis. Plus, it pays a dividend very soon. 

TLDR; the company is in the process of buying back substantial shares of stock, the ER was very good, short sellers have likely oversold their positions, the cost to borrow shares (if you can find them) is astronomical, and I like money. I use that money to make more money by finding opportunities. If you keep expecting the same play on the same stock to just keep repeating itself (and aren‚Äôt actually operating off a legitimate technical basis or algorithm-driven trading), then hard lessons will be learned. There is a substantial difference between a trader and a gambler constantly yoloing or someone who has whatever pittance they call a yolo tied up on a meme stock for months on end instead of actually making that money do work for you.",,gyi5pda,t1_gyi306b

Everyone here is fawning over the prospects for GME and AMC, when the real play is AMD because 1) It is legitimately backed by hundreds of reputable funds.  2) It is a sound business that is growing like crazy.

You have already been given the proof when Robinhood halted buying on AMD.  Why did they do this?  AMD was not even on the radar like GME when they did it.  They do not want you buying AMD.

tesla =  comedian nerd,

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl,

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

2721,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,ndpiru,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

2724,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,ndsgrw,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

2751,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,
2756,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,nei5qk,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term. 

I am an ape as like you , This is not financial advise just my personal targets .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
2808,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

I was very familiar with his anti-tesla rhetoric. In the beginning, I thought he was trying to burn the entire company down in reality, he was just playing around the sentiment surrounding the stock. He doesn't have any particular agenda other than playing who ever he can. With the GME trade he played the hedge funds and with tesla shorts he played retailers. 

TSLA rocketed like nothing else. But that would mean a ""big short""-esque short position would bu(r)ry him financially. So, this could be alleged his positions are shorter than what people assume. I bet he already exited a major portion of the position and trying to see how the market would react to this planned news story.

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this.

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

3214,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

‚ñ™ The economic re-opening driving omni-channel growth in digital ad spend  (see [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-spending-jumps-as-companies-ride-economic-rebound-11619784459) and [this](https://digiday.com/marketing/how-the-worlds-biggest-advertisers-are-spending-or-not-as-industries-adapt-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2/))

‚ñ™ Continued growth and evolution of the connected TV and over-the-top streaming ad markets . US CTV ad spending has a total of $8.11 billion and expected to increase to $11.36 billion in 2021 (up\~40%) and continue to grow (see [this](https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-connected-tv-advertising-2020) and [this](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1048897/connected-tv-ad-spend-usa/))

‚ñ™ Continued ad spend consolidation by agencies and advertisers.

The company provided guidance that ""We expect to deliver outsized revenue growth in 2021 as well ... due to convergence of three key trends. ""\[paraphrased\]

There are more exciting details in their SEC fillings if you want more data.

&#x200B;

The company stock is currently heavily shorted and stock price has been on a landslide lately. I believe the risk-reward ratio here deserves a mention and it's time to build a position and reap the reward later. Of course I might miss some details and would appreciate a callout if you see it.

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
3271,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

&#x200B;

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

&#x200B;

**Netflix has a history conducting hit jobs on struggling companies and stepping into their shoes.**

The Motive is there so who owns institutional shares in Netflix? Well for starts.. **Citadel owns $4.7B**

3443,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,ndpiru,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked.

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

3446,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,ndsgrw,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

3473,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

Their software monitors user activity to automate repetitive front and back office tasks, including those performed using other business software such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software.

In April 2020, UiPath was named the top tech company and #2 overall in the Financial Times FT1000 ranking of Americas' fastest growing companies 2020[https://www.ft.com/americas-fastest-growing-companies-2020]. In June, UiPath was named to the CNBC 2020 Disruptor 50 ranking [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/uipath-disruptor-50.html]. In September, UiPath was ranked #3 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list for the second consecutive year[https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#37c358225f94]



Last month $path went public with only 23million shares as IPO. In addition, UiPath has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3,583,616. All together that's less than 25 million shares. 


ARK already snapped 6.4 million shares of path. Minus the ARK's shares, there are less than 19 million shares available. Any bulk call buying can trigger a huge run on shares as just 190k call contracts would require option sellers to buy every single available share from the market (incase they didn't cover their calls yet) .

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

This is Patrick Karim master road map for [\#silver](https://twitter.com/hashtag/silver?src=hashtag_click).  Silver will enjoy capital flows from disillusioned [\#FAANG](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FAANG?src=hashtag_click)  stock holders... who will now seek the silver whale!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term. 

I am an ape as like you , This is not financial advise just my personal targets .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
3530,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I worked 7 years in Audi in Germany in the development department until 2013. I had many meetings with the board members. They were not interested in EV because ""there is not the market yet"". 
Audi experts laugh at the engineering and quality of the Teslas, of all, only recognize the good software. Audi can develop 10 times more Teslas than Tesla if he wanted it, but still the EV market is niche market and its business plan is not based on the political Loby to achieve pollution credits in the USA, it is about producing real cars for real use.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this.

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

4246,2021-05-17 23:34:43,t1_gyi9c7y,,wallstreetbets,"I mean it makes sense that the same Curved Brain Hedgies that Shorted GME shorted AMC and UWMC. Or at least that there is a ton of spillover/exposure between the three. So with all three pushing in the right direction... Should we not be seeing a collapse of all three? One would think that once the covering begins on AMC- The covering at GME and UWMC isn't far behind. (Or Vice Versa). A domino effect in full. Certainly can't be smooth sailings over in Short Town. $UWMC Value guys like me are full Ape with you these days.  
  
Including my earlier post on UWMC- For some reason WSB seems to be taking it down? Unsure what Guideline I'm violating but perhaps it sticks better here.  
  
Full Disclosure- I own a Mortgage Brokerage. My Office is all long UWMC.  
  
I am the opposite of most of you Apes. I am a Value Investor. Yes- They still make me. A damn dinosaur lurking amongst you apes. I have never been a big proponent of these ""Squeeze"" plays. Gamestop and AMC and RKT felt a bit like musical chairs. If the Music Stops I have Zero Interest in a $150 Gamestop Share. Or a $40 RKT. I can't imagine many rational investors thinking OH BOY! I'll just Hodl this to the Grave with GME. That seems full Autist. Its a squeeze play through and through.  
  
On the other hand I buy $UWMC because I know it as the market leader in my industry. Criminally undervalued at the moment. The CEO is a mad man. Wakes up at an ungodly hour and works well into the Evening. I know because the bastard has called me at 5PM Pacific after emailing me at 3AM Pacific the night before. (And I'm not a huge account). Mat Outworks everyone. Always has. Why?  
Mat has a Big Ass chip on his shoulder. Not wired like me. I'm a happy go lucky dude. Not ultra competitive. Google Image Mat Ishbia and then figure out how he Walked onto Michigan State to play for Championship caliber Tom Izzo. Ass Kiss and Hustle. Pure Salesman through and through. From relatively humble beginnings Ishbia now has Billions. In Detroit. Guy could choose to never work another day in his life and still live out all of your fantasies each and every day. Full on Rat Race with the Stripper and the Hot Tub. But he doesn't. He keeps Grinding. He keeps going. Why? Because he wants to be #1 in the mortgage space. That's his goal. Always has been. I'm wagering (With near all of my families worth) that he gets there.  
  
I liked $UWMC at $13. I liked it more at $9. I went ""All in"" when it fell into the 7's. Other Coworkers (Lucky Apes) went all in mid 6's. Based on where they stand right now (#2 Mortgage company in the world making cash hand over fist) it pencils out. If you are betting they are #1 within 4 years (Which I AM) it Certainly pencils out. So that is to say that today at $8.25 its still very much a bargain and a long term hold in my book. Its not Ultra Sexy. Its just a Cash Cow. I could sell this to Aunt Dorothy in her Retirement Account with the utmost of ease of Mind. Dorothy- Relax and catch a Dividend. This Stock Fucks.  
  
Which brings me the the whole Squeeze thing. I've read a few of the DD's on this and from what I can see- You apes might be right. There are only so many Shares outstanding and apparently the Hedgies decided to fuck with $UWMC because it was a SPAC. (Yes as a value guy I hate most Spacs). But they fucked up on this one. Only reason they went SPAC was liquidity issues during Covid. Ishbia was sick and tired of not having the Funds to fight Rocket. Spac was the fastest avenue to get the Cash.  
  
So here we are. We have a value play that attracts Value guys like me. But it also pops up as a possible Squeeze play. In my book I see this as the clear best Squeeze to someone jumping in now because there is no musical Chair game. You get $UWMC at $9? $10? $12? $15? $20? Great. Enjoy it. The company pencils out to earn enough cash to substantiate those valuations. $UWMC is the play that is in my opinion extremely safe yet also has the potential to really pay off for your Wife's Cabana boy.  
  
Oh- And all you $RKT guys out there. I'm sorry to burst the bubble there. Stop. Listen to the $RKT earnings call. Listen to $UWMC. then come back to talk. Not only did $RKT miss on Q1 but they forecasted a worse Q2 and then doubled down by adding- Hey- From here on out we are going to compare future quarters to 2019. 2020 is an unfair comparison/benchmark because it was a ""Outlier"" in the industry. $UWMC took the opposite approach. Ishbia said Q2 would surpass Q1 2021. Ishbia then went on to say he expected 2021 to EXCEED 2020. I mean cmon. $RKT says we aren't even going to compare with our last year of Corporate earnings. $UWMC said we are going to beat last year. Rocket was cute as a Squeeze (I mean its a damn RKT) but don't try to sell me $RKT as a smart long term hold.  
  
I suppose there is a reason all of you Apes write this is not Financial Advice so here I am- This is not Financial Advice. I have no Financial chops. Just a smooth brained Mortgage Broker betting on the winner in his Industry. Its UWM. By alot.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

I have a feeling we break that $7.14 range highlighted on the 30minute as our next resistance then it's on to $8 $9 and $10!",Monday Morning Analysis on $WELL $WLYYF,,

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

4358,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,
4363,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,nei5qk,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We‚Äôll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

Recently been looking at stock named $ANAT. American National Insurance. They took a large hit at the beginning of covid for obvious reasons... they have a diverse portfolio of insurance policies which is counter to what other insurance companies are going for. Down below I will link some information about this company. I like doing a form of DD that lets people make their own conclusions. Fuck confirmation bias.

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
4415,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

Coronavirus knocked AMC Entertainment (AMC) to the mat -- but it's not out of the fight yet.

Saved by the fortuitous arrival of a ""Twitter mob"" of Reddit-informed, Robinhood-powered daytraders who kept its stock alive when value investors had given it up for dead back in January, AMC kept its head above water long enough to cash in this week.

As the company announced last Thursday, it has successfully completed the sale of 43 million shares, sold ""at-the-market"" price. AMC has raised $428 million to bolster the balance sheet. And luckily for AMC -- and thanks to all those daytrading momentum investors -- the market price for AMC stock is now nearly $14 a share, or about seven times the mere $2.01 a share it was fetching at the start of 2021.

And one analyst believes AMC could even be worth more than $14.

B. Riley analyst¬†Eric Wold¬†reiterated a Buy rating on AMC shares along with a $16 price target. This figure implies ~15% upside for the year ahead. (To view Wold's track record,¬†click here)

Wold believes that AMC probably has enough cash that it won't need to raise any more ""before industry trends recover in 2022/2023"" -- although it still has the option ""to take strategic actions to improve the balance sheet further.""

Indeed, the analyst says AMC now has ""at least a one-year cash runway"" at current levels of movie attendance (and probably longer than that, given that attendance is improving).

Wold describes AMC's decision to raise cash this month as ""opportunistic"" rather than ""necessary,"" and notes that the company has taken other steps to bolster its balance sheet, including renegotiating its property lease terms to take into account diminished attendance at its theaters during the pandemic. At the same time, the analyst believes AMC has an ""improved cash flow outlook"" this year, predicting a ""box office recovery into year-end,"" which will yield more revenues to cover the company's expenses.

Already, says Wold, both New York and California, two of the biggest markets for movie-watching, have more or less eliminated capacity restrictions on theater attendance. And this lifting of restrictions coincides with the arrival of ""pent-up demand for moviegoing"" among viewers who've been essentially locked out of theaters for the past year. Wold describes the slate of blockbuster movies coming out this summer as ""impressive,"" and says the release dates for these films have ""begun to stabilize in recent weeks,"" which should make it easier to predict the box office hauls that AMC might anticipate as the year progresses.

Running the numbers, Wold estimates that U.S. box office numbers will be down 70% in Q2 2021 (relative to 2019 levels), but down only 35% in Q3 (the summer quarter), and down only 20% in Q4 (the winter quarter). In dollars and cents, the analyst says this should translate to nearly $2.5 billion in revenues this year, nearly doubling to $4.7 billion in 2022, and then growing about 15% to $5.4 billion in 2023. By that point, AMC should be almost back in the black, losing only $0.35 per share in fiscal 2023.

Ôøº","Is AMC the next GME? Will it do a squeeze to $300? Flush with cash, AMC is still a ""buy"" says analysts!",,

and now the oil is flowing all over the place like a freekin can of whip cream just exploded cuz you left it in your car in the heat tooo long

but wait now the king of the playground is pissed hes not getting his fair market share. and the price of crude shits the bed and now driller have no money to drill holes. this leads to some serious blue balls creating a shortage of sweet musky petrol.

the price of crude begins to rise until the driller is now flush with cash again and the cycle repeats.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

5770,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,ndsgrw,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

5797,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/1712043/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)


Investors in¬†GameStop Corp.¬†GME¬†need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What Is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What Do The Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",Implied Volatility Surging For GameStop (GME) Stock Options,,

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
5847,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

**Netflix has a history conducting hit jobs on struggling companies and stepping into their shoes.**

The Motive is there so who owns institutional shares in Netflix? Well for starts.. **Citadel owns $4.7B**

I welcome to your thoughts

Edit: If successfully completed Netflix would set itself apart from the competing streaming services and would start to step into Amazon's financial realm.",Think about why GME & AMC are shorted simultaneously.. Suppose Netflix had the chance to take over Videogames and In-person movies revenue... Lucrative,,

Coronavirus knocked AMC Entertainment (AMC) to the mat -- but it's not out of the fight yet.

Saved by the fortuitous arrival of a ""Twitter mob"" of Reddit-informed, Robinhood-powered daytraders who kept its stock alive when value investors had given it up for dead back in January, AMC kept its head above water long enough to cash in this week.

As the company announced last Thursday, it has successfully completed the sale of 43 million shares, sold ""at-the-market"" price. AMC has raised $428 million to bolster the balance sheet. And luckily for AMC -- and thanks to all those daytrading momentum investors -- the market price for AMC stock is now nearly $14 a share, or about seven times the mere $2.01 a share it was fetching at the start of 2021.

And one analyst believes AMC could even be worth more than $14.

B. Riley analyst¬†Eric Wold¬†reiterated a Buy rating on AMC shares along with a $16 price target. This figure implies ~15% upside for the year ahead. (To view Wold's track record,¬†click here)

Wold believes that AMC probably has enough cash that it won't need to raise any more ""before industry trends recover in 2022/2023"" -- although it still has the option ""to take strategic actions to improve the balance sheet further.""

Indeed, the analyst says AMC now has ""at least a one-year cash runway"" at current levels of movie attendance (and probably longer than that, given that attendance is improving).

Wold describes AMC's decision to raise cash this month as ""opportunistic"" rather than ""necessary,"" and notes that the company has taken other steps to bolster its balance sheet, including renegotiating its property lease terms to take into account diminished attendance at its theaters during the pandemic. At the same time, the analyst believes AMC has an ""improved cash flow outlook"" this year, predicting a ""box office recovery into year-end,"" which will yield more revenues to cover the company's expenses.

Already, says Wold, both New York and California, two of the biggest markets for movie-watching, have more or less eliminated capacity restrictions on theater attendance. And this lifting of restrictions coincides with the arrival of ""pent-up demand for moviegoing"" among viewers who've been essentially locked out of theaters for the past year. Wold describes the slate of blockbuster movies coming out this summer as ""impressive,"" and says the release dates for these films have ""begun to stabilize in recent weeks,"" which should make it easier to predict the box office hauls that AMC might anticipate as the year progresses.

Running the numbers, Wold estimates that U.S. box office numbers will be down 70% in Q2 2021 (relative to 2019 levels), but down only 35% in Q3 (the summer quarter), and down only 20% in Q4 (the winter quarter). In dollars and cents, the analyst says this should translate to nearly $2.5 billion in revenues this year, nearly doubling to $4.7 billion in 2022, and then growing about 15% to $5.4 billion in 2023. By that point, AMC should be almost back in the black, losing only $0.35 per share in fiscal 2023.

Ôøº","Is AMC the next GME? Will it do a squeeze to $300? Flush with cash, AMC is still a ""buy"" says analysts!",,

They have the world's largest library of on-the road driving computer vision data, and that's stuff has trained their AI models. They are years ahead of the curve. No one else comes close. Should they license it to a traditional car manufacturer, that'll change the car manufacturing game forever. 

And then they have the largest charging station network. Again, no else comes close. They could license that, as well.

If you look at Tesla as a car company, yeah, it's massively overpriced. 

But if you look at Tesla like an Uber..then it's a whole other ballgame. Like Uber, there are lots of new players competing ride-sharing/food delivery services, but Uber has so much leverage as the incumbent, first mover at scale, that's it's unreal and essentially they have distribution monopoly, or very close. 

Tesla is similarly sitting on assets that could do the same play on software and it's amazing to me he hasn't sold out to anyone yet. 

Basically Tesla has so many exist strategies if traditional car manufacturers take aim at their market share, that it makes Tesla a very slippery, very competitive, software company like no other.

Having said that, I don't like to talk about stocks that are green. I want red. I get excited by panic. I thrive on market fear. I will talk about a stock, when nobody want to talk about it.

Today's topic is Clover Health - CLOV. They reported a decent earnings report this morning and the stock plummeted after. You now have to explain to your girlfriend why you won't be able to take her out for a nice dinner. Well, I'm here to tell both you and your girlfriend that market is playing games with you. The same way it played on UWMC few days ago. Let's take this slowly.

# Who put money into Clover?

Despite what Hindenburg is paid to write, we gotta make one thing clear. Clover is not a scam company. There are no SEC investigations. Nobody is stealing anyone's money. Take a deep breath. Although the first name that comes to mind when you hear word ""clover"" is Chamath, we gotta make another thing clear. Chamath is not the only one who dumped his money into CLOV. There are many other big boys, his friends, from the Silicon Valley whom he took to watch free Warriors NBA games. Two names stand out the most. First is Alphabet (yes, Google) and the second is Sequoia. If you don't know who Sequoia is, [please look at their investment portfolio](https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/).

The point is, Silicon Valley's money is in this ""scam insurance"" company. And let me tell you something, those guys do not like to lose their money. Trust me, you don't get to fly private jets, own NBA teams and hangout with top models if you lose money on your investments.

# GME Grudge

If you remember, Chamath used to be a frequent guest on CNBC. However after this interview, he was **never invited since**.

https://preview.redd.it/lb6qc1xmqrz61.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b15a31b1aec84448305897ac083f45a0ae0a06

After that, the media which promoted Chamath as the SPAC King took a sudden turn, where Bloomberg every few weeks posts something bad about him.

At the same time, CLOV among other Chamath's stocks have been sliding down and down and down and down...

FYI, Class B shares are not trade-able and can't be sold until CLOV hits $30 and stay there for at least 90 days. Also, Chelsea Clinton is Clinton's daughter. Yes, those Clintons.

That's right 46% jump. So the bottom line is that when a stock is beaten down to this level, there is a big mathematical pressure that even a small $ recovery will result in large % gains.

# Growth

Clover is growing. Their revenue is growing. They are having more contracts than before. They are expending to more states than before and [they are hiring massively](https://twitter.com/SilbergleitJr/status/1375534983851470850?s=20).

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?","Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top.",,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

6378,2021-05-15 22:34:58,t3_nda9rc,nda9rc,wallstreetbets,"The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.",$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3X,,

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors.",Comprehensive Guide to EV companies,,

Simply viewing **$TSLA**'s P/E ratio (**581.29** as of 5/17/21) it's very apparent that this stock is immensely inflated. The average automotive price to earnings ratio is sub 20, Tesla is **29X** that amount! Smart billionaires such as Michael Burry are already acting on this opportunity of a lifetime. People who buy **$TSLA** aren't investing in the company, they are investing in the brand of ""Elon Musk"" whose Wikipedia page is currently being rewritten to pretend he didn't come from immense wealth. After looking at the numbers I find myself wondering how a company that only started making a profit THIS YEAR can pay billions of dollars in loans to China by 2023? 

I will personally be buying as many **puts** as I can comfortably afford to so I can enjoy a comfortably rich lifestyle when this is all over.

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors.",Comprehensive Guide to EV companies,,

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

I was going to leave it in my saving account for emergencies when I noticed my interest rate was a whopping 0.5%! So I created a Robinhood account. I put $90 into AMC on Friday, and $20 into Tesla, apple, & amazon. I've made $16 bucks off the AMC and penny's on the rest. But with the excitement of over a 10% return over 1 weekend just killed the idea of keeping a savings account. I know I am new and that's not normal, but I'm having fun...

I know I'm not gonna get rich, especially only being able to add a few bucks a month to my robinhood account, but I want to keep enjoying myself and maximize my pitiful gains....

So, short term, should I dump everything I have just into AMC? Diversify into GME? Or play the long game with TSLA?

Zero debt, and have tons of flexibility in the market. If there's a fed legalization, they can scoop up growers, manufacturing, and logistics companies. Likely they're still shit, but they're debt-free, 1B cash and profitable shit. AMC could have at least raised cash, and they chose not to.

It would be quite foreseeable that Netflix would want to expand their exclusive movie operations and is looking to take over the majority ownership in AMC through equity shares in order to do so. But... instead of purchasing those shares (like Porche did to Volkswagen back in 08') they shorted the company almost into liquidation so they could get it on the cheap. Only problem is they didn't see this squeeze coming.

I gave some thought to the GME play as well. It would also be quite foreseeable that Netflix saw the value in Gamestop's customer base as they could take over the chain with the same play stated above, and rent video games to Gamestop's customer base.

Better yet: ""'hardcore' idol culture is pretty uniquely asian"" (which, already... at best ""EAST Asian""...) - I'm sure that's the problem. Not that, you know... they're speaking almost exclusively Japanese.

And about that last paragraph... what manner of dipshit are you? ""obsessive white-knight types""? Literally explain how I'm supposedly ""white-knighting"", fucktard. You obviously know fuck-all about what goes on in any typical Hololive stream if you think it's generally about idol culture. It's got nothing to do with ""gatekeeping"".

Balances game and chat a bit more but I'm still looking for more improvements. Especially with footstep increase/comm decrease. I find just decreasing the volume of your voicechat in game is a good temp fix. Also valorant footsteps are low/lowmid bass frequency heavy so upping your low frequencies a tad may help with footsteps.

Make your own judgement here, but consider...

1) Burry has to file this. He wasn‚Äôt promoting it. 
2) This is for positions held through 3/31/2021. That was 45 days ago. 
3)TSLA closed at roughly $670 on 3/31. It‚Äôs currently at $570 and Lo of $559. 
4) it‚Äôs entirely possible he could have closed his position and made a lot of money. He also could still have it. 
5) he has very consistently expressed his feelings about TSLA since last year. This isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúnew‚Äù or ‚Äúnews.‚Äù
6) before he deleted his Twitter a few months ago, he was REALLY comin in hot with the hyperinflation narrative and comparing it to Weimar, Germany. Could he be right, yes, could be. Is he probably going insane because no one expected the FED‚Äôs intervention efforts to play out like this? Possible.

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

7810,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day.¬†

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered.¬†

Playing to win¬†

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting.¬†

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs.¬†

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year.¬†

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement.¬†

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,
7856,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,nesw0u,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

If it's in the same tax year, you just do the wash sale math, and if you closed it out then you get whatever it is.

Say you buy at 10, sell at 8, and buy back at 6 within 30 days.

Instead of having a loss of 2, and a cost basis of 6, you instead have a loss of 0 and a cost basis of 8. 

If you then sold at 7 you have a loss of 1, instead of the loss of 2 and gain of 1 you were expecting. If you sold at 9 you'd have a gain of 1 instead of a loss of 2 and a gain of 3. 

If you didn't close out, then you don't get to claim that loss and that sucks if you were counting on it, but the difference carried forward in the cost basis adjustment so you'll get it later.

And if you sold in December and bought in January it's worse, but I can't remember why. I think it's basically the same as the didn't sell case. You lose the loss but get it in the adjusted cost basis going forward.",,gyij9lx,t1_gyif5sa

While working on the South Park Investment Theory I've decided to make a post a bit more tailored to investors that focus on the Fundamentals.

George Soros just increased his holding in DR Horton making it his second largest holding after Amazon. But a less well known homebuilder may be a stronger play for the Retail Investor.

**$HOV** is probably the best way to capitalize on the residential real estate boom. They are a historically strong homebuilder with Lot's & Contracts in the hottest U.S markets (NC, FL, AZ). The catch is their debt load is HIGH... for now...

[$HOV Debt Load](https://preview.redd.it/sl50rhjvoiz61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=e049ab303551dc4320b2e922e93f915b0b16125a)

$HOV has one of the smallest Market Caps & lowest Price/Sales ratios in the homebuilding industry.  $HOV is at least a $2B company hidden in a $700M body, however with the low volume and current debt load until there is proof (AKA Earnings) that the debt load is being paid off the stock will hold under $1B.

**Pros:**

\-Increase Lot & Home prices

\-# of Sales

\-Pay off debt load. $HOV has made this a PRIORITY

\-Renewed Investor interest (Multiple Expansion)

\-Deferred tax asset of $572M will shield $1.8B of future pretax earnings 

\-Refinance 2026 debt load at a lower rate.

**Cons:**

\-Commodity price increase (e.g. Lumber, Copper)

\-Higher Mortgage rates

\-Ultra Rapid Urbanization

\-Senior's create housing supply when they pass away, move in with kids, or assisted living.

&#x200B;

**Key Metrics ($HOV vs. Rest of Homebuilding Sector):**

\-Gross Margin: 20.7% (+3.4% YoY) vs. 21.17% (1.98% YoY): In line with the homebuilding industry.

\-P/E Ratio: 10.59x vs. 11.48x: Earnings has weighed this down due to High Interest Payments on debt.

\-Forward P/E: 4x (Based on $HOV Guidance)

\-Price/Sales Ratio: .32x vs. 1.06x: One of the lowest ratios in the homebuilding industry

&#x200B;

**Market Statistics:**

The housing market may seem a bit overheated, but with extreme undersupply even weak demand can't kill the homebuilders. Rates are at record lows in comparison to the 13%-18% in the 80's and 7%-10% in the 90's. A potential slowdown in demand doesn't seem to be an issue with more people looking for SFR's as a potential income stream and the rise of the millennial homeowner. Demand still hasn't topped out when looking at previous market cycles.

[# of Sales](https://preview.redd.it/q3y7fv3zziz61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=c683719b33d1e8e02b910f10c0f166191ca617b9)

An efficient housing market will usually have \~6 months of housing supply. As of March 2021, Existing Single family inventory is sitting just under 1M which is only 2 months of housing supply. New inventory is currently at 3.6 months. This is another indicator that we are in the buyers market and there aren't too many signs that we'll be reaching 6 months any time soon without a major increase in supply. Supply is still at historic lows:

[Housing Supply](https://preview.redd.it/2t2nf59d5rz61.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=f272878c623aaeeb21ff476ebabdef67d30d91e2)

**Key Date's (Earnings & Other Data):**

May 18th: Residential Construction data

May 21st: Existing Home Sales data

May 25th: New Home Sales data

May 25th: Toll Brother Earnings

June 3rd: $HOV Earnings

At the end of the day it comes down to if Management will be able to cover it's debt load. If so, $HOV deserves to be priced in-line with it's industry peers.

And to add a little more spice, once this passes $1B Mkt Cap it'll attract more attention from hedge funds/institutions. Once the stock reaches a certain price management may decide to stock split to increase liquidity which should attract more retail investors. Stay strong during this market wide Algo correction and wait for Homebuilder Data to be released the next 2 weeks.

8066,2021-05-15 21:56:15,t3_nd9hyr,nd9hyr,wallstreetbets,"UWM‚Äôs new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the ‚Äútotal yield‚Äù as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts‚Äô estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.","UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPS",,
8067,2021-05-15 22:34:58,t3_nda9rc,nda9rc,wallstreetbets,"The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.",$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3X,,

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

BUY ONE SHARE at current price 5/18/2021 and hold that bitch for 10 years+ - **THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE**, If I am wrong CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT MY ASS AND REPORT ME TO THE SEC, IDGAF!

Not a whole lot of people will claim this so boldly, am I DFV? Fuck no! That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about? Most likely not, does anyone really know? Make fun of my retarded ass IDGAF!

Its one of the most American Companies around, even more American than Mcdonalds and Coca Cola **combined**. In my opinion THE BEST industrial Giant!!!!!!

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?","Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top.",,

> Tesla historically racked up around $1.6 billion in regulatory energy credits, primarily zero emission vehicle credits, which helped Tesla report more than four consecutive quarters of profitability, qualifying Elon Musk&#039;s automaker for addition to the S&P 500 index.

> Tesla is currently delayed in producing and delivering its updated versions of its high-end sedan and SUV, the Model S and X. And it is delayed in commercial production of its custom-designed &quot;4680&quot; battery cells for use in forthcoming vehicles, including the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi.

> Correction: Michael Burry is long puts against 800,100 shares of Tesla, according to a filing with the SEC. An earlier version misstated the number of put contracts Burry purchased.

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors.",Comprehensive Guide to EV companies,,

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

8660,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,ndsgrw,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

I have heard traders say that they got their position by just talking their way in after just skirting their way through college. Many don't do truly in depth further research. If a company says that it is making billions, find out where and why that is. If they claim they will double their profit, find out how and why. Half of what he had done to make so many great trades are the things that people skip over. It is even in the movie The Big Short, but most just see it as a throw away line. They discuss how he knew the market was going to fail and one of the characters says he actually read the documents followed by ""who actually reads those?"". 

He probably researches 100s of companies and that is the reason he makes so few trades. If you go for the ones where the BS is going to surface soon, you can ""YOLO"" it all on 2 or 3 trades a year and end up with massive gains. If anything, he is probably way more risk adverse than people think.",,gyilmff,t1_gyh5ied

My local restaurants can't find people to serve me my favorite hamburger and Chipotle now wants to charge me more to make me a burrito.

I used to save all my paycheck that I used to spend going to the bar and picking up 8's that turned into 5's in the morning. I also saved the money I would spend going out to breakfast with said 5 in the AM drinking enough alcohol to turn them back into a 6.5 before we said our goodbyes.

Sometimes I would go to the mall and buy an Orange Julius or a Hot Dog On a Stick. Sometimes I would go see a movie or play paintball with some randoms just to pass the time. And other times I would just go to the local track and play the horses.

But during the pandemic all of that spending turned into gambling on stonks. Waking up early in the morning to read the message boards to see the next hot stonk. Buying calls on BJs and NIOs. Riding OSTK and GME to the moon. And spending hours on end reading Reddit posts.

But now that the economy is reopening I want to do all of that stuff again. Hopefully that 5 is still a 5 and not 300 lbs from binge eating while watching Netflix and Marvel movies on Disney +. Maybe I'll be able to find a mall that has most of its stores in operation and a movie theater with actual real good movies to watch. I want to go to the beach and get a tan. $#@& do I need one living in a cave during this last year.

This means I'll have less time and money to yolo on stonks. And since Biden and others want to stop the stimmy by the end of the summer. I imagine others will have to get a job too. Which means they won't have as much time to yolo as well.

What do you think will happen? What do you plan on doing? Why does everyone think this could all continue if the world is getting back to normal? And given your perspective, what are you doing over the next 3-6 months to take advantage?

TLdR 

Economy closed. Everyone yolo-ed their money on stonks. Now that the economy is reopening people want to do $#@& again. Are you going to sell some of your stonks and gamble less on them because you want to do $#@& again? If so, how much and when?",What's your strategy?,,
8964,2021-05-15 21:56:15,t3_nd9hyr,nd9hyr,wallstreetbets,"UWM‚Äôs new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the ‚Äútotal yield‚Äù as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts‚Äô estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.","UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPS",,
8965,2021-05-15 22:34:58,t3_nda9rc,nda9rc,wallstreetbets,"The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.",$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3X,,

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about?

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?","Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top.",,

TSLA broke key 200 day moving average support levels today with it dipping below $565. Burry's filing shows a massive short position out for TSLA, bad press with NFT's. Lots of catalysts.

However, if we look out in options futures, still seeing huge liquidity of open long positions with calls out until September. Specifically massive uptick in the $600 calls for 7/16 in just the past week.

Really feels like we are at a pivot moment where TSLA will sink or swim. I have short positions $565p 5/21, long $600c 7/16. Plan is to scalp price actions to reduce cost basis for my poorly timed purchase of the 600c (down 19%). Plan to jump ship if we hit below $550 and short short short.

Question is, is anyone else still going long for TSLA?

Of course, with any new administration comes a new stock set to explode and others set to fall. The financial advisors whom I have spoken with have advised me to stay away from oil and coal and to start putting more and more money into renewable energy ETFs and companies. The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals. 

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it. 

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

At least according to this sub, squeezes can last hours, days, or weeks - I suspect as GME or AMC build past where they are now, FOMO will kick in again. Once a significant dip from the top happens (like 10%-15% or more) then fear will set in, and the price will settle back to valuation and/or however much the bagholders are hoping to sell at to get out of their dead position.

AMC and GME could go on forever at an inflated price, but more often then not they will leverage their high valuation for acquisitions and dilutions to fund expansion efforts until their true value equalizes. Or, the apes here will be satisfied and sell until the only people left are individuals, ETFs, and institutions wanting a piece of a unique business (brick-and-mortar/online gaming-focused store.)",,gyinxfm,t1_gyimc5p

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More",,

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors.",Comprehensive Guide to EV companies,,

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.,,

I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin,,

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

&#x200B;

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

9654,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,neg3ey,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?,,

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.","Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate",,

I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

While working on the South Park Investment Theory I've decided to make a post a bit more tailored to investors that focus on the Fundamentals.

George Soros just increased his holding in DR Horton making it his second largest holding after Amazon. But a less well known homebuilder may be a stronger play for the Retail Investor.

**$HOV** is probably the best way to capitalize on the residential real estate boom. They are a historically strong homebuilder with Lot's & Contracts in the hottest U.S markets (NC, FL, AZ). The catch is their debt load is HIGH... for now...

[$HOV Debt Load](https://preview.redd.it/sl50rhjvoiz61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=e049ab303551dc4320b2e922e93f915b0b16125a)

$HOV has one of the smallest Market Caps & lowest Price/Sales ratios in the homebuilding industry.  $HOV is at least a $2B company hidden in a $700M body, however with the low volume and current debt load until there is proof (AKA Earnings) that the debt load is being paid off the stock will hold under $1B.

**Pros:**

\-Increase Lot & Home prices

\-# of Sales

\-Pay off debt load. $HOV has made this a PRIORITY

\-Renewed Investor interest (Multiple Expansion)

\-Deferred tax asset of $572M will shield $1.8B of future pretax earnings 

\-Refinance 2026 debt load at a lower rate.

**Cons:**

\-Commodity price increase (e.g. Lumber, Copper)

\-Higher Mortgage rates

\-Ultra Rapid Urbanization

\-Senior's create housing supply when they pass away, move in with kids, or assisted living.

&#x200B;

**Key Metrics ($HOV vs. Rest of Homebuilding Sector):**

\-Gross Margin: 20.7% (+3.4% YoY) vs. 21.17% (1.98% YoY): In line with the homebuilding industry.

\-P/E Ratio: 10.59x vs. 11.48x: Earnings has weighed this down due to High Interest Payments on debt.

\-Forward P/E: 4x (Based on $HOV Guidance)

\-Price/Sales Ratio: .32x vs. 1.06x: One of the lowest ratios in the homebuilding industry

&#x200B;

**Market Statistics:**

The housing market may seem a bit overheated, but with extreme undersupply even weak demand can't kill the homebuilders. Rates are at record lows in comparison to the 13%-18% in the 80's and 7%-10% in the 90's. A potential slowdown in demand doesn't seem to be an issue with more people looking for SFR's as a potential income stream and the rise of the millennial homeowner. Demand still hasn't topped out when looking at previous market cycles.

[# of Sales](https://preview.redd.it/q3y7fv3zziz61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=c683719b33d1e8e02b910f10c0f166191ca617b9)

An efficient housing market will usually have \~6 months of housing supply. As of March 2021, Existing Single family inventory is sitting just under 1M which is only 2 months of housing supply. New inventory is currently at 3.6 months. This is another indicator that we are in the buyers market and there aren't too many signs that we'll be reaching 6 months any time soon without a major increase in supply. Supply is still at historic lows:

[Housing Supply](https://preview.redd.it/2t2nf59d5rz61.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=f272878c623aaeeb21ff476ebabdef67d30d91e2)

**Key Date's (Earnings & Other Data):**

May 18th: Residential Construction data

May 21st: Existing Home Sales data

May 25th: New Home Sales data

May 25th: Toll Brother Earnings

June 3rd: $HOV Earnings

At the end of the day it comes down to if Management will be able to cover it's debt load. If so, $HOV deserves to be priced in-line with it's industry peers.

And to add a little more spice, once this passes $1B Mkt Cap it'll attract more attention from hedge funds/institutions. Once the stock reaches a certain price management may decide to stock split to increase liquidity which should attract more retail investors. Stay strong during this market wide Algo correction and wait for Homebuilder Data to be released the next 2 weeks.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals. 

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

While I really like the technology it hasn't really gained traction. No hydrogen infrastructure ( I would rather make hydrogen for gas turbine technology as it makes better use of it and has a further reach), it's still expensive, and is relatively unknown. I like the technology a lot, but it's still so far out there before it's really viable and green new deal will have little impact on it. Maybe I'm wrong but I've been waiting 20 years for it to do something.

Now, if you find anyone focused on hydrogen production, that Is something to look into.

Battery storage, hydrogen, wind are all going to do well. While I would like to see fuel cell technology grow, just not seeing it for quite some time.",,gyiorkm,t3_nexk1o
