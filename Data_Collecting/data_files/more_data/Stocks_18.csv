&#x200B;

the issue is gene therapy is coming, and while EXEL checks all the boxes, the fear is its time of super growth is done and they need to pivot to expand their line.  This includes buying other companies, management also sells a lot of shares.

  
Now could it be a buyout?  sure the company buying won't lose money on them...but is it worth it to tie up that cash to produce cash flows?  probably not. Management would have sold.

&#x200B;

I don't believe management is aggressive enough to turn the ship into a gene therapy POWERHOUSE.

&#x200B;

Everyone bashes GILD saying cures are bad..NO cures a VERY good for business, if GILD could cure every disease they would why?  because that GOBBS of cash as everyone rushes for the cure would be insane.  Then they can use that cash to target the next/next/next.  the issue is no one has a platform to cure every disease.

&#x200B;

its possibly CRiSPR or whatever tool is being developed.  They don't have profits now, but if this platform pans out I suspect we see a big bio FIRE a MASSIVE buyout MAYBE 5-10X the price as that platform cure every disease would be the holy grail to unlock the economy.

&#x200B;

Now that person with STDS is cured and go out and date (SPEND MONEY), the blind person can see and travel. (SPEND MONEY....everyone with a disease has a bucket list and you can GUARANTEE THEY WILL SPEND LIKE DRUNKEN SAILORS to enjoy life.  Look at covid, everyone just wanted to get out and SPEND again.  Now imagine all those hiding with diseases who are just waiting to be cured.  The market is immense.  Hence why so much money is being poured into this sector.

Chuck Hull, 3D System’s former president, and CTO invented stereolithography and received a patent for it in 1986.

Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminded plaintiffs on May 17, 2021, that the closing date to file a lead plaintiff petition in the class action brought on behalf of investors who bought or otherwise acquired 3D Systems Corporation shares between May 6, 2020, and March 1, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”) was approaching on June 8, 2021

Defendants made knowingly inaccurate and/or misleading claims during the Class Period, according to the lawsuit, and refused to reveal significant adverse information regarding 3D Systems’ industry, activities, and prospects. Defendants specifically refused to inform investors that:

3D Systems violated adequate internal controls on financial reporting.
As a result, Defendants’ claims about 3D Systems, activities, and prospects were materially inaccurate and deceptive and/or lacked a fair basis at all applicable times.

195,,2021-05-20 15:19:12,t3_nh2yi0,,stocks,"I have been out of lithium miners since the beginning of this year after I exited my Livent position at what I thought was a peak at ~$20 per share. As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking.",nh2yi0,SQM and lithium demand

You can think that CRISPR is gonna cure all ailments and diseases in 15 years (which is an ambitious claim - if something sounds like science fiction the reality is often much much more nuanced and has a long way to go), but even if that was true, that doesn’t mean the small companies looking into it now will be around forever. Biotech companies are notoriously difficult to start, don’t return profits for a long time, and are dependent on the FDA, and I’m sure the owners are just hoping to sell to Merck, Pfiszer, etc. once the time is right. Trying to commercialize something that is intrinsically out of your control and left to nature (scientific results) is extremely stressful cause you can do everything completely right for 2 decades and wind up with absolutely nothing. If I started a company like that and it wound up becoming profitable, I wouldn’t start calling myself the new Bill Gates and stick with it. I’d sell to the highest bidder ASAP.

Also love what you said about TMO. If there is one constant in my life as a graduate researcher, it is absolutely Thermo Fisher. If there is an option to buy something with Thermo, I will, even if it’s 50% more expensive. Their partnerships with research institutions like mine just make it easier to order from them than from competitors. Don’t even need to use a purchasing card - it’s all in the system. And they sell almost everything. They’re not going anywhere and if biotech grows, a small biotech company might not, but Thermo sure will. Cause almost every single item that went into conducting every experiment was probably purchased through Thermo or Sigma. And they are the masters of upchargjng for items, but have a customer base that cares less about being upcharged because “that’s just how it is in science.”",,

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN) 

Trend-wise: BABA is on downtrend, AMZN is a resistance level (which one is more likely to break-out?)

Multiples-wise: BABA appears a bit cheaper than AMZN on the value side, on growth ratios like Price Per Sales, or EPS Growth, AMZN is much better.

So I wouldn't touch BABA when AMZN is right there.

It's a company that uses satellites to allow a 5G signal to your phone from anywhere on the planet (similar to Starlink but for phones). 


The killer features are that you don't need to buy ANY additional hardware like you would for Starlink, it works with any phone in existence right now.

AND they partner with existing carriers, so you don't need to switch carriers or anything to get 5G everywhere. You just pay an extra dollar a month on top of your normal bill. 


The reason why it's down is that it was recently brought public by SPAC, and the institutional investors dropped their stock as soon as it went public. Secondly, while they have launched test satellites, the full satellite fleet has not been launched (will be by the end of 2022).

- Cathie started the space fund, signifying to retail investors that space might really be the next frontier . She also bought a ton more shares. 

- Then the whole short squeeze started happening, and any stocks that hedge funds had so much as a single bad thought about rocketed. Not to mention, the whole short squeeze brought in a ton of new ""dumb money"". 

- Then, test flights were rescheduled. 

- All while nasdaq was going absolutely nuts to start the year.

- and SPAC euphoria (and by extension anything having to do with SPACs) were on an absolute tear.

- and growth stocks as a whole were the place to be.

Now, growth stocks are dead. Cathie has sold off all her holdings of SPCE. Nasdaq is treading water and barely up on the year, while having a terrible run the last few weeks. Inflation fears have killed growth stocks with no/bad balance sheets, and SPACs, once the darling of the retail investment community, are dead. 

By comparison, in january,  you wouldn't find a single SPAC trading under NAV. Regardless of what SPAC you were, an LOI whisper sent it up at least 10%. Now, without a DA in place, very few SPACs trade above NAV. heck some are even still at NAV with an LOI.",,

I'm on the fence about it, think it's got some issues with scalability and it's crazy volatile but I like the decentralization and I also know people who have made money off it so for me the jury is still out on it. 

What I'm wondering is that once the US government gets involved how is the worth going to be any different than fiat which is just as worthless when you analyze it? 🤷

At Fidelity Brokerage Services, it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment-for-order-flow on the option orders, according to its 606 report.

According to these 606 reports, Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities. Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E-Trade while ranking lower for stock trades. At First Trade and TradeStation, Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks (trades with no stated price limit) and number one for options.

Since they only follow the tracks it's an easier problem to solve computationally. 

Eventually, the competitors will be able to map out everything, but there's a finite limit to how quickly they can do so, and there are a lot more roads that can be mapped out. The competitors will do well as long as the driver's stay within the park, but it'll be quite dangerous to go outside of it.

Tesla seeks to be able to drive pretty much anywhere. This is a much harder problem computationally and will take longer to solve. So it certainly does come down to which solves which first.

I live in a fairly rural area, I would be very surprised if any Tesla competitor becomes located in my area within the decade, as they will be focusing on cities, so they will likely become available in every city, then start mapping smaller and smaller towns before they have full coverage. Perhaps they can do something like Tesla and put mapping systems into the cars that are already driving and thus speed up the process. But in the end, the scaling problem isn't something that can be quickly resolved, though the issues on Tesla's side are certainly not trivial either, though they don't have any scaling issue. They are already operating at scale, they just need to get the software (and perhaps hardware) working as well as they would like. That is just a matter of continuous improvement.

Overall, I believe I'll see a Tesla robotaxi in use in my area before I see a non-Tesla robotaxi, though I'm certainly hard pressed to say whether it'll be a few months from now or a few years from now, though I think it is likely to be 2-5 years, mostly for regulatory reasons. Even when it is considered truly FSD, it will require probably at least a few months of data to act as evidence that it truly is better than a human before it get's regulatory approval.

SPXU (3X short S&P), SDS (2X short S&P) or SH (1X short S&P). The 1X is the better bet if you are going to hold it, but the 3X is probably best if it's looking like it's about to tank (or already is) and you want to capitalize on it.

I believe these have less risk than actually shorting (as long as you are careful about which you use and how long you hold it for).

Generally you don't want to hold those for long, so unless you think the S&P is going to tank within a few days.

Of course, holding this will offset some gains, so more useful if you can buy just before hand or you are 100% sure it's going to tank and you are just waiting for it to so (in which case, the 1X or 2X wouldn't be bad, as loing as you don't go too heavy into it and sell near-ish to the bottom)",,

The amount of money you make if the spy corrects to say $200 (seems extremely unlikely) would depend on the premium you pay. If you buy a 3/22 405p right now the premium is $25 so if you hit 200 that premium now becomes 405 - 200 = 205. So you have almost 10x a return there.

The various disadvantages of LIDAR  are not a problem in a calibration run:

- **High LIDAR unit cost:** not a problem, because there are only a few calibration units.
- **Poor LIDAR performance in rain & snow:** not a problem, as the calibration runs are done in good weather.
- **Interference of many LIDAR units:** since they'll never scale this up, there's no interference in practice.
- **Health risks of LIDAR:** they don't need high power LIDAR, nor are there multiple vehicles for the LIDAR laser beams to add up.
- 
- **High mapping & map maintenance costs of 3D HD LIDAR maps**: not a problem, because Tesla is not using HD 3D maps at all - they compare LIDAR return to the neural network stack distance estimates to calibrate.
- **Poor ability of LIDAR to distinguish between surfaces, detect curbs, etc.**: not a problem either, because if Tesla's camera FSD system is calibrated for large objects that LIDAR sees well, it works for small objects and surface features as well.
- **Necessity of LIDAR units to be mounted high at the top of the vehicle to maximize angular resolution & object detection - hurting aerodynamic profile and efficiency:** not a problem, as the energy efficiency of R&D cars is immaterial.

Basically all of the disadvantages of LIDAR go away in an R&D setup - which is why so many autonomous vehicles startups got caught in the ""LIDAR trap"".",,

As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking.",nh2yi0,SQM and lithium demand

Chile is in a better economic situation than many other Latin countries, but it's not clear how long that will hold, particularly with the new party coming into power and the people becoming increasingly restless for major political and economic reforms.

My point was, those who choose not to invest might still believe the price might go up, in the short term of course, but the reason they don’t is because they don’t trust the company, the board of directors which is partly made up of CCP members, and the CCP itself which pretty much has entire control over the company, so in the longer term, it is not a fundamentally good company to invest in.

However if you look at the debt many Americans have, and the amount these companies are offering to attract employees, I don’t believe it’s inflationary. The minimum wage if it kept up with inflation properly would be $24, finally getting $15 after years of underpayment doesn’t undo the residual damage. In addition, $15 an hour still isn’t much in most areas. And you’re still bogged down from years of incurring debt, or not being able to save. Then we have the eviction moratorium still active and student loans not active which artificially inflated outstanding cash. I currently have $7k extra cash in my account just from loan payments I haven’t had to pay. I can’t spend that money, it’s for loans, but if you look at the money supply that’s “consumer funds and savings.” Plus, back to my earlier point about supply lines not being caused by currency inflation, the price increase from supply contraction is still very real, across utilities, groceries, transportation, and a vast number of products. That increase in prices lowers the amount you have left over to produce proper spending on consumer discretionary (which is the only spending that leads to actual inflation.) If grocery prices and electricity go up 30-40%, that is money I’m not using to shop and dine. 

I do hope that this issue leads to a more competitive environment that favors workers in all fields, but if it does cause inflation (which I doubt), it will take time.",,

They don't. It's all just a weird scare tactic that spread like a wildfire. People think they're smart when they find out about volatility drag, but it's only one small factor of a leveraged ETF.

There are risks to holding TQQQ shares, but volatility drag is negligible. Read the prospectus to get a list of risks. The one I'd be the most afraid of is a liquidity problem where the banks might not be able to fulfill their side of the swaps they sell to proshares.",,

I thought, shit this is good news. If it happens, great, if not oh well… so I quickly bought a $20 strike for the following day. 

Realizing the news would be better the following week, I bought a 2nd option at $20 for May 28. 

The first was executed because E*TRADE automatically executes a contract if you’re in the money at close, which I was. So that was kind of dumb luck.

I ask as someone who made a good profit buying GME for $80 in mid Jan and selling when it was at $330 (sadly after the main spike and not on the way up haha, but we all one day learn that you can never perfectly time the top).

The reason I don’t believe in another GME spike is because back in January, the shorts were caught with their pants down so to speak. They had been shorting GME at the $10 (and under) range, and were caught totally unawares by the price being driven 1000%+ from where it was when they shorted. 

My current belief is that these shorts (who, lets face it, are sophisticated and experienced traders who have now had months to plan and prepare their GME strategy) go in cycles of buying at the lows, helping retail drive the price up, selling those shares at the top for a profit and then opening new shorts and profiting on those as the price drops. Rinse and repeat forever for infinite money. 

In my mind, the fact that there is a high SI% means a lot less when the current price is $150 and they shorted at $170, compared to when they shorted at $5 and the price was now $200.  Plus, we saw that they are willing to literally switch off retail traders if the hedge funds need that to cover as a last resort.

I’d welcome you to challenge that view point because maybe there are other factors I haven’t considered, but my opinion is that most of the current GME diamond handers haven’t considered a factor other than “high SI%” or other people’s DDs, without considering what’s changed since January.

Either way - best of luck and don’t invest so much in GME that if it never spikes, you’re screwed.",,

Basically if an index is negative over a period a 3x leveraged fund could lose more than 3x over the same timeframe.

[This article from the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/files/DERA_LETF_Economics_Note_Nov2019.pdf) puts it another way and shows how the risk profile of these leveraged ETFs is basically the same as buying options. Not saying options are evil, but you (presumably) wouldn't fill up your portfolio with options and treat it as a set and forget investment like a standard index tracking ETF, right?

Remember that our markets have been on a tear since \~2009 thanks to QE, so the 10yr performance of a 3X leveraged fund can look deceptively consistent. Also, most of these leveraged funds haven't existed before that time so there's little hard data on the losses they can incur during a bear market.",,
