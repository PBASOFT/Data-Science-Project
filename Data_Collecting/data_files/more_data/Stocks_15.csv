19,,2021-05-21 18:39:05,t3_nhzmj6,,stocks,"Started trading options January. Read that entire thetagang wiki. Became obsessed and watched maybe 80 videos explaining the math. So please correct my thinking / rationale. 

I have a core position that I will never sell until 60 (+30 years from now). Consists of : AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, VTI, ARKK, ARKG, ARKF. Keep adding on 5% dips (except Arks). 
_______
Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

But history has taught us that companies with much more experience in software related industries have failed spectacularly when they tried to expand into gaming. It's a ruthless industry and it is very difficult for newcomers to enter. IP legacy is a huge deal for a new player to overcome, most gamers won't touch a game that is called ""mafia cities"" or ""generic racing game N1"", they will prefer the tested GTA 6 and Forza/grand turismo. Hard for them to enter the developer/publisher market because of that. The last one that did it was Microsoft and they have devoted huge amounts of recourses to do it.

Them trying to enter the platform market will be equally difficult. Epic is trying for a while with moderate success, while also investing so much to it.

Could they go the cloud gaming route? They could but still Microsoft could do it much better than them if they wanted.

Let's do some quick math as an example. With a yearly dividend of $1.64, 20 shares nets you a quarterly dividend of  $8.40 ($33.60 per year). KO stock is currently hovering around $55 and had an all-time high of $60. There's not going to be a whole lot of growth unless something big changes at Coca-Cola so let's just assume it ping-pongs between $55-58 over a year. You're pretty much gaining only like $60 on the total stock value ($55 to $58 x 20 shares) and $33.60 from dividends. In other words, you're up about $94 after a year on an investment of $1080. 

Earning money is good and all, but I think you could do WAY better by investing that $1080 into something that has higher growth potential long term. If you had the capacity to buy something like 2-3K shares at once now we're talking, but at really low share numbers it's not really worth it. 

If you don't have anything you want to invest in right now it's fine to park money in a dividend stock, but be sure to prioritize whatever makes sense for your investment horizon. As young person getting into it, the idea of dividends is super appealing but the reality is that you need a sizable deposit for it to be worth it.",,

It’s right though, most attempts to be “ethical” are virtue signaling at best. Small companies that offer “fair trade” goods are about as close as you can get and their prices are either sky high or the profit margins are small or both. The result is that only the rich can buy ethically and this limits any growth. 

Anyway, personally I operate under sort of an ethical “drawing the line” approach. It’s one thing to take advantage of cheap labor abroad and another thing to sell bombs that kill children IMO. I know there’s an argument to be made for complete nihilism/apathy, but that’s just me. You do you",,

When I got it, I understood that Enhanced Autopilot or FSD didn't mean that the car wouldn't be able to _fully self-drive_ itself today, but it was expected to do so in the future. If Tesla fails to deliver, I can see how that's a bit of a swindle, but as I've said before I am quite impressed with what has been delivered so far.

I'm sure Elon is very confident in the progress they have made in fully autonomous driving in private lots, but I agree, there are concerns, legal and otherwise, about fully autonomous driving on public roads.

It's speculation, but I from my experience driving his cars, I expect he will deliver, but when exactly, I can't say. I also don't think I'd feel comfortable riding in the backseat without a driver in the next decade, or perhaps ever. Having someone able to intervene in emergency situations is a sensible idea. But also, driving a Tesla is fun. I don't think I'd want to stop co-piloting a Tesla, even if it was safe. Driving is dangerous, but most of the danger comes from all the _other_ drivers in the road. I won't drive a motorcycle for the same reason. Even if I'm an A+ motorcycle driver, it's the less responsible _other_ drivers that may ruin my day.

However, I would feel comfortable driving to an airport and sending my car back home without passengers. Or, going to a theme park and sending my car off to find a parking spot. The car will patently, slowly, and safely drive it self. If there was an accident, it would be a minor fender bender, not a high speed fiery crash.

I'm quite confident in its ability to navigate freeways and most city streets, but I still don't trust it to navigate certain curvy mountain roads. I believe the hardware is capable, but the software is not there yet.",,

> The German newspaper Handelsblatt was the first to report on the PIK's research, which in turn sparked Diess's Twitter post, stating (in German) ""Such fuels as a universal climate solution are a bit of a false promise. While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification. Hydrogen-based fuels are likely to be very scarce and uncompetitive for at least another decade.""

And:

> Diess's Twitter post was supported by Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who also takes a firm stance on electric batteries as the method to power EVs. Musk wrote on Twitter that ""Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars.

while that's true in a vacuum, in practice it doesn't necessarily end up working that clean.

if stock is at $600 and a 4:1 split gets announced, it might run up to $800 by the time the split happens off of all the hype.

once the split happens, then it would be $200 a share, but post split stocks have a tendency to drop and that $200/share could quickly decay into $150/share or lower. 

remember all the people who bought tsla for like 2500 at the height of the pre-split runup and then were talking  about how much money the lost in the short term over the next month or two?

Instead of your strategy of cash secured puts. I would flip the script and sell covered calls on your core holdings. Right now as constructed if your portfolio took a dive your puts would be triggered and you would have to wire money from your bank account to cover your margin.

Doing refi and cash strapped so I missed it.  Plenty of fish in the sea.   One of my bankers has really done a great job but is conservative and for most of that, its a good play and position.  However, these sayings:  ""You can not time the market"".  ""You need to balance your portfolio"".  You buy all of the time and ""dollar cost Average"".  That's all rubbish in my opinion.  I believe that you must time the market and be intelligent in your decisions.  Take emotion out of it.  Balancing a portfolio of stocks means that you water down good investments and balancing means that you want average returns.  If you want average, buy market index funds and forget about it like QQQ's.  Dollar cost averaging means you are too lazy and are being a sheep.

You often want to buy when others are selling.  You want to sell when everyone is recommending the stock(s).  Example is MRVL.  They were crushed 5 years back and market CAP and cash on hand was almost the same amount.  Cramer and the ""pros"" hated it.   Stock was $6.50/$7 range.  All was negative.

TSLA is more valuable than the biggest car makers in the world. You ought to work out the cash flow required to make TSLA ratios become reasonable. Or you should figure out the share price to make the ratios reasonable. You could also ask yourself how much money tesla needs to make to justify this current price.

367,,2021-05-21 21:03:02,t3_ni2ty8,,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.
* Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million. The company has recently been making a big push into the world of wearable AR technology.
* China's internet watchdog said on Friday that companies including ByteDance, Baidu, and Microsoft (MSFT) improperly collected user data in the country.
* Yesterday, the US Department of Treasury announced it was taking steps to crackdown on digital assets by requiring any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* China’s Financial Stability and Development Commission, which is chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, released a statement today saying it is necessary to “crack down on digital asset mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.”

One strategy I use to avoid emotionally selling at a loss is to stubbornly refuse to sell until a stock gains again. I’m not recommending it for you, because I don’t know your personality, but it works for me. I’ve only been investing for less than two months, and I’ve already had at least three stocks climb back from losses before I dumped them for minor profits. (Of course, this hasn’t worked for every stock; some are still deep in the red, and I still curse them out every day, asking them why they won’t swing upward.)

Another strategy? Understand that investing is a long-term game. Once you’ve developed that long-term outlook (and this can take a while), you’ll start to see losses as temporary hiccups rather than doomsday.

484,gyzoxsr,2021-05-21 21:48:36,t1_gyzoxsr,t3_nhw5ak,stocks,"Been investing on and off in precious metal stocks for over a decade.  Quick thoughts:

Large gold producers: NEM, AEM, KL, AU, GOLD.  NEM pays a pretty good dividend, especially for this sector.  I used to hold GOLD, but don't anymore: it seems to chronically underperform the rest of the sector and fall harder when the sector hits a downturn.

Small-mid gold producers: AUY, KGC, SSRM, EGO, HMY.  Pick one based on which seems to be the cheapest of the bunch at a given time.

Larger silver producers: PAAS, AG, HL.  PAAS is the most stable of the bunch, AG has a lot of buzz behind it and will be a great momentum play if silver really takes off (it was one of the stocks Robinhood blocked trading off back during the Gamestop short squeeze). HL moves a lot and can be a good trading stock.

Smaller silver producers: CDE, EXK, MAG, SVM, FSM, SILV.  Most of these stocks have had big run ups recently and are pretty high priced.  FSM is the exception because it just acquired a junior miner and took a big hit for it, could be a good buy at this price.  SVM has a solid balance sheet, but tends to lag because its mines are based in China.  I think it'll catch up once silver starts moving up.

Streaming companies: WPM, RGLD, FNV, SAND, OR.  These companies don't operate mines, but fund mining operations in exchange for a share of the mine's revenue or production.  Less risk and exposure means less movement in the price, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your goals.",,

There is no TV anymore. Those days are over and there is no easy way to target young kids. 

Your best bet is Youtube but good luck with that. Many of us parents dont allow Youtube for our younger kids for obvious reasons. And once they are old enough those shows will be to kiddie for them. 

Today everything is on demand and really the big names there are Netflix, Disney, and Amazon. Do they even offer those shows? I think there is a new pony show on netflix but I have all boys so no one watches that. I have never seen the others though I never bothered to search either.

I do think that some toys will always be around. Nerf is great. Monopoly and other board games are staples but you are also competing with apps now... The card games might still be around but I dont think those make much and are really targeted for hobbyists more than kids.

he's correct. ETFs are not perfect. there are possible problems, including fees and tracking error. listen to dad on this. with ETFs you always pay the annual management fee + the difference in the bid/ask spread every time you buy. with high-volume ETFs the spread is a penny or less, but low-volume ETFs can have a substantial spread that amounts to a front-load fee and a redemption fee.

What about Marvel or Star Wars?  Hasbro owns Marvel Legends and has exclusive rights to Satr Wars toys.

Hasbro owns 40% of Discovery Family, which is youth oriented, and has a presence on Hulu. 

Did you ask your kids these questions?  These brands are not TV shows.  They touch every space in entertainment.  Movies, toys, video games, pop culture, retail, cafes, amusement park rides, YouTube channels, experiences and anything related to children.  

Do your kids know Peppa Pig? What about PJ Masks? How about Frozen?  Play doh? 

I fail to believe your children don't know the largest grossing media franchise in the world - Pokémon. They have never heard of Pikachu? The 2019 movie grossed 430M.  In total, their movies have grossed almost 2B.  Pokémon is cards, video games, pop culture, movies, toys, YouTube channels, anime, TV shows and mo.

> Toys... I wouldnt be so sure. Look what happened to Mattel and their brands are even better than Hasbro thanks to video game and movie tie ins.


This seems like a very close minded answer as to what Hasbro does and how far reaching its brands are.  I'm sure people will stop playing with toys.  

Mattel does not have better brands - its proven in the history.  Hasbro is up 113% over the last 10 years.  Mattel is down 16% over the same period.  Mattel also stopped its dividend in 2017, Hasbro continues to pay dividends at a 3.4% clip.",,

If there were a debt free business in your local neighborhood that held $100,000 in assets and it was being managed by a fool who was expected to run it into the ground at a steady decline over the following 5 years, it could be argued that a slice of that pie is worth $0 \*today\*.

This company has experienced year-over-year losses (losing money every year these last 5 years). So...the current pricing makes sense in that light.

You should probably look at index funds. They are very low cost, diversified, and passively follow specific segments of the market. This makes it easy to track the market’s overall performance rather than relying on stock picking, which can be very risky.

Depending on the brokerage you use, each one has similar products. The total US stock market fund at Fidelity is FSKAX. It’s VTSAX at Vanguard, and SWTSX at Schwab.

S&P 500 index funds at these brokers are FXAIX, VTIAX, and SWPPX respectively. 

An ETF is a fund that may be traded in real time like a stock. Many of the same products are available in ETF form. VTI is the Vanguard total US market ETF. VOO is their S&P 500 ETF.

They simply look at the features items on the front page. So no front page = no exposure of any kind. 

Movies... unless its Disney no one has ever asked us to go to the movies otherwise and the only reason they know those is because of the wife (lol). 

I am not saying they dont like toys... they are spoiled as hell. But those old brands are just not strong any more. Not like in our childhood when we were exploited (double lol). 

If I had to say which toys are king I would say video games are #1 followed by Lego (or building blocks, brand doesnt matter) and then activity equipment like bikes, scooters, squirt guns. Might include nerf with the 3rd category. We have some Disney stuff (again... wife) and Star Wars stuff (thats me) but Ive maybe spent a total of $100 combined across 3 boys on SW and Disney stuff... They just dont care about it.

As for brands...

* Transformers - no. They couldnt make it through an episode of the new show. They cant name any Transformers.
* Peppa Pig - Yes but no one has ever asked for a toy. 
* PJ Mask - Yes but no one has ever asked for a toy.
* Disney stuff - Yes but Mattel also has Disney toys too.
* Pokemon - no even though I have seen it on streaming a few times. Dont see kids wearing any pokemon stuff at schools either.
* Play Doh - brand is irrelevant. 
* Marvel/DC - sort of. There is a Teen Titans show and game that they liked. But Marvel has almost no recognition despite being on Disney+. They just never watch the shows and prefer the movies like Toy Story or musicals even though they never ask for the toys...
* Star Wars - yes because of me... but they really only know Luke, Vader, C3PO and R2D2.

This week, the next Papa of EV World, Herbert Diess, referenced this bit of news from earlier this month:

[Hydrogen instead of electrification? Potentials and risks for climate targets](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/hydrogen-instead-of-electrification-potentials-and-risks-for-climate-targets)

The CEO of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, stated that hydrogen fuel cell technology is not feasible for at least a decade:

[https://interestingengineering.com/vw-ceo-says-electric-batteries-are-better-than-hydrogen-cars](VW CEO Says Electric Batteries Are Better than Hydrogen Cars)

> The German newspaper Handelsblatt was the first to report on the PIK's research, which in turn sparked Diess's Twitter post, stating (in German) ""Such fuels as a universal climate solution are a bit of a false promise. While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification. Hydrogen-based fuels are likely to be very scarce and uncompetitive for at least another decade.""

And just yesterday, the original Papa of EV World, Elon Musk, agreed.

> Diess's Twitter post was supported by Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who also takes a firm stance on electric batteries as the method to power EVs. Musk wrote on Twitter that ""Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use.""

Lithium ion batteries are essentially a 30 year old invention in the form we know them today, and they’re at their very limit. They’re only advantage is that they had the head start and have a relatively widespread applications today, But their properties simply don’t compare to the energy properties of hydrogen in terms of flexibility of application. 

I mean there are companies making high quality graphene and hydrogen from natural gas cracking, an extremely basic chemical process (complex to innovate and optimize though) the prevalence and extraction of natural gas is extremely broad today and the issues you cite are not different form the problems presented at the onset of widespread LNG use, it was essentially an economic blue print for a better form of itself. Where it really takes the cake is when cracking uses renewable energy and produces no CO2 when moisture is not present during cracking. Not to mention batteries are too heavy to use for flight and high power applications like mining trucks and ocean traversing ships already use the best available fuel cells.

Here is my question. 

I have a Roth IRA through Vanguard. I chose the Target Retirement 2050 fund. I am able to max this out every year. I wanted to start investing more and opened an account with Merrill. My  plan, so far, is:

60% ETF’s 
Within that 60%, 50% is growth and 50% is speculative.

40% Individual Stocks
Within that 40%, 50% growth and 50% speculative. 

Question 1.) Is this a good plan? I have a tendency to overthink and over complicate things. 

Question 2.) For my growth ETF positions, I already have some shares of VTI. Is this position redundant since my Roth IRA is Vanguard Target Retirement 2045(which I max out.) From what I can read, the 2045 target retirements holdings are 50% VTI. If it is redundant, would anyone happen to have a recommendation for growth ETF that would offer different exposure.

My suggestion is put into an S&P500 index fund every month. It doesn't have to be a lot, perhaps start with $50, just what you are comfortable. Then think of it as lost money - money you can't get back and will sit there until retirement. If you are able to hold through a drop and ride the gains once the economy turns around, you will come to psychologically handle down times.

As a heads up though, if you play in the markets, you WILL make bad investments. You WILL at times feel stupid losing money. There is no getting around it. The only thing  that changes as you gain experience is your risk appetite.",,

The science part is the actual modeling, the art is the underlying assumptions.  I will give a simple example (FYI I just did this for a client the other day).  They wanted to forecast revenue for 3 years for a software product they are building. They charge their customers by the number of units that the software utilizes, and they gave me their model, and my job was to improve it so that they could present it to investors.  It was an entire biz model, but for here let’s just assume it was revenue only.  Here are the questions I asked, which were asked to test the underlying assumptions of their forecast. 

1. Is the price that you charge competitive with the market?
2. Is your product better or disruptive to the market therefore demanding a higher price?
3. Is your product commoditized which means you are only competing on price?
4. How many customers are in the market and how many are you acquiring and how quickly?
5. Does the number of customers that being acquired make sense?

There were more questions but this gives a general idea.  Based on these answers the model can be fine tuned, or built from scratch.  The more we understand the underlying business, the better we can financial model.",,

So pay attention to wait two days before selling a stock you just bought; better yet, 3 days.

I often buy stocks 100 or 200 shares at a time and add 100-200 shares of the same stock a couple days later.  I have my default set FIFO, so if I have the unusual opportunity to take profit on a pop, I can sell 100 or 200 shares the day or day after I bought the new  shares, knowing the first shares I bought are paid for (cleared).

984,,2021-05-22 02:09:19,t3_ni8fp6,,stocks,"Are there any stocks in your portfolio right now that have been disappointing so far, but they don’t frustrate you as much because you’re hopeful that they’ll turn it around at some point in the foreseeable future? Also, for those who’ve invested for several years, have there been any stocks from your past that fit this category? If so, what did you eventually do with those stocks?

I’m only less than two months into my investing journey, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but my top three so far are…

3) MA - Talk about a stock that swings wildly. At its peak, MasterCard was as high as +300 for me. At its bottom, it fell to almost -200. Right now it’s sitting at around -100. I saw MA’s chart before I bought, and I noticed the wild price swings, but I also saw the general upward trend of higher highs and lows, which is why I’m not worried about its ability to eventually recover again.

2) SBUX - The stock was climbing from the moment I bought it…until its earnings report. Then it recovered. Then it didn’t. Yet despite its ridiculously high P/E ratio, it’s Starbucks. Its brand is as loud as Coca-Cola or Disney. I doubt it stays down for long.

1) OPY - When I was trying to find undervalued stocks, Oppenheimer’s numbers made it an attractive buy. Then the recent panic over inflation hit, and OPY wasn’t immune from the fall. Still, all indicators point to it being undervalued, and it’s already shown the ability to recover at least once. It seems as though I just got in at a bad time.",ni8fp6,“Disappointing but hopeful” stocks you hold
