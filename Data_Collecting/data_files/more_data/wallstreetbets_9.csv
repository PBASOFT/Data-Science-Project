The Mormon church was created for old perverts to fuck little girls

Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids. 

Heber C Kimball ended up with 43 girls to fuck by the time he died. All he had to do is give up his 14 year old daughter Helen to be raped by a pervert until he died

I think you are very confused. Halal is slaughtering in the name of God and letting the animal bleed out. 

It's why Muslims can consume kosher meat and vice versa.

So the local Muslim butcher doesn't have to pay, but KFC dies if they want to use the sign from that specific company. In the UK there is two large companies offering these labels.",,

Can you give me some biblical instances on that? I can share several about the love of money and the rich man getting into heaven. It's funny, it's almost like they preach something different then the bible and book of Mormon. 

So, let's go in on that $40 million donation yearly. The church annual income is 14 billion. That's 0.3% of their yearly income. So, that means the average american would only have to give $120 a year to match them. Seems a bit short of the ten percent required by members.",,

They both pay the same price for gas, yet the 45k a year driver pays a higher percentage of their income for gas. Inflation is brutal and is rearing its ugly head. 30 year mortage in 1981 was 16.5%.

Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids. 

Heber C Kimball ended up with 43 girls to fuck by the time he died. All he had to do is give up his 14 year old daughter Helen to be raped by a pervert until he died

Retards.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end trading with some of the dumbest, most mentally crippling strategies. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little reddit karma for saying we did.

We'll punish our accounts doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time on hold with Robinhood support all to avoid a single extra cent per trade.

Many of us have lost careers from doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same options over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know every little detail such that some have attained such trader nirvana that they can literally lose money blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many accounts have been wiped, margins called, families and marriages destroyed in retardation? All to later be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They short our stocks? We're already raising the price without them. They take our brokers? Traders aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even founding brokerages our selves. They think calling us broke, poor, delusional is going to change us? We've been called worse things by our fellow retards with trading accounts in the negatives. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to losing money. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challenge when they tell us the squeeze has been squoze. Our obsession with proving we can still lose money after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big banks and brokerages laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed retardflex.

Traders are retarded, hard core, by nature. We love a challenge. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challenge us. You're not $TSLA, you're not $LULU, you're not $MU; this is just another meme stock.",,

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there‚Äôs anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I‚Äôm interested in hearing other opinions on this.

Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

# TA Notes:

* Bulls need to keep it above 415
* Look for some resistance around 417-418
* Major residences at 420
* Bears need to. hold 417-418 and then plow through 415 support
* Bullish pt: 419.29 - 420 - 421.20 - 422.71
* Bearish pt: 413.67 - 412.49 - 411 - 410

# 1D Timeframe Note

* Tested bottom range of gap fill for support.
* If it fails we may see the second half of the w-shape recovery form. We could see a few days of downside if we close below 415 IMO.

1444,,2021-05-18 14:07:41,t3_nfbmkd,,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Poohüêª. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU‚Äôs revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I‚Äôm very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm here with another DD, but this time it‚Äôll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I‚Äôve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DD
1445,,2021-05-18 14:19:53,t3_nfbwv5,,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,UWMC has a business model that should weather the storm much better.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,$AMC TA - BROKE OUT BIG LAST WEEK - BEST SETUP SINCE THE FIRST SQUEEZE - NEEDS TO BREAK KEY RESISTANCE FOR ROCKETS THRUSTERS TO ENGAGE AGAIN

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvhxo3dnl1071.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=546d9684c02c4da0a25f4887c727d8c893c3224b

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

You attend meetings in some dude's basement that you're pretty sure is used for either ritual sacrifices or weird sex shit based on how it's dimly lit by candles and the iron handcuffs hanging from the ceilings. You roll your eyes every time the guy in the blood red cloak and hood talks about the rewards you'll receive in the afterlife if you just pledge your loyalty and donate your wealth to the cult. Your friends and family all make fun of you and call you a dumbass. 

A couple months later, you don't know how things got so out of hand but you're being pressured by the entire cult to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with them so you can all ascend to the promised land. You decide fuck it, you already lost your life savings in OTM FD's and the rest went to the cult so you could keep banging the same chick, who's been passed around multiple other members, and you've been pretty depressed so what do you have to lose? You chug down your portion out of a plastic Chuck-e-Cheese mug and then die in agony.

Pitch black nothingness. All of a sudden you feel warm sunshine on your face and smell a fresh ocean breeze mixed with the scent of mom's cinnamon buns. You open your eyes and wake up in the muscular arms of the god Thor. He whispers into your ears, ""It was all true, welcome to Valhalla."" He leads you to your yacht where you find 100 big bosomed women, every single one the most gorgeous you've ever seen, and all desperate to snort your unlimited supply of cocaine off your massive 12"" penis (you were only 3"" before). And this is exactly what it feels like to own shares of GME.",,

When somebody puts a bid in higher than the current one that doesn‚Äôt get filled, in theory that should tighten the spread and increase the quoted value of the call...so long as the bid for the lowest ask doesn‚Äôt change with it.

Likewise, the opposite happens if somebody buys in an order to sell an option for less than the lowest price.

Did Jesus tell the sick and needy to come to him for help, or was it only the worthy, 10 percent tithe payers? The fact that you DON'T see an issue with this tells me everything I need to know about your character: ""The church will never be wrong and no matter what they do you'll find a way to support it.""

And you are seriously defending people having to pay money out of their own pockets to ""serve"" a mission for this church worth $100 billion? Where missionaries don't even get to choose where to go, who their companions are, etc? A church that sends young men and women out to preach the gospel without teaching them the full history of the chruch? I was on my mission when I learned Joseph Smith had 40+ wives, that he used to be a treasure hunter before he founded the church, that he translated the book of mormon using a rock in a hat, that he had 4 different accounts of the first vision, etc etc etc etc. Imagine my shock when that turned out to be 100 percent true, and I never knew any of it after being a lifelong member! You don't see ANY problem with this, at all? A church that hides or misrepresents its true history is most ASSUREDLY the Lord's church, alright ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

| ""And tithing isn‚Äôt a threat. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúif then‚Äù statement. If you don‚Äôt want to pay tithing that‚Äôs fine, but you can‚Äôt claim what only comes to people who do. To act like you can dictate to deity how he should act is simply narcissistic.""  


You literally CANNOT go to the temple if you aren't a full-tithe payer. Which means you CANNOT participate in the saving ordinances that allow you to go to the celestial kingdom and be with your family for eternity. And you dare to claim that tithing ISN'T a threat? HOW?!?!? Please use common sense and tell me how that's not a threat. It's as simple as this:

  
A) Pay tithing and you can go to the temple

OR

B) Don't pay tithing, and you are not worthy to go to the temple, and therefore cannot participate in the saving ordinances.

That is 100% a threat, they are holding your salvation hostage for 10% of your income. There is no amount of mental gymnastics you can perform to change that fact. And you still defend this practice, because you've been taught that the church can do no wrong, that the leaders are always correct, and that you cannot criticize your leaders. I'll do it for you: THIS CHURCH IS AN ABOMINATON AND A BLIGHT ON THE WORLD. If Jesus was real, he would smite this organization to the ground and burn it for eternity. No organization that claims to speak as the one true church of the lord would ignore the needs of so many people around them while hoarding real estate and mountains of cash.   


I used to be a defender of the church as well. I get it. I got so sick of people speaking bad about my church because, as a member, I REALLY knew what the church taught. I honestly get it. However, I also know what it's like to be forced to peek outside the bubble, and follow facts and history to determine truth instead of what one religion tells me to believe. It's hard learning that the church you grew up respecting is literally nothing like what it is in reality. I truly hope you can find your way out of the cult someday.

Founder Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids

Heber C Kimball ended up with 43 girls to fuck by the time he died. All he had to do is give up his 14 year old daughter Helen to be raped by a pervert until he died

# TA Notes:

* Bulls need to keep it above 415
* Look for some resistance around 417-418
* Major residences at 420
* Bears need to. hold 417-418 and then plow through 415 support
* Bullish pt: 419.29 - 420 - 421.20 - 422.71
* Bearish pt: 413.67 - 412.49 - 411 - 410

# 1D Timeframe Note

* Tested bottom range of gap fill for support.
* If it fails we may see the second half of the w-shape recovery form. We could see a few days of downside if we close below 415 IMO.

One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU‚Äôs revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I‚Äôm very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm here with another DD, but this time it‚Äôll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I‚Äôve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DD
2571,,2021-05-18 14:19:53,t3_nfbwv5,,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,UWMC has a business model that should weather the storm much better.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,$AMC TA - BROKE OUT BIG LAST WEEK - BEST SETUP SINCE THE FIRST SQUEEZE - NEEDS TO BREAK KEY RESISTANCE FOR ROCKETS THRUSTERS TO ENGAGE AGAIN
2575,,2021-05-18 17:50:03,t3_nfh8o2,,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

Positions:

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c.",ng50po,GLD and GOLD. Useless crap but it's all about the narrative.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvhxo3dnl1071.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=546d9684c02c4da0a25f4887c727d8c893c3224b

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

Lynas Corp. is the only non-Chinese processor of rare-earth metals that processes any appreciable amount of rare earth metal and is poised for major expansion. Lynas has received two major funding awards from the US Federal Government to build rare earth element processing facilities in Texas.Looking to break the commie Chinese stranglehold on the rare earth industry, there is great bi-partisan support in Congress, from the President and the Pentagon to reestablish a strong and robust American rare earth metal mining and processing industry. [When a handful of senators objected to one of the Pentagon awards due to Lynas being an Australian company, the funding award was given anyway after the Pentagon pressed for the project to move forward.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rareearths-idUSKCN24M2Z4) Given the divisive political situation today, its rare to see such strong bi-partisan unity behind any issue, and as the sole non-Chinese company with any real experience in the industry Lynas is poised to reap the benefits so long as America and China remain at odds. Other non-Chinese companies, such as MP Materials, are looking at jumping into processing, but none to my knowledge are actual yet doing so. Needless to say, I‚Äôm long on Lynas, I‚Äôve linked some articles below as references for my statements above, but don‚Äôt take my word for it, do your own due diligence!

2642,,2021-05-19 15:44:46,t3_ng99i7,,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

***Positions -***

$GLD **180**c for July @ **1.94** \- 

I plan to roll them back as time passes. I don't like to let my options get below 45 DTE",ng99i7,$GC (GLD/IAU/GOLD) TA - Breaking a 10 Year Old Pattern - Lot's of Confluence - Weekly Close for Confirmation

Back in the days when those teachings were being taught they didn't have nearly any of the things or responsibilites we have now. It's a completely different atmosphere. They're given a yearly stipend so that when they are off traveling across the world their families are taken care of. They don't live in the lap of luxury and they're definitely not getting rich off of it. And any wealth they do have came from their professions or books they write.

Tithing is a spiritual law, not a physical law. God does not need our money. He gives us the commandment to pay tithing to increase our faith and keep our focus on Him. Obedience brings blessings. A lot of our commandments are for us and our *spiritual* growth. And almost all if not all of the Q15 have struggled financially at some point in their lives. I just listened to an Elder Holland talk, thst he gave many years after the fact, talking about his struggles as a young father, financially and emotionally. They remember. They understand. They are not heartless leaders sitting atop their towers basking in their wealth. They are constantly among members, visiting members, and staying with members. 

Yes, the local leaders of the church give exorbitantly of their time without financial compensation and it's very difficult. I don't have any response to that, although as a Young Women president, the thought of being paid or wanting to be paid or thinking I deserved to get paid because of my service never even came close to my thoughts. I don't serve for the money. Bishops and stake presidents though are crazy busy, I don't know how they feel about wanting compensation.

A janitor would be nice. I have found the very few times I have cleaned the church, it helps me realize what it takes to maintain those buildings and gives me more respect for them and helps me treat them with that respect. Amd the ome time I was able to clean the temple, I absolutely loved it and was glad I had the chance to do it.

The problem with people who have left the church is they tend to forget that members are more focused on the spirtual aspect of the church and not the physical. The church is a spiritual entity navigating a physical world.",,

Q1 2021 results in-line with expectations. Cash balance of $985 million. Increasing full-year operating expense guidance range by $30 million to include PEAR program costs (explicitly excluded from prior guidance). Capital expenditure guidance unchanged.

Majority of Fisker Ocean Bill of Material (BOM) now sourced, improving cost visibility across the entire model range at targets previously communicated. 

Foxconn binding agreement completed and initial production in U.S. confirmed. Design of PEAR vehicle locked and program concept phase kicked off. Several suppliers already nominated and the program is benefiting from meaningful supply chain synergies with Ocean.

Reservations total more than 16,000 as of today. More than 50% of reservation-holders are from outside the SUV segment, indicating a potentially larger addressable market than expected.

Talent acquisition accelerated in 2021, with a total of 203 full-time employees onboard as of today, compared to 101 as of December 31, 2020.

From what I‚Äôve found through some deep dives done by parties outside the meme stock craze (papers were written years ago after 08/09) it‚Äôs absolutely bananas what these guys are allowed to het away with.  

Unfortunately the only way (two ways Ill explain the other later) right now to trace the synthetic shares to the creators is by going over every day‚Äôs transactions for the last decade trade by trade then sue the creators for dillution. They hide it way to trick the systems so they can‚Äôt be tracked.  

Good news for us is we‚Äôve made such a big deal out of it there are teams of lawyers already doing that for the lawsuits that will happen.  Probably start after the June 2 share count. 

Better news is Amc is a dividend company, which means as soon as they start handing them out again even if it‚Äôs a penny a share.  The creators of the synthetic shares are obligated to pay that dividend.  That leaves a money trail.

It shouldn't be complicated 

Consider it from the perspective that maybe, just *maybeeee*, the holy ghost isn't talking to you. Or maybe doesn't exist at all

>So you‚Äôre saying that the promptings felt continue to prove to us a perspective in which we only take in information that agrees with what we believe?

I'm saying that humans have conscious thought 

>I mean, yeah? lol that‚Äôs what faith is. You wanna call it confirmation bias have at it homie

But your faith is in a religion with a disgusting history. Why? 

>And sure our conscience plays a role (light of Christ) as well as humans have the innate desire to do good, but the Holy Ghost plays off of that to continue to guide us in the right direction.

While I had ""the gift of the holy ghost"", I was constantly prompted to leave Mormonism. The still small voice was always letting me know that Mormonism was toxic and harmful. 

Why would the holy ghost tell you and I two different things?",,

man y‚Äôall legit don‚Äôt listen. 

I dealt with the idea that i was wrong for the longest time until i realized that none of the problems that people brought up were actually problems and for the most part had reasonable explanations to them. 

Look here. There‚Äôs three perspectives about a given ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù. There‚Äôs the church one, the unbiased one, and the anti one. I read all three for a given situation. After reading all three for a decent bit of the issues i thought existed, i realized a pattern in which the dissenting perspective was full of wording and negative outlook that made the issue seem like an issue, or made it seem much worse than it in actuality was. I only realized this after looking at the unbiased facts of the story. Rarely did i ever take the church perspective until the very end where i realized it lined up considerably well with what the unbiased factual source stated. 

I did far from ‚Äúignore it‚Äù until near the end of my study when i realized said pattern.",,

The church offers millions of aid yearly to people regardless of faith. They're often the first on the scene for major disasters like hurricane katrina and have been all over the world responding to crises like the famine in Mozambique. The more you have the more you can give. The most typical reply is ""all of that doesn't cost 100 billion! they should give more!"" Well no, they invest to produce an organization capable of perpetual giving. A lot of good is being done and more can be done with more funds. No one is pocketing these funds for personal wealth. 

And why should members choose where they serve? How is that at all evidence of corruption? Not even in businesses do people choose where they go on their trips. It's called an assignment for a reason. 

""You literally CANNOT go to the temple if you aren't a full-tithe payer. Which means you CANNOT participate in the saving ordinances that allow you to go to the celestial kingdom and be with your family for eternity. And you dare to claim that tithing ISN'T a threat? HOW?!?!? Please use common sense and tell me how that's not a threat. ""

You literally CANNOT get into college if you don't submit an application + fees. You CANNOT join the American Medical Association without paying membership dues. You literally CANNOT join a fraternity without pledging, you literally CANNOT receive the blessings of following God if you don't do the things God says are required to receive them. 

These are not threats, they're conditions. Everything in life operates around conditions. If the church really is legit, then God has stated the following conditions. And if eternal life and families are really so important to you, then it's silly you'd give them up for 10% of your income. 

I'm not going to argue points about various versions of Smith's accounts since that's a common thing (eg the four gospels have plenty of discrepancies) and I wont claim to have the official stance off the top of my head.",,

And you miss the big picture. If your income was 0 then you'd still be a full tithe payer without paying a cent.

Haha okay. So you believe our thoughts are only coming from the holy ghost if they're telling us to do the things Mormonism taught us, like not to leave Mormonism. 

Do you not see the problem here? Lol

I don‚Äôt think leaders excommunicate people who are in line with the thinking that Christ is okay with Gays. I would think He‚Äôs okay with them considering the doctrines He teaches. Not even to mention the story of the Woman caught in Adultery. He was worthy to cast a stone at her as taught in the Law of Moses but still didn‚Äôt.

Off of that, i believe the Holy Ghost directs us to do Gods will, so good things in a general sense. Good is also based on the individual except for morally right and wrong ideas, again, if that makes sense. What‚Äôs good for me and what‚Äôs good for you have some overlap but not exactly the same. 

I still don‚Äôt think Holy Ghost = Confirmation bias

I see the idea you‚Äôre trying to get at, but it‚Äôs not really what i believe or feel like most people in my faith believe. I feel like our conscience and thoughts play a role, idk what, but they exist. 

Honestly this is all getting really convoluted in my head so none of that probably made sense tbh. 

Idk, getting down to it, this religion makes sense to me and there‚Äôs not much that can dissuade me away from it.",,

But assuming I'm replying to the right comment chain here, thanks for clarifying. Yea, sure if you are standing from the outside then I can see why you'd protest a religion that takes money for fake problems. However your other thread is challenging the internal logic within the religion, which I addressed. Your reply of ""lol okay bud"" was ... not very informative :) 

But that's the core element of any religion, that if you believe it, then you have to evaluate if the internal theology makes sense. No one is profiting off of the reserve fund. The 6 billion dollar expenses cover operating costs for 31,000 congregations, activities, education subsidies etc. The invested remaining 1 billion  (tithing surplus) that is now a multi billion dollar fund shows no evidence of profiting either. So honestly, it doesn't seem all that weird. As far as we can tell, funds, even if currently held in reserve, really all do go towards building the church. 

Bottom line is these people genuinely believe that there is a way to know what happens afterwards. And while you're entitled to their opinion, they are as well.",,

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

Positions:

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c.",ng50po,GLD and GOLD. Useless crap but it's all about the narrative.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

Now lets look at FINTEL and see which institutions are shorting $CLOV. 

&#x200B;

[BOA is there huh?  Citadel too? WOW. What a coincidence. What a surprise after Hindenburg's report. ](https://preview.redd.it/2sccbu1jk3071.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=62622eee1cb5100dc6f30dd6b7aa408f812055a7)

&#x200B;

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything. 

&#x200B;

[Hindenburg and they CITADEL TIES...](https://preview.redd.it/u62fbrz3k3071.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e4b188e2fcadc840acd6a28697c1258c3210c8d)

&#x200B;

Anyways, unfortunately, we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week, but we should still be BULLISH in CLOV even after all this manipulation. May 21 calls had high volume, but MM's want to make their money, and they will never allow for a run. 

The little guys(retail investors) can never win.

Hopefully.... one day this changes.",ng9j46,Why Shorts/Institutions/MMs will always win - CLOV analysis

Full disagree. You're seriously exaggerating here, imo. While there are outages, especially with Coinbase, they've got way better over the last few years. I've had maybe one or two issues over the past year. Heck, you can even use Coinbase Pro, no issues at all. I've had most of my assets on Coinbase since 2017 and don't regret it at all. 

I also don't understand what you mean by 'holding them on an exchange is a bad idea', followed by 'moving your coins to an exchange for urgent trades is extremely unreliable'. If you're holding your coins on the exchange (like coinbase), then you remove the step of moving them there in order to 'make urgent trades'.

That's because Gemini is unmitigated horseshit. I don't know how anyone can use that app for more than five minutes without immediately deleting it. I tried it out and instantly hated it, then hopped on Twitter and saw TJ Miller pimping it and it all clicked together. It's trash.",,

   Just wondering if any other E\*TRADE account holders with OTC accounts receive this email this morning?  

New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù securities, including at E\*TRADE  
  
On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for‚Äîand value of‚Äîcertain ‚Äúover-the-counter (OTC) securities‚Äù you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E\*TRADE from making these products generally available.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

They sent a link to the Amendment that was adopted last September.  I have checked a few of the stocks I hold and only ONE has met this requirement in YEARS.  Most of them penny stocks I purchased in December 2020  after the September 2020 Amendment was adopted, and are still have negative return.  

Not that today's market is not bad already, then to get this email.  All I can say, is WOW!",,

Joseph Smith did NOT choose his apostles if they had sex with young girls and then turned them over to him. That is a HUGE lie. People did not join the early church to do that, and Joseph Smith did not get shot because of this. Yes, he his friends and brothers were shot multiple times through a door in Liberty Jail, but it was because he was a ""Mormon"", and they didn't understand our beliefs. Mobs drove Smith's family from their home and they drove the entirety of the church out of their homes. This organization DOES NOT invite men to have sex with younger girls. If you don't believe me when I say that we DO NOT commit these heinous crimes, then with all due respect, please ponder who knows more about the history of my church. I have been a member for more than 16 years and find great interest in its history. I would know. :) This organization DOES NOT commit those crimes. If we did, then why aren't we all in jail? 

Secondly, people like to get all high and mighty when they hear we give 10% of our income to the church. Why do we give 10%? That tithing goes to building and maintaining our temples, buying land for those temples, maintaining church historical sites, sending out missionaries, major donation efforts, most recently one of the largest covid relief efforts created by a religious organization, maintaining our welfare program for less fortunate members, which includes a massive supply chain from our farms, church sponsored logistics teams for those efforts, the list goes on. I donate because I believe that all of those things are good things. If my money does not go to those things, it will go into church savings. And that isn't a bad thing, because if times require for action on our part my money will be used in helping others. :)

I respect you for bringing this up. Most people think that we abuse and mistreat women like this, and that is not true. If I was in your shoes I would also be upset at my religion, because you have reason to not support us if you think we commit such crimes. The fact that you are bringing this up out of concern shows that you care, and I greatly respect you for that! :)",,

legitimate ""Short Squeeze"" --  
Short Sellers sell shares to buyers at the highest available  
Bid price because they have calculated that they can buy back those shares at a  
lower price later.¬†   
For some Short Sellers there is a careful process of  
research, combing through financials, assessment of market direction,  
price-history analysis etc. which gives them a strong conviction that the stock  
that they are shorting will go down and they will make money by buying it back  
for less than they sold it for.¬† For,  
most, however, the approach is much more like a pack of hyenas following a herd  
of elephants . . . they assume that at some point, the biggest will eventually  
fall and make for a huge easy meal.  
A Short Squeeze happens when the hyenas realize that the big  
old elephant that they thought was going to be a feast turns out to only be  
napping.¬† And as the elephant rises, the  
hyenas have to make their escape.  
The only problem is, for the Short Sellers to escape, they  
have to buy back the shares that they sold at the current ASK price.¬† So as the stock rises, they are forced to  
chase the Ask up and up.¬† The fewer  
Sellers in the market place, the more desperate the Shorts are to make their  
escape.  
What we are seeing today is AMD's board saying, ""We're  
not dead, for sure.""¬† And the hyenas  
all know what that means . . . unless they are certain, they need to beat a  
hasty retreat!",,

They encourage you to save to pay for it but they will if you dont have money my apartment in one area was $2,500 a month) it also pays for the free copies of material the church gives out to people, App development to access learning material online, the website, Satellite broadcasts, family history, and other things directly related to the church and teaching people about God. Every month we have fast offerings (once a month we remember those in need by fasting either not eating 2 meals, not using your phone for the day, or whatever is a sacrifice to you to remember those who have not.) You can donate to the ""fast offerings"" which is optional and not required at all by the church but is the fund that the church uses to donate to charities or pay for food for others or donations for natural disasters which the church has donated i think over $2.3 Billion so far all paid for by the members donating to the fast offering fund.

It's hard to overstate how critical process nodes are for semiconductors. Move to a smaller node and you get more speed at less power for free - zero negative tradeoffs at least for digital. 

Intel is stuck on a node they first introduced in 2014 and planned to move off in 2016, but every attempt they've tried has failed. Not improving in 7 years is DEATH in semis. OTOH, AMD's manufacturing partner is now 3 nodes ahead of Intel. That's 3 generations worth of more speed at lower power. Even if Intel started catching up tomorrow, their technology is five years behind AMD dead minimum. 

And is Intel pulling out all the stops to catch up, seeing a life or death threat to their CPU business? Fuuuck no. They're buying back shares to bait boomer investors back in and reshuffling the C-suite. Meanwhile, AMD's manufacturing partner is investing $100 BILLION over the next 3 years to extend their lead. Semi manufacturing just might be the most capital intensive business on earth and they treat it as such.

AMD has awesome leadership (Su Bae is a PhD electrical engineer, she gets this business), low debt, a reasonable P/E, something like 6 consecutive blowout earnings reports, and they're taking share from Intel. Everything about them screams green light IMO. I have no idea why their stock is punished so much. Su Bae doesn't either, hence the buyback.


Nvidia is a really good company too with a ton of upside, but they are very expensive right now. 

TXN is a ""slow and steady"" type stock... they focus on stable, low-growth old school technology and use their expertise at boomer tech and deep vendor relationships to hang on to market share. I like them, but they're not going to grow quickly and they are already priced high. I'd buy them on a big correction dip.

Intel is dying and not even a 12 P/E can suck me back in.

Broadcom does the same thing that Qualcomm does only worse and at 2x the P/E.",,

The difference I see with this particular religion compared to so many others, is that it is SO EASILY disproven using historical data and facts. The fact that the church misrepresents its history, and hides it from its own members, or constantly changes its teachings while disavowing what previous prophets taught as scripture, is what is concerning. These members aren't being given the full picture of the religion, its history, and the circumstances surrounding its founding, so they cannot know exactly what kind of organization they are donating to. I'm not saying they church doesn't do ANY good on the planet, I know there are some people they help (though not NEARLY enough considering the virtually bottomless resources they have, but whatever). I'm saying that the only reason they amassed this wealth in the first place, was by deceiving and misleading people. I am angry that my tithing funds went to a church that spent MILLIONS trying to fight gay marriage, something it has absolutely ZERO right to do, affecting lives of non-members.  I am angry that my family continues to donate 10 percent of their income to this religion because they worry about being left behind in the afterlife, that those funds could be going towards retirement, or ACTUAL people it can help instead of a bottomless well of money the church already has. You cannot and will not convince me that this ""religion"" is anything other than a sham and an affront to what it means to represent ""god."" Like others have said, it may as well be the church of Donald Trump for all I care, it's just as sleazy.

While I'd reserve my comment why such a big topics (Kasruth) is only vaguely represented by couple of verses in Koran? You really need to at least read up Kashrut Law (try Google) as this is the original source of ""Halal"". 

That said,

NO, Halal is A LOT MORE THAN slaughtering in the name of God and letting the animal bleed out... It's supposed to be the Superfood Technology that will leave present day's quantum computing in the dust. And it's not free... just because Muslim authorities do not profit from Halal as aggressively as Rabbis does not mean it's not a business. It just mean Muslims are no match for Jews when it comes to commerce... Money $$$.

I say you haven't been eating halal all your life... And that Allah will not give credit for those observing PARTIAL halal like what Muslims have been doing since the inception of Islam.

Abstinence from consuming pork alone does not make one Halal because there is no such thing PARTIAL Halal.... Religion is either Black or white, there is no grey area. Having said that, I urge all good Muslims to ditch Halal and live like a true Children of Allah.

Now go sample some yummilicious bacon, chow down a Red Lobster, and gobble up a Peking duck, (etc... millions more here).

After all, PORK IS GOOD FOR YOU ( so is seafood)

Pork is a rich source of certain vitamins and minerals your body needs to function, like iron and zinc. It's also an excellent source of high-quality protein. Minimally processed, lean, fully-cooked pork eaten in moderation can provide certain benefits when added to your diet. https://www.webmd.com/diet/pork-good-for-you#:\~:text=Pork%20is%20a%20rich%20source,when%20added%20to%20your%20diet.

The teachings are ingrained from birth. They sing songs in primary from as young as age 3-4  like ""Follow the Prohet, Don't Go Astray,"" and are taught that when they turn 8 years old they are going to make ""the choice"" to be baptized. NO 8 YEAR OLD CHILD CAN COMPREHEND WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DOING WHEN THEY ARE BEING BAPTIZED/JOINING A RELIGION. They have been told by their parents, their leaders, literally everyone they know, for as long as they have been alive, without being able to see other perspectives, that it's the most important decision they can make, and that they can't go to heaven without it.  And the teaching continues about going to the temple, paying tithing, following commandments, etc. So no, I do not buy for a second that most members are following this church willfully, because they have been brainwashed into doing so. If everyone in the church knew the full history of the church, Joseph Smith and his treasure hunting, the racism, the polyandry, etc. the church would not be in the position that it is today.

afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

Earth is a crippled planet, ravaged by just the first half of his attack. Mars was played to shambles by Marcos and their traitorous Admiral. 


What I love about Marcos is his vision. He believes he can take his oppressed people and let them be the ones who seize humanity‚Äôs future, not have them starve in the shadows of Earth and Mars. He saw the ring as the future of all of the rest of humanity, and recognized that he wanted to claim it exclusively for the Belters. He isn‚Äôt wrong at all - and if he wins (which so far it seems he has) than history will remember him as a great leader and righteous savior of the Belt, ushering in the true space-age of humanity. But just because he isn‚Äôt wrong, and has great vision, doesn‚Äôt make him an absolute psycho who tried to extinguish a whole planet of mostly poor civilians.",,

Then you have a spread. 

Then tomorrow BUY back the 408c and SELL the 407c which will close the the spread. And you will get more money tomorrow.

And people are free to read whatever book they want. It's not like there's a restricted section of the Hogwarts Library somewhere in the basement of the church head quarters. 

And the whole concept of faith is you could spend your entire life trying to prove something right or wrong, but at the end of the day there are infinite questions that can be asked about anything. It will never stop if that is your metric. Lots of those questions are important, and lots are simply moot. If you genuinely believe there is any god out there, and you pray and decide the church is real, then you figure out the rest as you go. It's not for your to decide for other people what they believe no matter how frustrating that might be. 

And again, you attempt to declare how other people should spend their money while having zero idea of why they opted to maintain a reserve fund in the first place. It really is presumptuous. 

And how did they amass wealth by deceiving people? I see that you say that, but not how you show that's the case. And while the church is not political it reserves the right to weigh in on social issues that have consequence for society as a whole. Don't worry I'm well aware of all of that, I was in cali when prop 8 was going on. 

And as in all things, in the church people can choose to pay tithing or they can choose not to. Don't you remember those talks that said ""there are generally three reasons why people follow the commandments. 1. a fear of punishment, 2. a desire for the reward, 3. a genuine love of god and desire to please him."" Whether or not your parents ascribe to #1, you definitely project that that is their motivation. It's effective at producing a doom and gloom argument, but for most people they really don't see it that way. At the very least, that is not the end goal. 

And again you acknowledge that the church helps people, and it really does, and then immediately go back to saying it doesnt help actual people. The purpose of the church is to share the gospel to non-believers and believers and to enrich the learning and experience of members. Donating to food banks (which there are plenty of btw) is not the only way that's done. It also requires church programs and meeting houses and seminary and institute etc etc etc. All of these fulfill the genuine purpose of religion, which is to bring people to God, and yet, because you dont see them dump their entire surplus into one lump sum of humanitarian aid, they're a sham religion? The church is not a soup kitchen. It is a church. First and foremost it is to foster, teach and enrich lives with the gospel. It does a really good job at that. It also does a really good job coordinating relief all around the world. it ALSO does a great job teaching people to sacrifice by encouraging them to donate to wellfare funds, tithing, fast offerings etc. and yes, even missioonary service. Why? because the church is to bring people closer to god and as part of their theology, that means learning to be like him. So encouraging people to learn how to think about other people and donate does NOT mean that they are hoarding money and not spending their own, it's teaching people who to contribute to a bigger whole. What would be the purpose of a church that never asks anything of its members? What lesson would be taught? That someone else will do it for you? That you don't personally have to sacrifice? Honestly, THAT would be a sham religion.",,

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

1D Timeframe

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

* 410 really needs to hold for bulls. 
* We could see a battle at 410 as pointed out  at around 4/13
* If 410 fails look for 407.70 - 406.65 - 405 - 404.02
* Major support at 400. 
* Best case for bears is that we gap down below 410 and test for new resistance in the AM.

I would like you all to understand, however, that buying call options on the Teucrium Corn fund that tracks a mix of Corn futures could lead to a profitable trade. It is an accessible and liquid way to trade the price of corn. Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 
3.WHO is the top exporter?
The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?
China is the top importer by far (Mexico was for years until this year and commitments for next year)
5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let‚Äôs face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

The only way to stop these types of organized and unwarranted short attacks is to punish the perpetrators financially, again and again. Then, and only then, will you have a free and fair market for all.

$GME is the perfect example of how individual investors discussing the value of a company and deciding they like the stock enough to buy shares and options, can have a profound and unintended effect.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

***Positions -***

This is just one of the institutions that does this, and image how much they pay for all these bad reports against companies? Now CLOV is under investigation based on short reports....but when will they start investigating these manipulations? Rich will always get richer huh?

[Look at BOA Downgrade after Shorting CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/l72cuif6j3071.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=377602386d00b3bd63e787d2bb3bd8ea93d58698)

[BOA is there huh?  Citadel too? WOW. What a coincidence. What a surprise after Hindenburg's report. ](https://preview.redd.it/2sccbu1jk3071.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=62622eee1cb5100dc6f30dd6b7aa408f812055a7)

&#x200B;

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything.

[Hindenburg and they CITADEL TIES...](https://preview.redd.it/u62fbrz3k3071.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e4b188e2fcadc840acd6a28697c1258c3210c8d)

&#x200B;

Anyways, unfortunately, we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week, but we should still be BULLISH in CLOV even after all this manipulation. May 21 calls had high volume, but MM's want to make their money, and they will never allow for a run.

Since Mar 29 recent low for silver around $23.80 to recent high $28.80....  that $5 move equated to a 150% Gain/Return on futures contracts if entered at low and exited at high.  Futures have a Preferred Taxation of 60% Long/ 40% Short Term meaning Reduced Tax Liability.  Due Diligence to enter and exit cycles will equate to a Huge Gain using Futures which run from Sunday 5 Pm until Friday 5 Pm continuously except for a 1 hour break each day from 4 to 5 pm CST.    Hope that brings some attention for unknowing.  HOWEVER... WARNING.... BE AWARE OF CONTRACT ROLLOVER DATES meaning Expiration of current futures contract which could put you in a REAL HURTBAG.....   Again.. Hope this was Helpful.    Also use Copper Futures as a indicator of market Overbought or Oversold status....,,

No, because the rumor was there was going to be millions of cases and shutdowns.

Lowes just had their Q1 earnings right?  Well guess what, the Revenue was only  26.7% above Q1 2020 revenue but the stock is 52% above where it was pre-pandemic.

Eviction flood may be coming, but I don't think thats why lumber is falling, and I think it has further to go unless some sudden spike in home building (which it is summertime and certain states REALLY NEED it, like Cali).

TL;DR. Lumber is falling, needs to fall more. Not directly tied to potential eviction crisis I think though. Maybe the ridiculous costs could hold a little bit longer if investors weren't potentially holding cash for foreclosures but lumber price is absolutely insane, not even moderately insane.",,

Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns.

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c.",ng50po,GLD and GOLD. Useless crap but it's all about the narrative.

My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/gvhxo3dnl1071.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=546d9684c02c4da0a25f4887c727d8c893c3224b

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

8869,,2021-05-19 15:44:46,t3_ng99i7,,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

***Positions -***

This is just one of the institutions that does this, and image how much they pay for all these bad reports against companies? Now CLOV is under investigation based on short reports....but when will they start investigating these manipulations? Rich will always get richer huh?

[BOA is there huh?  Citadel too? WOW. What a coincidence. What a surprise after Hindenburg's report. ](https://preview.redd.it/2sccbu1jk3071.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=62622eee1cb5100dc6f30dd6b7aa408f812055a7)

&#x200B;

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything. 

&#x200B;

[Hindenburg and they CITADEL TIES...](https://preview.redd.it/u62fbrz3k3071.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e4b188e2fcadc840acd6a28697c1258c3210c8d)

&#x200B;

Anyways, unfortunately, we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week, but we should still be BULLISH in CLOV even after all this manipulation. May 21 calls had high volume, but MM's want to make their money, and they will never allow for a run.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

It goes with that whole ""milk before meat"" thing. Somethings just don't make sense without context and some things just never make sense even with context. Some people feel like kids need more context before tackling seemingly bizarre topics. But overtime yea, things make sense. Polygamy is not a foreign concept among righteous people in the bible. But I'm not here to argue doctrines and in this whole exchange I have not been defending the church itself. You have made several fallacious and unfounded accusations regarding the church and all I have done is to point out the fallacy and clarify the premises in question. I have not made a case on behalf of the church beyond that, which is why I really have zero interest in defending the other issues you brought up about treasure hunting. While your take on those events may differ than mine, you've stated no fallacy and so there's no reason for me to speak up.   


And you are too quick to assume that people do not investigate every in and out before deciding what to believe. I'm scientist by trade and grew up in a family that was split down the middle, half liking the church and half despising it and trying everything they could to get me to ""see"" the truth. But every argument was laced with fallacy. No matter how brilliant they or you all imagined themselves to be, fallacy is never an adequate substitute for reality.

AMC ran with GME the first time and now GME is running with AMC now. I don't see this getting above 20 not matter how much ""data"" there is to support it. But, I was surprised it ran this high though so take that for what it is worth.

There are soooo many people involved in this movement that have zero knowledge about the stock market. Those will be shaken out by this weekend if AMC stays around $12. The ride ends before it even starts.

I wish we had someone with actual knowledge that could explain what is happening with the hedge funds. They don't have the same brokers/rules as retail. Are they really paying these prices? Do they really have a chance to get margin called? All points I would like to see instead we get ""MOON!!!""",,

I think this, Elon said that BTC affect the environment so it doesn‚Äôt make sense have a friendly environment company and have BTC. So ETH produce less carbon emissions but they are working on ETH 2.0 that will not affect the environment because individuals like us will have control over transactions ( thats the plan) but they have to let 33 ETH and have a good history working with ETH so people can trust and also they will receive payment. So there will be just few computers per individual that will reduce carbon emission significantly and also ETH structure is far away better than BTC, so i think Elon will buy and use ETH as a payment method but we have to wait to the ETH update.",,
