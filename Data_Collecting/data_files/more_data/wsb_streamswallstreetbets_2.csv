If you are interested in silver the metal, the COMMODITY, do your DD and find out Who To Avoid.. because they are feeding you atrocious crap and sucking your sweet innocent blood (you poor saps) 

If you is a **survivalist** you don't give a DAMN how much you pay for your silver cause fiat wont be worth SQAT when the collapse of civilization comes and friend eats friend, so go a head pay with your mortgage, your bones and your granny's shrunken head if you want to.

BUT - If you want a fair commodity price because you think it will rise in value and the USA trade system will CONTINUE - then STEP BACK, look around, consider the alternatives.   
Figure if you're paying more than it's worth now, or more than its likely to be worth anytime soon.

It might be a good investment, but NOT from 9 out of 10 of the cheapskate ripoff FOMO glossy ads I been seeing. Bet there's a couple of those tricksters slipped in WSB from time to time even.

BYND has a short interest of 25% and is just starting to be squeezed with an analyst upgrade to overweight and a price target of $190 and it closed up almost 3% at $145 on friday whereas AMC closed down 1.5%. BYND is the next great stock to be squeezed with a legitimate price target of $190 and with deals with yum china and mcdonald. AMC is just trading among it's own traders and may sell another 500 million shares next week to raise badly needed capital and has a 1 penny price target.. I advise taking profit in AMC after of 126% gain last week and put it into BYND (Beyond meat).**,nnpd7e,BYND still has shorts to be squeezed and was up almost 3% on Friday unlike AMC which was down more than 1.5%

251,gzvlna6,2021-05-29 15:10:14,t1_gzvlna6,t1_gzvhi9y,wallstreetbets,"I have made money by owning options that did not change much in price but the volatility went up and lost a lot of money the same way. I also had options where the stock went up every day but the profits were eaten up by Theta. If you buy options it is so very important that you know the greeks as you will lose all your money if you don't pay attention to the greeks. 

Here is a broken-down list of the greeks and I wrote next to each greek how I remember them quickly.  Delta, Theta, and Vega have the most impact.

Delta - (Days left + change in the value of your underlying stock combined) Delta is the amount the option goes up or down as the price goes up or down of the stock.  
The rule of thumb is an at-the-money option has a delta of 0.50. That means if the stock goes up by $1, the option goes up by 50cents when the option is at the money (meaning your option is the same as the current stock value) It is very important to understand delta is not fixed. It is a function of the underlying stock price and the time remaining until expiration. As an option moves further into-the-money and time decays, the delta increases at an accelerated rate. Conversely, as an option moves further out-of-the money and has more time remaining, delta decreases at a slower rate. So on a Friday shortly before 4:00PM an option at or in the money will move up much quicker almost double than an option at the same strike price that is 4 months out.  
Theta- (Time - This is the cost per day for owning the option/fixed amount)  
is the expected percentage change in an option's price for a one-unit change in time. Options are decaying assets in that their value decreases as time passes. Theta, or time decay, is not influenced by any of the other variables but is defined on a slope. That is, it accelerates as expiration approaches.  
Vega - Volatility  
 is the expected change in an option's value for a one-unit move in implied volatility. Again, the strict formula is defined as a 1% move, but for practical purposes, it will typically be expressed in dollars per one-point move. For example, if a call currently implied volatility of 25% and a vega of 0.30. If implied, volatility increased to 26% the value of the call would increase from 30c to $10.30, even if the underlying share price didn‚Äôt change.  
Gamma is the rate of change in an option's delta for every one-unit change in the price of the underlying. As such, it is a derivative of a derivative (a second derivative) and moves in minuscule increments.  
Rho is the expected change in an option's price for every one-unit change in interest rates. With rates near zero and not going much higher for the foreseeable future, this will not have much of an impact on options pricing.ng.g..

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it. Don't forget to hold!",nnpn9z,AMC & GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze

Amazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.

&#x200B;

Here's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store)

[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362)

&#x200B;

**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**

Due to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier

&#x200B;

Here's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): 

Chief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke 

Chief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens

Chief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis

&#x200B;

[https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3)

&#x200B;

**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**

Many people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails

How does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number

&#x200B;

**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**

Between developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.

&#x200B;

**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**

Being able to shift the news narrative from ""Amazon kills unionization attempts"" to ""Amazon saves \~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop"" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal

&#x200B;

Just a couple recent articles about Amazon:

Frontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/19/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/19/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat)

&#x200B;

A NYT article titled ""How Amazon Crushes Unions""

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html)

&#x200B;

**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**

Now that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.

Elon & Jeff have been rivals for years:

[https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7)

Plus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!

&#x200B;

**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P/E Ratio**

Buying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P/E ratio). As of 5/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5/28

Having a P/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.",nnprt0,Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models.

I saw that these shares were worth $120 a few months ago and researched why recebtly, reading all the drama about it on the two main g m e threads has been super weird and entertaining.

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

But separate from this we‚Äôve had a lot of complaints and reports how it‚Äôs all the same each day with ‚Äúwar‚Äù memes and ‚Äúmontage‚Äù clips.
