Lloyd’s Bank (American ADR - LYG) released the following statement in their 2021 Shareholder Event call last week regarding the opportunity to pay an additional dividend in 2021 beyond the maximum allowable set by the UK government in response to the Covid crisis. 

“Regarding our dividend. Last year, following a request to all banks by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Group suspended dividends on ordinary shares and cancelled the final dividend for 2019. These decisions were not taken lightly and I'm sure will have come as a disappointment to you, our shareholders.

However, our capital position has remained strong as a result and, following the PRA announcement in December, the Board was therefore able to recommend a total ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share - the maximum allowable within the PRA guidelines.

We recognise the importance of the dividend to many of our shareholders. The PRA has said that they will consider their guidance on 2021 dividends before banks announce their half-year results, so the Board expects to be in a position to discuss interim dividends when it reviews the performance of the business for the first half of the year. Our position on quarterly dividends will also be confirmed at this time.

The Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, subject to regulatory guidance, the Board intends to grow the dividend from 2020, in line with the Group's progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.”

https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/LON:LLOY/Lloyds-Banking-Group/rns/975557

The Prudential Regulation Authority will release an update to their guidance requiring UK banks to scrap dividends throughout 2020 and 4Q 2019 sometime this summer. Currently a maximum allowable dividend of 0.47p is set for 2021. However the PRA is expected to either increase this amount or allow banks to reinstate unrestricted dividends. Although unrestricted dividends will most likely occur in 2022, the opportunity for additional dividends in 2021 and a large increase in yield beginning in 2022 could be a catalyst for LYG to cross the $3 threshold and touch $4 around the time the updated guidance and dividend plan is released. 

Additional info from Q1 2021:

Lloyd’s CET1 ratio is 16.4% before dividends and 16.2% after, well ahead of the bank’s target of around 12.5% and regulatory requirements around 11%.

Lloyd’s released approximately $460M from their impairment reserve that was created in response to the Covid crisis. $3,740M remains in the reserve. 

Lloyd’s UK banking peers (Barclays, HSBC, NatWest) are in similar positions.",nmbc27,LYG - Additional Dividend Opportunity in 2021.

I see a huge emphasis being put on energy storage. There are countries that are regularly exceeding their energy demand using renewables but as soon as the sun sets or the wind dies down, they need to ramp up fossil fuel plants again. I see utilities and electrical producers investing heavily in infrastructure to store massive amounts of energy. This could be done through a variety of physical and   
 chemical methods. Additionally, we should expect to see energy prices increase as utilities and energy companies have to start sequestering carbon. My background is in atmospheric chemistry so I've been a lot more amped on the chemical energy storage but physical storage will likely scale better. 

&#x200B;

I have a lot of thoughts about hydrogen. Long story short, it needs a lot more work. On paper, hydrogen fuel cells look game changing but the real world applications are a little trickier. Infrastructure issues behind mass deployment of hydrogen is an issue (see: The Hindenberg) as well as long term durability of fuel cells. Additionally, the most efficient way to get H2 gas is to ""crack"" methane (CH4) or other hydrocarbons. This means there will still be a demand for natural gas extraction (which is very detrimental to our climate and local air quality) in order to power our hydrogen fuel cells. I really, really want to believe in hydrogen but I don't see it beating electric and alternative fueled vehicles in the next decade. Those two sectors have their own set of hurdles to surmount but it'll be a lot easier than hydrogen.

&#x200B;

The two aspects of renewable energy that have gotten me really excited recently are biochemical production of natural gas (e.g. renewable natural gas) and plasma gasification. Using microbes to produce natural gas not only gives us useable natural gas to power infrastructure but it also serves as a method of carbon sequestration. Plasma gasification is using plasma to heat materials so that they release all combustible gases and produce solid carbon and trace metals (which can be disposed of).

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

I have personally purchased GE stock as I believe it is headed for long term growth. 

20 Year and 5 year Charts for GE shows the stock having performed a “double bottom.” 

On both charts, the 50 MA has bottomed and is beginning to retrace upward. It will soon perform a golden cross with the 200 MA, a very strong sign of growth. 

Both charts show MACD significantly above the line. 

GE has broken a previous resistance level of $13; the next appears to be $15; the next levels would be 17.50, 20, and 22.50. 

Based on these signals, I purchased, looking for the stock to break through the $15 resistance level soon. 

Could you please share your thoughts? I would appreciate contrarian and supporting opinions with reasoning.

But investing per 100$ increments is more work than its worth. If i were you id keep money in my bank account until i have 2-3 month worth of emergency fund. Once you have achieved that, then start putting money into investing. Everytime you hit around 1000-2000$ then invest (Buy stocks, ETF, whatever). I always try to invest in brackets between 1000$ and 2000$. When a really good deal shows up (lets say a -5% in the SPY) then ill spend my invest money even if its 1000 or lower).   


And the reason why I ''force'' myself to invest once it reaches 2000 is that if you wait to long for a deal/dip, then you might miss the boat. This strategy has been doing well for me.  


TLDR:  
1. Always have a buffer for emergency that you aren't putting in the market.   
2. Buy within a min/max bracket so that you can more reactively take advantage of dips, while also making sure you don't waste to much time waiting for dips that might not occur.",,

IOS has only about 1.2% of the malware, Android is around 25% and Windows is up around 35%. So bottomline is Apple is going to stand firm and likely defeat Epic.

Investing in a broad index ETF such as SPY guarantees you are the owner of every company that goes bankrupt.  Buying a bunch of companies will probably result in some 10, 20, 30-bagggers. You will also have some losers, but you can off-set those with gains in taxable accounts.  
The maximum you can lose on a $1,000 investment is $1,000 but the maximum you can gain is technically infinity. More realistically, up to 10-20x -- which means you would need 10-20 other stocks to go banko just to break even (and it's not too likely anybody will have that many companies go to $0). 
Back in the .com boom, anybody that bought a bunch of tech companies would've had some bankruptcies like Etoys, Pets.com, etc. But they would've also had insane gains in Amazon, Apple, Priceline, etc -- especially if they're in it for the long term. Based on that experience, I'm taking the same approach to EV stocks and it had turned out very well for me. And with a taxable account, a 100% loss on a stock is more like a 70-75% loss, as you can net that loss against your other gains, which means you'll be writing Uncle Sam a smaller check because of your losses.
I don't think there is anything as too many stocks; over the course of many years, having a vested interest in many companies will allow you to see the 'personalities' of the stocks over time, which will allow you to gain trust in certain ones. Sure, you can do your DD prior to making an investment, but seeing 1st hand how some weather business cycles, recessions, pandemics, etc. will build your trust in management over time. You may need to wait years for another good entry point but when you get it, you can confidently jump in with both feet and make some huge gains.  
TL;DR - IMO, at least keep a passive eye on your positions and no amount is too many.",,

If it was on a model that the dealer was willing to negotiate to invoice with no discount, than with the discount they’d likely go below invoice since they would now have more money from Ford to work with.

FB - I think it is the most undervalued FAANG+M stock as of now. Additionally, compared to AAPL, MSFT, GOOG - it is much less mature and has lot more room for growth. I think the data limitations posed by AAPL will not have the major effect that some think.

I’m a huge fan of SpaceX and watch every Starship test. Heck, I’ve been thinking about visiting Boca Chica to scope out land for sale. I wish I could own some SpaceX, but I can’t.

I started looking for companies that can benefit from Starlink. I checked ocean shipping. Nope. I didn’t immediately find anything in rail. I haven’t checked highway shipping, yet. But when it came to air, I had some luck.

My criteria were simple. I needed to find a company that did could greatly benefit from satellite broadband by integrating it into their current model. They should not have fixed space assets that compete directly with SpaceX and Starlink. They also need to have a means to manage the shortcomings of Starlink.

Speaking of Starlink shortcomings, population density seems to be the biggest problem. Starlink is crap in cities. For aviation, this means Starlink will be garbage when near an airport: no sat broadband when boarding and landing or flying over a city.

This brings us to $GOGO. They sold off their commercial airline support last December, so now they focus on the private business market. They provide entertainment and data systems for private jets. Like the one the hedgies and your wife’s boyfriend fly in. These aren’t the people that are going to install their own Starlink that came in the mail. Instead, they will expect the folks that manage their system to do it. And that is $GOGO.

$GOGO currently mainly uses 4G cell connections. They have contracts across North America. They recently signed deals for 5G, too. So far as I know, $GOGO isn’t even thinking about Starlink at this point. I may have to write them a letter. But the cell connection is great, too. Remember how Starlink won’t work at the airports? That’s not a problem for $GOGO.

Whether $GOGO knows it or not, they will soon have much faster and cheaper data to offer their rich clients. This is why I think $GOGO is a clear Starlink play. But I’m an ape that lost my ass on $PLTR calls, and this isn’t financial advice.

Net revenue for this company grew to $261 million in 2020 from $110.5 million in 2019. The company grew from $17.6 million in 2017, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 146%. 

Valuation of $4.6 billion. The IPO priced at $22 a share, which was above the expected range of $16 and $19 a share. It soared out the gate at 36%, reaching a peak of  ~$30.70, currently trading around $29.50.

Did not know this company went IPO today until I got an email from them on their server list. As a healthcare worker and FIGS fanatic I’m excited about this but unsure about the valuation. I do believe they’re a great company and they have a crazy fanbase, almost cult like. Their scrubs are pricey but they have loyal fans and we’ve seen companies with super loyal fans obviously do really well.

471,gzo48pt,2021-05-27 18:58:27,t1_gzo48pt,t1_gzndzlz,stocks,"platform-wise, yes there is definitely some growing to do for CBS and they joined the game waaay too late. Amazon has rights to NFL's thursday night football currently, but they were not actively seeking a partnership with the NFL. the way i saw this deal, the NFL set a price point that regular tv networks deemed too high purposely because they knew Amazon has the capital and wants to get their skin in the game or test the waters at least in addition to their marketing power.

one of the few leverages the traditional TV networks have are local team broadcasts. their infrastructure is already in place for this. this is where a lot of other streaming services lack. all the major sports networks that big streamers usually carry (NFL TV, NBA TV, MLB TV) blackout local games. while things like the super bowl are important to viewership, that is just icing on the cake to me. local viewership is just as important, especially when generational talent rolls around, for that consistent income. athletes nowadays are human billboards. coupled with talks that college athletes will be able to be paid/endorsed heating up. Patrick Mahomes, the next football prodigy in many people's eyes, has singlehandedly increased viewership/interest by leaps and bounds. traditional tv networks are able to show these guys more regularly with local viewership + just being able to show more national games in general rather than the once a week 1 match up thursday night football. CBS in particular also has a long list of sportscasters that have been around for decades and they can sway viewership also, albeit on a much smaller scale. your average sports fan is going to pick the service where we can see our teams more often rather than just the ""big games"". these people are loyal and will go where ever their team goes. 

this is territory where it gets tricky for big streamers because of the (for lack of a better term) ""cyclical"" nature of sports, both season and draw appeal of the athletes. unless big streamers acquired a traditional tv network or became a network themselves, they would likely have to work something out with their competitors. it'd be too much of a risk to ride only on the big games because the outcome of a sporting event can tank viewership/ratings in the blink of an eye as what it was with the most recent super bowl. i wouldn't put it passed a company like amazon to do this with the way they've been going, but it seems like a hill that may be too difficult to climb.",,

I don't work for this company any longer, but I was able to retain about 51,000 of the stocks that were issued when I left the company last fall. 

Today when I went to move the stocks from the transfer agent into a brokerage, the transfer agent gave me an account statement showing that the number changed in February. Can anyone help me understand *why?* Is there anything I can do about this?

How is it legal for them to issue shares and then remove it from the account without my permission?

We can do that fine with a quantum safe algo, of which, there are plenty and a quantum computer will absolutely suck at those for a long time.

Quantum computing has potential, that is true. But the number of application is overblown. It will be critical to some applications, but useless for most. Its like all the idiots who actually thing blockchain is new and magical. It isn't. Quantum will be able to solve things that numerically werent possible before due to data size. But not everything needs that much data solved simultaneously. In fact, very few things need that though those few can be very interesting.

One thing that might come from quantum is the ability to communicate over huge distances at, possibly, speeds faster than light. Think internet without any distance latency. This would open up the possibility of deep space travel. Basically you can watch the latest flicks (porn) from billions of miles away...

Another might be muti dimensional data storage. In theory, if we can stabilize a quantum state for data storage, a quantum storage device can have storage density unlike anything we have now. It would be revolutionary. Think of a box where you can store a message inside. It can be empty or it can have a letter. Now think instead of putting the letter inside, what if you pin the letter to the outsides of the box on one of the 6 surfaces? Since it has 6 sides, you can potentially store 6 messages on the surfaces and all you need to do is say which side of the box to look at to find your letter. Its the same box, but instead of 1 letter you now have 6. Quantum would be able to have a lot more than 6 sides. It will just depend on how well we can devise a way to read it.",,

&#x200B;

Its latest results I thought were pretty robust considering it had to deal with Covid / reduced demand, Texan weather and not great commodity prices. These are a pretty rare mix of events that is going to cause a strain, and yet they weathered well. 

&#x200B;

They are an extremely well diversified mid-stream company. They have many more miles of gas than oil, have 10s of thousands of miles in total, significant storage, multiple refining locations and also ports. 

&#x200B;

It is now increasingly hard to build even a single pipeline, can you imagine trying to get sign-off for 50000 miles of pipeline? Political winds have given large pipeline companies a significant barrier to entry and competition. 

&#x200B;

Although it's easy to say that political winds and social pressures are moving away from fossil fuels, I'd make a couple of rebuttals. Firstly, not all fossil fuels are equal, going from coal > oil > gas, in that order. Coal exists and is being actively phased out by most of the Western world,, but oil and gas still have decades to run. The data I've seen suggests that although oil falls as a % of total energy by 2050, due to demand from developing world, actually increases in barrels. A lot of people don't realise but less than half of oil goes toward vehicles, and you would be astonished to know what it's used in. Gas will have an even longer shelf-life as the cleanest of the fossil fuels. 

&#x200B;

For me, as a Brit, the fact its an MLP is actually a benefit. Usually I get charged a 15% withholding tax on my American dividends, but as MLPs pay distributions, I am not charged for this. My brokerage takes care of the K-1 paperwork that I understand is a bit of a hassle, but I never see it. A near 8% yield on an American stock is extremely rare, and only my UK miners exceed that (helped as I also get no divi tax on them either as I keep it in an ISA, similar but much better than your IRAs)

749,,2021-05-27 20:15:58,t3_nmgie6,,stocks," WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his fiscal year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC.

The new spending would be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030.

Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will bring the president’s total budget request for next year to $6 trillion, the source said.

Biden’s budget also projects that inflation will reach no more than 2.3% annually over the next 10 years, reflecting the administration’s belief that concerns among some economists about runaway inflation are overblown.

Like in all presidential budgets, the vast majority of the money in Biden’s 2022 budget request will be spent on programs that the federal government is obligated to fund, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Beyond those, Biden has requested $1.5 trillion in discretionary funds, half of which is slated for defense.

The president’s new spending, the $5 trillion over 10 years, is intended to fund the twin pillars of his sweeping domestic agenda: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan.

The former would make major investments in both traditional infrastructure and in green technology, which Biden argues is crucial to making America competitive in the global economy. It would also shore up the U.S. electrical grid, expand broadband access and bolster care for the elderly and disabled.

This second piece contains additional funding for two years of free universal pre-K and two years of free community college. It also funds heavily subsidized child care for middle-class families, federal paid family leave and expanded child tax credits.

The combined cost of these two programs is $4.1 trillion over the next decade and would be paid for primarily through higher taxes on corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers.

The White House is currently negotiating with Senate Republicans on a potential bipartisan infrastructure deal, but this negotiation is separate from the FY 2022 budget request.

Presidential budgets are typically one part plan and one part wish list, designed to illustrate the president’s policy priorities as much as they are to inform congressional appropriators.

Presidential budget requests are also dependent upon Congress to pass them. But with Democrats in control of both chambers this year, Biden has a far better chance of seeing his budget enacted into law than most of his recent predecessors.

In former President Barack Obama’s final year in office in 2016, Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate disregarded his budget altogether.

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

**Highlights** 

* Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets. Stock reacted positively to the news. 
* Durable goods orders, or orders for manufactured goods intended to last at least three years, unexpectedly declined in April, ending an 11-month streak of increases, the Commerce Department said Thursday, an encouraging sign. 
* “Meme stocks” are on the move again, with AMC gapping up 40% on the day. Gamestop (GME) and AMC have both been on monster runs this week.
* Paytm, India’s largest digital payment platform, is reportedly aiming to go public later this year with a valuation of $25-$30 billion.
* Shares of Ford (F) have been on fire since the company announced it was making a big investment to manufacture EVs and recently unveiled the all-electric Ford F-150 pickup, one of the company’s most popular models. \\
* Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are all involved in a bidding process to provide cloud services to Boeing, according to multiple reports. 
* Disney’s (DIS) California-based parks will welcome non-California natives starting June 15.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Applied Materials (AMAT) with three target raises. Stock currently around $137

 Is average cost important?
 Because it seems that this strategy increases the average cost of my stocks every time I sell and buy, and it also gives me less profit every time too.

1. When inflation happens, interest rates rise. Rising interest rates are bad for precious metals because investors flock to assets with yields.

2. Gold prices have already increased in anticipation of inflation. Gold prices are already up about 20% since the start of the pandemic. Much of the returns from precious metals are driven by changing investor sentiment rather than tracking inflation. Declining interest rates cause inflation fears, which drive up prices before inflation even happens. By the time inflation happens and rates go up, gold prices decline. Just look at what happened to gold/silver prices after the GFC. Hit an ATH of about $183 in 2011 due to inflation panic, then crashed down to just over $100 in 2015, and never fully recovered until last summer when money printing fears resurfaced.",,

837,,2021-05-27 20:36:42,t3_nmgze6,,stocks,"On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho.

The downside to TIPS is you won't earn any real return on them, they will only maintain capital. After taxes on interest, they may actually produce negative real returns. But that's sort of a price to pay for certainty.

The sunroof in the F250 has been replaced twice now.

The fuel tank bits came screwed up and caused the gas gauge to read incorrectly.

The replaced fuel tank pumps would later go on to fail.  Causing my dealer to keep the truck for over a month.  Thank god for the extended warranty which covered a rental vehicle during that time (even though this occurred under the factory warranty).

I did score a 40k extended service policy out of the deal.  Which covers all consumables - except fuel.  So that's pretty cool.

If you left the key fob in your pocket and you hit it wrong, the tailgate would deploy at high way speeds.  The first time that happened, it was mildly amusing and all James Bondy-ie.  Not so much afterwards.  Thankfully a quick fix there with a firmware update.

Aside from that, it at least hasn't left me stranded.  It was able to limp home with the failed fuel pumps.

My F150 - while old, doesn't have that many miles on it.  About 138k.

Many many years ago, it had relays fail that stranded me.  The intake manifold had to be replaced twice (in very, very short order).  The a/c failed - (admittedly, this one I blame this on just sheer age) in an ugly ugly way that caused the whole system to have to be replaced.

VOO
QQQ

I'm looking for another ETF that is not apart of Tech to kind of help diversify my holdings. I was wondering if 'XLC' would be a good third ETF. My plan right now is each month put X amount into a single ETF, then the next month put it into the next ETF, etc., and essentially continously put money into all three ETFs. I'm in my late 20's and my goal is to hold long term 10 - 15 years or longer. 


If anyone has suggestions on other ETFs, I would greatly appreciate it as I'm trying to find the right ETFs to get into and hopefully grow over time.

Thank you in advance!",nmhqwl,What 3 ETFs are good to diversify with and buy into?
