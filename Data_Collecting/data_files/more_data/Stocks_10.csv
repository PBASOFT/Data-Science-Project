19,gytfqd4,2021-05-20 13:00:34,t1_gytfqd4,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"The bottom line is this: in no other time in human history has the average man had such access to his money. He can move everything he owns at the push of a button. Previously there was a broker who had to input the order and, while I am NOT supporting brokers, they did have a stabilizing effect on the market.

""Are you sure you want to do this.. here's why I think it's a bad idea"" etc.

Now, the average man works. A lot. He wants a piece of the pie but he's working so much (or he's just lazy) he refuses or doesn't have time to actually learn why things have value. The ""fundamentals"". So, what does this leave him to make his decisions with?

Emotion (aka ""marketing""). He has nothing else to base his decisions on.

 Ex: I held my Bitcoin through all the movements from 2011 and through yesterday (still have them today) because I learned the tech and knew it was going somewhere. I also sold my doge the first time elon talked about it and it spiked because I also knew it was a joke and shouldn't go anywhere long term.

If you learn, you can weather the ups and downs. You know what's going on, you know why it has value, you know why you should own it. You'll hold through anything.

I tried explaining why someone on Facebook should teach their kid how to pick things based on management, fundamentals and usability and got told, literally, ""piss off boomer"" by someone else in the thread. It's an eye opener to where the market is headed.

Now, long term, like 20 years down the road, I worry this will affect the markets as the young guys who get burned now are going to be market shy later. That's money that won't flow in to the market because they'll blame the market for their losses and not themselves and their lack of knowledge. Since I'm 43 and not actually a boomer, this will affect me as well (at least I hope :) ). We'll see how this plays out I guess.",,

Secondly, brokers prioritise stop orders based on first in-first out. So, if there are 10 stop orders at the same price, the trader who placed it first will exit first. 

There are two types of stop orders- **Stop limit** and **stop market**. In the first, you set a stop loss and a limit order. So, if prices trade between the two, your order gets executed. In the second, once the stop order is triggered, your order is closed at the next possible price. There are chances that your stop limit does not execute, but stop market orders are always executed.

For example, I’ve made the conscious effort to avoid “convenience” factor like buying from AMZN and instead shopping at our local stores.  It requires a little more effort & maybe a little more $$ at risk but the payoff is much more rewarding.  In the same way, It’s convenient to put money in an etf, mutual fund or stock.  Yet the result of this is more fraud, deceit and abuse.  One issue is my wife is a financial advisor and while I earned a CFA which helps me speak to subject, she doesn’t see what I see. Perhaps I should stop playing “this game” of measuring my myself by my stock portfolio or bank account.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.  
My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.  
How to use it?  
Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.  
Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).  
Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line  
Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line  
No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line  
Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).  
You can see example entries here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/  
This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  
This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them  
This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  
If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.",,

There's no universal causal link there. 

Technically speaking equity prices are linked to current profitability and perceived future profitability (earnings growth). Inflation does not drive up earnings. It drives up Revenue and Costs. Not at the same rate, but eventually it levels out. Otherwise, we'd have infinitely profitable companies after decades of inflation....which we don't.

If management compensation is based on company share price, they can influence it by sending out a one time special dividend which might lead investors to think it’s a positive signal by mgmt, etc. 

If the company has excess cash, and has no other uses for it, then a special dividend also isn’t necessarily good or bad. Personally, I would rather companies focus more on looking for acquisitions, or re-investing into R&D or CapEx to drive growth. I also do know that it’s not realistic to always find these opportunities hence, it’s neither a good or a bad thing. 

I don’t know much about the company you mentioned, but check the financial statements of the company and see if it makes sense for them to be issuing this one time dividend. If it doesn’t, it is definitely a red flag on management. Capital allocation is extremely important for a company to be successful in the long term.",,

As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking.",nh2yi0,SQM and lithium demand

Chuck Hull, 3D System’s former president, and CTO invented stereolithography and received a patent for it in 1986.

Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminded plaintiffs on May 17, 2021, that the closing date to file a lead plaintiff petition in the class action brought on behalf of investors who bought or otherwise acquired 3D Systems Corporation shares between May 6, 2020, and March 1, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”) was approaching on June 8, 2021

Defendants made knowingly inaccurate and/or misleading claims during the Class Period, according to the lawsuit, and refused to reveal significant adverse information regarding 3D Systems’ industry, activities, and prospects. Defendants specifically refused to inform investors that:

3D Systems violated adequate internal controls on financial reporting.
As a result, Defendants’ claims about 3D Systems, activities, and prospects were materially inaccurate and deceptive and/or lacked a fair basis at all applicable times.

Through their first years of production, they had a take or pay agreement with Glencore, a pretty massive mining conglomerate that took a healthy cut of their sales. (New miners make these agreements before they open because it makes it possible to achieve reasonable financing.) That expired after Q2 last year I think, so the direct effect of that should be almost done with their results, trailing PE-wise--except that it meant they had to start their own proprietary sales team to move the product themselves, and that they had to build up an inventory of product in the markets they sell to, which took some months. They figure to make a higher profit this way in the long run, but it has impacted the past year. 

Also, in Q1 this year they upgraded some of their processing equipment, which should let them produce more of their end product (V2O5) every quarter, but they had to stop production for a few weeks to do it.

Price should also be high relative to past 12 earnings because the price of the product is up relative to these past four quarters, with V2O5 now around $8/lb vs. around $5/lb over 2020. (In general, mining stocks are interestingly leveraged to the underlying product... Largo makes V2O5 for like $3/lb, so at $5/lb they make $2. At $8/lb they make $5... 150% increase in the profits because of a 60% increase in the underlying price.)

Resistance is usually the level holding a stock down, so if a stock starts to rise, you can see it fall again because it's not breaking the resistance level.

And take a look at that last paragraph below. They spent over $150M just in advisory fees in 3 years to end up where they were to begin with but with more debt.  “After all of that deal-making, ATT is sitting on more than $170 billion in debt. As part of the deal with Discovery, ATT will get $43 billion to help reduce its debt load. (The spun-off media business will begin its independent life with $58 billion in debt.)”

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/ATT-WarnerMedia-Discovery.html?referringSource=articleShare


The DealBook newsletter explains how ATT got here, in three key deals:

1..A $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile. After regulatory pushback, in 2011 ATT walked away from an effort to become the country’s largest wireless company. T-Mobile paired up instead with Sprint, and the two went on to buy huge amounts of spectrum in the high-stakes battle for 5G, leaving ATT behind as it lobbies regulators to step in. The failed deal hit ATT with a $3 billion dollar breakup fee, at the time the largest ever.

2.  The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, ATT bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and ATT unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost ATT about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.

3.  The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Mr. Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, ATT is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. ATT paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart.",nfl6c8,Details behind AT&T’s debt (cross posted)
