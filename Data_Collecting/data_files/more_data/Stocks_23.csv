The way tax implications and effort/reward changes drastically depending on how much money you have to where % gains and loss DOES matter pretty significantly

For instance if you have 100k, making 1 or 2% in a few weeks with a couple hours of researching picks is a massive gain, and still within reasonable tax implications. If you make 1% on 100 bucks for that same effort you aren't going to be taxed but you literally made 1 dollar for a few hours of work. Absolute waste of time. On the flip side if you have a million bucks, a small % loss is a ton of money, and not simply something you can easily get back with a day job. Small gains also carry with them significant tax implications at higher brackets, to where trading can really screw you and not be worth the effort compared to investing.",,

Most brokers aren't going to directly give you this option, and will default to selling first-in, first-out, though.  Depending on your broker, you may be able to change the default and / or manually choose tax lots to sell through an advanced order page.  Some brokers may not provide many options for that in their apps and sites, and will require you to call them, but all of them will let you choose which tax lot you want to sell if you really want to as far as I'm aware.

Yes robinhood will almost certainly pull more shenanigans during the squeeze. Their paymaster is citadel after all. I feel bad for those who dont and cant move to another broker. Thousands of customers have already transferred to fidelity alone.

Not hoping there is more than enough evidence if you actually look for it. You raise a good point about the rules being changed. Recently a number of regualtory changes  have been passed by the SEC which paint a powetful picture of whats to come. Google OCC-004 and OCC- 003 , if only for curiosity  Or dont, the choice is yours. 

The SEC /DTCC are preparing for a nuclear bomb and are battening down the hatches in order to isolate the damage and reduce a wider negative market impact.

My point is that this is much bigger than you realise. This is why it is so hard for people to get onboard as the whole scenario seems improbable. I get it. Call me a flat earther etx but all the evidence points to it.

I could call you out  for selling so low but i wont. Profit is profit at the end of the day. All i will say is this is the definition of an asymmetric bet. Pick up a share just for the fun of it. You have been trading for 2 years im sure you can afford it.

79,,2021-05-24 23:38:06,t3_nkbmpp,,stocks,"Initially, I wanted to come into this post completely unbiased, I wanted to present the bull and bear case and give you a complete overview of sentiment and questioning from both camps, but I couldn’t help myself. Let me say it out loud, SPCE has an argument to make, I’m here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult. No company or stock out there is a guarantee, I am not here to sell SPCE, it is still high risk as before, but that’s the nature of space exploration isn’t it…

Critique #1 - Revenue:  The company has millions in cash, enough to continue burning for 2 years. They plan to generate income via paying customers, astronaut training, low orbit cargo/experiment carry assignments, transportation offerings, and more. If this company doesn’t see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: “SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.”

 \#Debunked:  Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk and SpaceX have touched on space tourism and presented concepts for how to use SN for high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city… 2 When will you get on a rocket heading for outer space with just a T-shirt and flip flops? When you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it’s not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let’s talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could meet its original goals, it’s now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don’t have an airport to take off from…I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems….are you noticing a pattern?….

Critique #3 - Death:  I’ve read the comments “this is a disaster waiting to happen”, “they will get canceled when thy kill somebody”….for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away… in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked. The difference with these companies and most stocks, especially tech/growth is they all make serious, serious money!

**LDI makes close to 1 billion a year, just made over 300 million. Announced a special dividend of 200 million or 62 cents a share. They announced a regular dividend per share. The market cap is slightly over 4 billion. Yes, they have a PE ratio of under 4! Cash flows to buy back shares instead of using money for dividends. They have lost over 1.2 billion in market cap since RKT report.**

**HMPT just made 149 million the past 3 months. They have lost over 500 million in market cap since RKT reported. They have not announced a dividend or anything yet. The company trades at 2.5x earnings. They make cash!**

**UWMC, did the right thing makes cash and announced a 300 million buyback. I believe they have smoked out the shorts as it dipped as low as 6.25 and has recovered nicely.**

**RKT makes roughly 8 billion a year! They are valued near 35 billion and have lost over 14 billion since earninings! They last quarter gave out over 2 billion for free via a special dividend of over 1.14 per share. They have 2 billion shares! They make over $4 per share and trade under 17!!!**

LDI trades 200,000 shares daily! The stock is under 14!! Can you imagine a 100 million buyback?? They are giving 100 million via dividend and just gave 200 million special dividend they can do it!

HMPT trades just over 100,000 shares at about 6! Even a 20 million buyback will moon the stock. They just made 149 million the last 3 months!

Good luck everyone. Happy trading!",nkc3fe,"Just a trade idea. There could be a great opportunity in the mortgage sector. RKT, HMPT, LDI UWMC. Share thoughts, PROS, CONS?"

Even if they weren't confident about their future, what other choice do they have? They could just return all the money to shareholders, but have you ever seen an organization do that?

Rebuttal #2: You are right that SpaceX is in a different market. They can go orbital, which is cooler and lasts longer than 5 minutes -- but currently costs 10s of millions per seat. They will need starship to bring that down but if they can -- at similar prices, SPCE has no way of competing against that.

BO is on the trajectory of doing orbital, but they currently have a comparable suborbital experience to SPCE and it's going to happen roughly at the same time (first paying customer in the summer). The existence of this will reduce SPCEs margins and market share.

I'm not quite sure there will be enough people interested in a mid-6 digit cost 5-minute experience. Everyone is handwaving here.

This, or something similar, is a common portfolio.  Say you’re younger and you want to be slightly more aggresssive and by more growth stocks over value, you can add more in QQQ to achieve that. Get more returns, with more risk, when you don’t have to worry about a crash nearing retirement.

Even though SPY and VTI have many of the same holdings, it also has much more and lots of value stocks, so by adding 5-15% QQQ you’re increasing your exposure to more tech and growth stocks. It’s more volatile, but generally grows faster.

So instead of thinking of it as overlap, I’m using it to make my portfolio a little more risky beyond the S&P 500.

But if that was your intention, you don’t really need NOBL. That’s a lower risk, lower return fund. On the flip side…. Say you keep $20k in your savings account, but want to be able to access another  $40k in safer assets in your investment nets for bad years where there is a crash and lost of a job, the. You might choose to make $40k in investments in bond and low risk equity ETFs, and then everything over $40k follows the strategy you want.

What you could do is buy more small caps and mid caps. I like to keep 10-20% in small and midcaps. The Russell 2000 and the S&P 400 are indexes that will accomplish this. Mid caps over long periods have outcompeted the S&P 500, but tends to be more volatile.

Another thing you can consider is getting SPYG and SPYV instead of SPY and you can balance your own ratio between growth and value stocks. You’ll have to rebalance them over time when one grows more than the other.",,

250,,2021-05-25 00:51:00,t3_nkd1hk,,stocks," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

295,gzc8ss5,2021-05-25 01:07:09,t1_gzc8ss5,t3_njmeaw,stocks,"I look for what I feel is a good company with damaged reputation.  The odd thing is, when I talk about investing in these kinds of companies, people always down them and talk about the possibility of bankruptcy.  The reality is, if you invest in a company that is at its best, where do you expect it to go?

During the pandemic I looked at carnival Cruise lines, it had been on a downwards trend prior to the pandemic, but took a beating during the pandemic.  March of last year I invested into carnival Cruise lines, about a month later the stock had already lost about a third of its value from where I bought in, so I bought more... I have achieved about a 200% profit on that stock now, it is close to three times my original investment.  I expect it's got about another 25 to 30% over its current value once it's full up and running again.  I don't expect it to get to his pre-pandemic stock value due to dilution and debt.

I had looked at Boeing a long time ago when the max got grounded. I'm kind of glad I didn't buy into it back then, because it took a long time before the fixed it and started delivering them again.  More recently they had a couple aircraft have their engines come apart in flight. Pratt and Whitney engines.  Pratt & Whitney is a private company, I can't invest in them through stocks. So... I invested in Boeing. It was trading about 250 when I bought into it, was trading at about 350 pre-pandemic.  I expect it to get back up to 350 when things are full up and running.  It drops since I first bought into it, so I buy a couple shares here, couple shares there. It's trading at less than 250 now, but I'm in the positive on it.

Rolls-royce, their premier engine had problems, hollow veins that were cracking.  This one is so cheap it's almost like a penny stock. It seems to go nowhere, hovering right around a buck 50 right now.  I don't expect this to go anywhere short-term, but I do expect it to double over the next two or three years.  So whenever I have extra cash in my portfolio, I buy a few shares.

I'm not recommending any of these stocks, I'm just trying to explain my thought process behind how I invest.

The stocks that I've taken the biggest beating on, namely SPACS, are ones I've heard about through other people, and follow their advice.  I definitely don't know everything, and I'm paying my tuition to learn, but I think I'll paddle my own boat from now on and not follow what other people say.

400,,2021-05-25 01:54:42,t3_nke9vc,,stocks,"Nautilus, Ticker NLS. This company is about 20% short, has 113 million in cash in the bank with just under 15 million in debt, has a market cap of 500 million. They have generated about 80 million over the past 2 quarters as well. We have a major catalyst still….people aren’t running to the gym. If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

[VW Outlines the Math Behind Its Autonomous Service Plans](https://ark-invest.com/newsletters/issue-271/?utm_content=168006531&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084)

> In a recent interview, Klaus Zellmer, Board Member responsible for Sales, Marketing and After-Sales at its passenger car division, said that if Volkswagen launches an autonomous service, it could charge vehicle owners 7 euros per hour and hit profitability. If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK’s estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.

> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW’s autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.

> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future. ARK will continue to monitor VW’s progress.

Why is ARK Invest still emphasizing autonomous driving technology?

The bull case for Tesla (TSLA) has always been much stronger on the second-life energy storage front than on the autonomous driving technology front.  Only today is Tesla reconsidering its earlier rejection of lidar technology, but that's because there has been a credible embrace of it.

Tesla has made its bet with Luminar Technologies (LAZR) because [Volkswagen has embraced lidar technology and made its bet with Argo AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/naooit/electric_vehicle_volkswagen_embraces_lidar_for/).

Nonetheless, just like with Tesla, the [bull case for the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mnxdex/oops_dd_underestimated_volkswagen_by_2025_could/) is, in my opinion, much stronger on other fronts: scale, charging networks, bidirectional charging technology, the company's own planned foray into second-life energy storage, and so on.",nkehy3,"Is ARK Invest changing its mind on electric vehicle maker Volkswagen?

Scenario #1) I like to keep my dividend and REIT stocks in the Roth. Typically, I'm looking for low PE and high yield (typically over 3%, but some in the 4-6% range). Anyway, I've seen a lot of these stocks appreciate significantly. In 2021 alone, I sold positions that appreciated 29%, 15%, and 18% respectively. My thought process was: I bought those stocks with the expectation to make $x return over the next y years in dividends. However, since the appreciation was so good, I hit that goal in just a few months. Sure, the dividends didn't change, but the yield did! So, now instead of getting 3% on my positions, I'm getting somewhere in the twos. Why stick around? So, I move out of those positions into others that can return 3% or more. 

Scenario #2) I try to minimize taxes in my taxable account. For example: A year ago, I had a huge loser. I didn't want to be in that position any more so I sold it. However, I didn't want that loss to go unrewarded so I also sold a winner. I bought the winner right back. The idea was to get a higher cost basis on that stock while still keeping it. This means when I actually sell it, I will pay less capital gains. Is this a good strategy?

We can use the Dow index as a measure of the broad value and cyclical stocks and Nasdaq for the growth/tech. The US economy is in full swing towards reopening and it’s rebound in the values is already being seen, with Dow being up 12% YTD and Nasdaq trailing by half the amount at 6% YTD. 

Value stocks are typically the companies that are “boring”, companies that are typically matured and have consistent and predictable revenue streams. While growth stocks are usually the ones that companies might not have positive earnings, but have good future outlooks. Stocks that look for innovation and development in new industries, etc. Tech is often mixed into growth as majority of Tech stocks are built around innovation.

A split is done in hopes of getting more investors and then raising again their share price. A reverse split is not so encouraging because it is looked upon as the company is struggling to maintain compliance. Both are done strategically to help the company in the long run.

TSLA isn't reconsidering LIDAR despite many claims that suggest they are. 

What is really going on, is that *TSLA has been using LIDAR to calibrate their vision range detection for years*, and someone took a picture of this setup. This means that every now and then they use a handful of LIDAR fitted Teslas to ensure the distance measurements that Autopilot/FSD are predicting are working accurately enough, and make any adjustments if needed to the system, so that they are working accurately enough. This doesn't imply they intend to start using LIDAR on the Teslas they sell.

Here is an article from 2016 that is also proposing that Tesla is going to be using LIDAR because it uses LIDAR for calibration, and stands by it's reporting even (after 5 years it seems to they still haven't moved to LIDAR):  
[https://www.thedrive.com/news/5804/elon-musk-may-be-secretly-planning-to-use-lidar-in-future-tesla-models-updated](https://www.thedrive.com/news/5804/elon-musk-may-be-secretly-planning-to-use-lidar-in-future-tesla-models-updated)

It has an official response from tesla (when they did have a PR department) at the end that reads:

>A spokesperson for Tesla responded with this statement: ""The claim that Tesla may be planning to use LiDAR as part of its self-driving hardware suite is fundamentally untrue. We regularly test our own technologies against other sensors to calibrate our camera, sonar and radar system.""

This is not anything new, it's probably something that's been done since they rejected LIDAR in the first place (if you are going to reject a sensor, verify that your system can do everything as well as if it had that sensor).",,

I opened a SoFi account about 2 years ago for the debit card that reimburses all ATM fees (discontinued - but I’m grandfathered). At the time I banked with Chase. A year ago I moved to southwest Missouri for med school and discovered that there’s no Chase branch within 200 miles of me here. Rather than open a bank account with a local bank in my area, I decided to just give Sofi a shot as my primary banking solution and honestly I don’t see myself ever using a brick and mortar bank again.

It’s been nearly a year now since Sofi became my primary bank account and it works just fine for me. Really the only downside to using Sofi as my primary bank is that if I have to make a cash deposit (which is rare) I either have to pay a 5$ fee to make a green dot deposit at a Walgreens or cvs or deposit to another bank and then transfer.

>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

But for amazon the anti-trust argument to split up Amazon seems like a weak one to me.  Why/how are they a monopoly? Because people buy anything retail from their online stores? Ebay and Alibaba are two big boy competitors in ecommerce. But perhaps the argument is specifically about brick and mortar stores? Walmart and Costco are going nowhere, in fact they're both just getting bigger. So Amazon has lots of health competition in the (e)commerce space. 

And how about AWS/cloud? Now, this is an area they truly are dominant in, with respect to market share. But with Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud being great alternatives I don't see the monopoly argument here either.

&#x200B;

In bank accounts you get protections from the FDIC. In investing accounts you get protections through SIPC. These are things that help make sure you are protected, up a certain amount of money, if the financial institution goes under your assets are protected.

You don't have that with a Futures account.

Regulation is done through the CFTC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They regulate often through industry groups set up by commodity exchanges. They are are also more passive and provide a legal area where people make claims against each other on contracts. 

Futures are often leveraged. You can lose more than what you invest into it and they can get significantly risky. If something big happened in the market it is possible some couldn't pay their contract and there could be a shortage of money/run on money of futures account holders. 

I'd also note that financial futures trading is relatively new in the last few decades. Back in the '70s it was primarily for hedging for agricultural crops and mining operations, many of the regulations for the market have been established in the last few decades.

This means they haven't hammered out all the rules, not have they seen all the problems they might arise from financial futures trading during market conditions this trading hasn't been through yet.

827,gzdbktb,2021-05-25 08:17:07,t1_gzdbktb,t1_gzaw5q8,stocks,"It's already very easy to borrow.  They're not engaging in negative interest rates, but they are engaging in quantitative easing, which means buying up assets apart from just US treasuries.  These operations are at $120B per month right now, which is huge. 

In my understanding negative interest rates have never been implemented in the US, and politically I'm not sure how viable they would be. They're already very low, just not negative.

As for why they might raise rates, you have to keep in mind that the Fed has a dual mandate: full employment, and stable price levels. The point of lowering rates and QE is precisely what you said: stimulating the economy, making borrowing easier and hopefully creating jobs.  

You can't just engage in QE forever, however.  QE is basically printing money, because the Fed buys assets with money it creates electronically.  If they create too much money and there's too much of it sloshing around in the economy, then this raises prices on goods and services, which is inflation.

The general economic consensus is that some inflation (generally 2%, but even 4%) is good because it's better to have an excess of money than not enough.  This facilitates growth.  

However, more than that is a problem because prices start to become unreliable.  With 10% inflation something that cost you $100 last year would cost you $110, which is significant.  People don't know how to price things which leads to confusion and a lost of faith in the dollar.

So the Fed is playing a balancing act of stimulating the economy and thus creating jobs, while at the same time trying not to go overboard and keeping price levels steady.  Remember, this is their mandate.

With Covid the concern is actually *deflation*, because production and spending have been gutted, causing prices to fall.  That's why they're still engaging in QE and encouraging some inflation... they want to bring the economy back to full employment and health. 

There are some fears that they may be running a bit hot and inflation will cause them to need to raise rates sooner rather than later.",,

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Do your own research of course but just keep those two things in mind because they are indicators of a financial crisis just like what happened in 2008. Mortgages defaulting and heavy sales of mortgage back securities are a recipe for disaster. This is the major con in my opinion. Secondly stock prices are set to drop when collateral is called in. Since big firms own lots of these stocks because they are seen as relatively safe there will be a sell off. I guess the pro is it could drag on a little and you could make some money in the short term. But is it really worth the risk. Best of luck.",,

Weird comment there, to be honest. The stock is splitting - currently at nearly 650 it was at 580 before the announcement.  After a split it would still have traded at 145 a share at pre-announcement prices for the same market cap. At what price do you think a company should consider splitting their stock?

The only fundamental that changes is the number of shares outstanding which will rise from 622M to 2.45 billion. If you're referring to the market cap of the company (around 385 billion) not being supported by the recent results then OK, it seems a bit overvalued based on P/E and P/S ratios, but that didn't stop them running up to nearly 600 per share before any discussion of a split.",,

I am a small youtuber that would like to provide the best videos for people like you interested in the stock market and I thought it would be nice to know what you expect to see in videos about that!

* When you are researching a stock, what do you usually take a look at? Do you just do research on google and see where it takes you, or do you have a usual way of proceeding?
* Do you often go on YouTube to learn more about a stock? If you do, what do  you usually expect from a video you are watching? Is it more general information like how the business works, what the industry looks like, what are the financials? Or is it more for technical analysis with charts and everything?
* When listening to a video, what is the most crucial information you want to have to feel like the video was not a complete waste of your time?
* Finally, is there anything you love from certain youtubers that make you come back? Or that you hate and make you never click on their video again?

But it is true. Nio has opened a showroom in a space that couldnt be more prominent in one of the more upscale shopping malls. There is always someone inside but it is not really crowded.
