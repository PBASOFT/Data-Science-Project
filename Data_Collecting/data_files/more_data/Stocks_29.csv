Like most reddit sheeple I invested in AMC when the stonks short stuff was happening, and I had a few questions about investing in general.  Disclaimer, I also did this with no guidance or general knowledge, so I'm also still relatively clueless of the ins and outs.

I understand if I were to sell stocks within a year of me buying I will be taxed, but if I were to sell it and reinvest into another company would I still be taxed?

And If I were to make a Roth IRA account, would stocks I own be able to be in that account?

I did all of this investing through Vanguard which was told to me is a good option for investing.  And I understand that through vanguard there are a few options of how you invest through a roth ira.

Last question, I recently got a 401k with my new job and I understand that you can fund a roth IRA with a 401k, but how quickly can that happen? I don't know alot about 401ks, but I imagine they take a portion from each check to go towards retirement, and just curious if I can on a monthly basis use that to fund a roth?

Thank you, also I just want to repeat I have pretty limited knowledge on how this stuff works and I appreciate any and all help!",nm1lps,Investing Questions

54,gzm28vg,2021-05-27 07:38:57,t1_gzm28vg,t3_nm1lps,stocks,"Hey! Let me try and answer some of your questions - 
1. AMC - hey, a lot of people got in on investing with GME and AMC, so don‚Äôt sweat it. However know that those are very rare events and are not likely to happen again. Your learning should be that don‚Äôt invest in hype / meme stocks. Start with ETFs (VTI, QQQ etc.). Invest in companies that you believe in. This has been repeated multiple times - Time in the Market beats Timing the Market. What that means is that play the long game, hold stocks long term and react based on how those companies are performing. 

2. Taxes / Short term vs. Long term gains - Any profit you realize will be taxed. So if you buy a stock and sell for profit - the profit is taxed. How much it is taxed depends on how long you have held your position. If you hold for longer than a year, you fall into long term capital gains tax, which is lower than short term capital gains which is taxed as ordinary income. The profit will be taxable irrespective. Even if you invest it somewhere else, you are taxed on the profit you made from the sale.

3. 401K and Roth IRA are tax advantaged retirement schemes. You can‚Äôt transfer stocks from your brokerage to your retirement fund. However, you can use your 401K/IRA funds to invest in different portfolios. I would suggest not to gamble with your retirement money. Choose a risk profile depending on your age / appetite and let that money compound and grow. Use extra money to invest in individual stocks. 

4. You will have a different account for each service - A Vanguard Brokerage account, a Roth IRA account, 401K etc. They are different from each other and not part of the same pool of money. 

5. I am not sure about funding a Roth IRA using 401K. They are quite different. For your 401K, you are deducted pre tax, but are taxed when you get the money back at retirement. For Roth IRA - you contribute post tax money, however, when you withdraw at retirement, you don‚Äôt pay any tax. 

There are lots of articles out there that go into the basics of your question. Take some time to read up on those. Hope this helps.",,

But that said the market is the market, you could have 10 identical companies but only 1 of them comes out as the one increasing by far the most, so do you want to invest into all 10 and divide profits/losses or hope to find the 1 increasing so much? In reality it's not 1 and 10, but 10 to 1000 or even more, depending on which sector and what you are looking for. And both will result in kind of the same. The less stocks you choose to invest in, the higher the risk of underperforming or even face losses. The more stocks you invest in, the lower the risk of underperformed but you will minimize potential profits.

And if you now take 100 people that invest into 1-2 stocks the 10 of them that were successful will tell you that its better to do so, while the 90 that underperformed the S&P 500 or had a loss will either stop trading or not talk about it, giving you a wrong perception.",,

It has a Div Rate of $.11, current price at 19.73 and most recently beat it's EPS by $.13 and it's revenue by $12.51 on May 7th.

There are so many great factors that continue to help it's case. Housing market is red hot, analyst consensus currently has them earning $1.02 this year in EPS and by 2023 at $1.50.

While lumber gets most of the talk on shortages, windows and doors are second. For its most recent quarter, its gross margins surged more than 700 basis points. That's nearly unheard of for an industrial company.

On a more personal note, as someone with a connection to Miami, TGLS produces by far the most superior product the the PGT and CGI glass found elsewhere. It is THE top of the line glass and if it can handle the Hurricane season in Miami, it can absolutely expand evenmoreso in future years.

As one person wrote, "" I tell anyone that I meet on social media or around Brickell, to consider living only in a building that has TGLS glass.""

The company even today is STILL undervalued and is rarely if ever mentioned in the mainstream or major investment websites. NOW is the best time to jump in and take advantage on a nice dip (such as today when it was down 3%) while there is still time.

It will need a lot of help like a bunch of co processors along every group of sensors or more cores or some good way to thread, or a GPU, etc. And even then, there are measurable limits that are hard to overcome in binary. This is where the quantum would excel. It may not be very fast at operations, but it can do a ton of them at once (in theory).

One thing I will say is I have a feeling that the quantum computer is likely to become more of a add-on to current computer rather than replace them. This would give you the best of both worlds. Think GPU or math co-processor (like back in the day). In time it will probably get integrated into a CPU or GPU.",,

The cost of gas is minimal compared to what people spend in housing, healthcare and taxes. My cars always costed more in maintenance and insurance than in gas and I travel a lot. And plane tickets are just marginally affected by oil prices as well. No more than 20% of a ticket costs is out of fuel. If the fuel doubles the price (impossible) the ticket will increase from $100 to $120, hardly beyond the change of plans threshold of those who can afford travelling by air. Most of the costs are maintenance, capital immobilization of expensive airplanes, airport use, staff and taxes.

?? I stand to what I said. The solution is much cheaper than diluting the higher fuel prices into the whole society. A small bump in fuel prices makes little difference in demand, but people will get poorer out of it (even if just a small fraction out of everyone).

LMP Motors $LMPX 's business model as ‚ÄúBuy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.‚Äù This means that we ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. LMPX Rents or Subscribe‚Äù by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. LMPX then sells its inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to ‚ÄúRepeat‚Äù the whole process.

**IPO and Price History:**

LMPX IPO'd in December 2019 at 5$ per share and has steadily increased throughout the past 18 months, reaching a peak of $45 earlier this year. It has since retraced in price and is currently trading at $15.8. This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M.

LMPX was trading at a market cap of above 350M earlier this year but has since sold off. (meets criteria to be posted on this sub)

**Revenue Growth and Forecast:**

LMPX reported 10.8m of revenues in 2019 and grew revenues to 30.4m for 2020. Representing a 180% increase in Revenues YoY.

LMPX forecasted revenues of 29m to 31m for Q1 2021 representing a 650% increase in revenues from Q4 2020.

LMPX full year 2021 revenues forecasted at 535 million

Shareholders called out the CEO on these revenues forecasts after Q4 results and the stock subsequently sold off.

**Q1 2021 Earnings Preliminary Numbers (To be reported after close tomorrow)**

LMPX quietly released its preliminary numbers last week directly to the SEC.

Reporting Revenues of $33m, representing 725% increase in revenues from the previous quarter.

Gross profit increased to 6M from 500k the previous quarter.

Cash increased of 1.4M to 19.4m through net operating cash flows.

These preliminary numbers beat the Q1 Guidance of 29M-31M by 15%.

The earnings call tomorrow will prove to shareholders and investors that this company is achieving substantial growth and the the forecasts are obtainable.

Guidance for the 2021 year is expected to increase above its 535 million to 570 million+.

**EBITDA:** EBITDA expected at 4.4% for 2021 of total revenues amounting to 25million which is to be used for repayment of loans on recent acquisitions.

**Valuation to Peers:**

**CVNA:**

Market Cap of 44.7B

Sales of 5.5B

P/S: 8.12

Revenue growth YoY: 41%

**VRM:**

Market Cap of 5.9B

Sales of 1.3B

P/S: 4.53

Revenue growth YoY: 14%

**LMPX:**

Market Cap of 158M

Sales of : 33M for Q1 (570M 2021 full year)

P/S: 0.27 (based on 2021 revenue Guidance)

Revenue growth YoY: 1766% (2020 to 2021 growth)

**LMPX** **Fair Value based on 2021 Sales:**

Market Cap: 2.5B

Share price: $256

P/S: 4.5

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 535 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings resulting in increased guidance.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after tomorrows earnings resulting in a even smaller tradeable float.

**Summary:**

LMPX will report revenues of 33M tonight representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". This earnings report will beat expectations by 10-15% and Revenue guidance is expected to be bumped higher to the high 570 million range. New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader. If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 550M+ revenue for 2021 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $250+ a share representing a 1582% increase from its current share price.

Get in on the ground floor before the earnings call today. LMPX ran today as investors started to catch on to the SEC filing of preliminary numbers. We should see a 20% + move after hours tomorrow and quick run back to its ATH of $45.",nm4il0,LMPX - LMP Motors - Growth Monster and Earnings Beat Coming After Hours Today

# The Balance Sheet

>A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.  
Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

# Overview of whats in it

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** **https://imgur.com/WZNIuBY**

# Assets

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/3UVsD43**](https://imgur.com/3UVsD43)   
>  
>An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren‚Äôt expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners‚Äô equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:  

   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (>50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company‚Äôs financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

# Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.  

   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company‚Äôs asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder‚Äôs Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders‚Äô equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders‚Äô equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions.",nm4kla,Accounting 101 - Part 2: The Balance Sheet

You own a car because you can use it as you please, for example.

So you are right in the sense that as a common investors, since stock ownership doesn‚Äôt give you any practical control on the business you ‚Äúown‚Äù, you don‚Äôt really own it.

Shares have value because of a social contract. Management is expected to act with your interests in mind. You basically have to trust them.
Sure, you can sue if they don‚Äôt respect their duties, but if it comes to that you are unlikely to successfully extract much value back from the whole endeavor, plus the wasted time and effort.

In practice then, **value comes mostly from trust**. Your trust that the company will act in your best interest. And the trust of other investors that, believing the same, will be willing to buy the company‚Äôs shares from you.

As you noticed, some companies don‚Äôt give back money to shareholders either directly with dividends or indirectly by buybacks, so **owning shares is like owning fiat money**.

Hey guys! 
Cards on the table, I know very little about the stock market and how it works. I understand the concept of return on investment, capital gains, high risk vs low risk, etc.

I‚Äôm just looking for advice on what I should do with the 5k sitting in ‚Äúcash investments‚Äù for my contributory IRA. It used to be a profit sharing account managed by my old company‚Äôs accounting firm, but I quit that job and moved across the country.

* For individual stocks, option/leverage plays, actively managed funds, or crazy unpredictable stuff (bitcoin, etc), the risk is it jumping to zero or at least a very low bottom it never gets out of.
* For market-wide index ETFs, it increases the negative swings, so in case of a crash a more volatile fund might drop 60%, a less volatile one only 30%. If you, for whatever reason, need that money in times of a downswing and have to sell, you‚Äôre losing out.

The latter, IMO, can be outweighed by even higher upward swings if you‚Äôre thinking long-term (10+ years). If we're talking 20 years, the NASDAQ 100 beat the S&P 500, even if you entered at the peak of the dot com bubble. It just took 15 years or so.

I have a concrete example. I‚Äôm not from the US, so world-market ETFs are more interesting to me and I‚Äôve been looking at the returns of two specific examples:

iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

iShares Edge MSCI World Momentum Factor UCITS ETF (Acc)

Both track the MSCI but the latter adds a [momentum factor](https://www.msci.com/eqb/methodology/meth_docs/MSCI_Momentum_Indexes_Methodology_June2017.pdf). That sounds a bit scary to me but the results are [convincing.](https://i.imgur.com/9eJ0lfE.jpg) If I started in 2014, the March 2020 low would still be higher than that of the non-momentum index. [Here‚Äôs a chart going all the way back to 2007](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/904e031c-94e4-4dbc-a314-7c373446dffa) and it doesn‚Äôt look bad, either.

I haven‚Äôt found charts going further back, so I wonder, for example, what would have happened during the dot com bubble (for reference: The current highest holding in the momentum index is Tesla with a PE ratio of 620). But I don‚Äôt see how it would have been drastically different and it would have swung out of dot com shit within 6 months back then.

I‚Äôm trying to be careful so: Am I missing something? To me it seems that for *almost* the same risk, I get *much* better returns long term with the momentum factor.",nm5s7u,"For larger market ETFs, is there a downside to higher volatility other than the emotional burden?"

I have followed / opened a LOT of news stories of this supposed criticism, but none of them go into what, specifically, is being asked of these oil companies.  And, somehow, 'Green' board members are being forced into companies that cater to those of us who prefer to use internal combustion engines.  It just seems like it's a backward attempt to make the world all use electric vehicles, and that many 'News' sites are in on the propaganda, but none of them are doing investigative reporting to discern just who is demanding lower carbon footprints from oil companies, why (what their motives are), and to what end they are expecting change.

Examples:

Your portfolio target is 60% S&P 500 and 40% Total market.
The S&P outperformed the market and you now have 65% S&P and 35% To. mkt.

Should you in your next contribution ...

1) add 60% of it to the S&P and 40% to the Tot. Mkt?

or

2) add to the Tot. mkt. till it's at 40% again? / allocate it so it stays as close to 60/40 as possible?

1) has the advantage of that you‚Äòre still contributing to the winning positions that might continue to outperform, but you need to rebalance regularily.
2) has the advantage of sticking to the right risk tolerance for you and not having to rebalance nearly as often but doesn‚Äòt add to winning positions.

My question is, which makes the most sense? This mostly relates to portfolios that are small compared to your regular contribution (definitely for under 5y/o portfolios or if you‚Äòre seeing massive income growth) because eventually you can‚Äòt make a dent in the allocation and just have to rebalance regularily anyways so it makes little diference.",nm63mh,Portfolio allocation balancing advice

That said, if weights are really out of balance due to large gains in one or more of your assets, it might be beneficial to rethink your strategy to make sure it makes sense given current state of market.

So. 
1: You can realize some of the gains to get to right balance and this will give you some cash to see where things go in the next few: days, weeks, months. Ie new buying opportunities.

2:Add to under-performer to meet ratio. ie Get portfolio risk back to prior level.

3: Or add to both at a ratio that gets you to 60/40. ie Easiest to manage.

Im a fan of combining 1 and 3.",,

Basically as a natural gas producer (AR) and their associated pipeline (AM) both companies were hurt badly by the covid shutdown and the market drove their share prices down due to perceived bankruptcy risk.  They have since recovered and the market agrees as shown by their appreciated share prices.  

Since they are energy companies they have high debt to cover their high demand for assets, but that is typical for the industry.  The question is whether they have the cash flow to pay the interest and when full debt repayment is due whether they can pay or refinance to a longer term.  IMO both AR and AM have done an excellent job navigating this crisis with their debt service well managed and under control.  AR's cash flow has increased significantly to the point where they will likely either initiate a share buyback or start paying a dividend in the next year or so.  AM continues to pay a good dividend- currently 9.3%.

I own shares in both, which have become my largest holdings, and am not selling or thinking about thinking about selling.  Perform your own DD, but IMO both are among the best options for investing in natural gas.",,

>Current assets include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year

>Noncurrent assets include long-term investments that aren‚Äôt expected to be converted into cash in the short term

This is not true and could make readers believe that are assets will be converted into cash at some point.

Here is the definition of an asset as per IFRS : An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.

An asset would not necessarily result in cash in the future. It could be traded for another assets. It could simply be useful in order to produce something (e.g. permit for the lumber industry or mining industry). So if you see an entity with 1B of assets, that does not mean that the entity will have 1B of cash in the future.",,

680,gzmzu8x,2021-05-27 14:12:03,t1_gzmzu8x,t3_nm5s7u,stocks,"So, there's a common misconception for a number of investors between *risk* and *volatility*. Volatility refers purely to price action - how dispersed prices are around the mean. Volatility really just gives you a frame of reference for the typical distribution profile of some investment. Risk, on the other hand, is the chance that an event has an effect on the investment thesis. This can include known risks (regulatory risk, which materialized with BABA as legal harassment from the CCP) and unknown risks (like with early stage companies, where there is an indefinite number of things that can go wrong leading up to profitability). 

 Not investment advice, but major things I'd look at here in terms of risk: 

1. The distinction between the Momentum Index and the Momentum Tilt index. Make sure you know which one you want - the former is riskier by virtue of being less diversified. 
2. What's in the rest of your portfolio? One thing to be careful of with factor ETFs is that many can have you unknowingly over-exposed to the same particular companies. For instance, if your other holdings (even if ETFs) are heavily weighted to AMZN, TSLA, MSFT and AAPL you're going to be adding idiosyncratic exposure to these companies by virtue of the fact that they are ""high momentum"" currently. Look at the sector/ region exposure while you're at it. 
3. The biggest thing that worries me about this is the ad-hoc rebalancing criteria. The index rebalances twice a year (quite infrequent, in the scheme of things) and has an ad-hoc rebalancing criteria that seeks volatility above the 95th percentile of index history. I would do a little work in a spreadsheet to find out what this means in practice, because you may wind up about 6 months behind major market regime shifts. Try comparing this to other ETFs with similar style tilts while you're at it.",,

It was a press release from Dow Jones:

>>>  ""Shipment and revenue declines reflected the natural seasonal pattern in our distributed generation business, combined with our ongoing pause in large scale. Gross margins were relatively stable considering the volume decline, with better average selling prices offsetting volume deleveraging,"" Chief Executive Jeff Waters said.

""Operating expenses ran higher sequentially, but in line with projections. As we conclude the remaining SunPower separation activities, we expect to bring operating expenses down in the quarters ahead,"" Mr. Waters said.

Raymond James said in a note, which reiterated its Strong Buy rating, that ""as had been telegraphed in April, cost pressure vis-a-vis glass, cells, and logistics - an industrywide trend - was a noticeable headwind.""

Maxeon guided for second-quarter shipments of 415 MW to 475 MW and revenue of $165 million to $185 million.

""As with the entire value chain, input cost inflation remains a headwind in 2Q,"" Raymond James said in its note.

""There is no avoiding the current headwind from input cost inflation ... but history's lesson is that everything in the solar space is fundamentally a commodity, and all bottlenecks are always transitory,"" the analyst note said.

Raymond James noted that ""SunPower's guidance is even more back-end-weighted than usual,"" which the firm said translates into a stronger second half for Maxeon.",,

All central banks downplay inflation. Always have, always will. The CPI is designed to downplay inflation. This isn‚Äôt lying but rather forcing the market to show it‚Äôs true colors rather than being reactionary to Central Banks comments. And it‚Äôs quite obvious the Central Banks aren‚Äôt going to make kneejerk reactions to 1 month of data. Nor should they.

That said, Bank of Canada basically said they are raising rates in 2022. They are also already scaling back bond purchases. They have other means of slowing down stimulus before they raise rates. That‚Äôll take months anyways and viola, 2022 is here.

Bank of England said inflation was transitionary, but they are monitoring closely. Lack of conviction, framing an easy out. They also are thinking inflation is transitionary because of weak wage growth.

However, in the US, via stimulus, the effective minimum wage has risen to $15/hour. Democrats backdoored that via unemployment benefits. Businesses are being forced to pay above unemployment or lose business; and they are raising wages. 3 months to go on that with no word on if it will be extended or they will push a permanent $15/hour min wage.

You have a variable risk target - the usual approach is to set the risk target independently and go from there. This is going to represent one ""variance unit"" in your portfolio. 

Now you'll need to solve a system of equations. Given P (Portfolio value), a (number of VOO shares), b (number of VTI shares), VOO and VTI (prices, respectively): 

1. P = aVOO + bVTI
2. P / STDEV (P) = a(VOO)/ 0.6STDEV(VOO) + b(VTI)/0.4STDEV(VTI)

Along comes McDonald's.  They're already a public company. They've done all the complex work.  They agreed to buy you.  It's a pretty fast and easy acquisition type of transaction, much simpler and quicker than going public yourself.  You go from owning shares of your own private business to shares of a public business, without the headache and risk of an IPO.  

Now consider the same scenario, except it's not McDonalds, it's some other company that is public but their main focus so far is just finding some business like yours to acquire.  They're already public, so that part is done. It's just a matter of making sure the have investors with the money and then working out what everyone thinks is an ok price.  

From the retail investor side, they've going tired of IPO's.  They've seen time and again where only ultra rich insiders get a chance to buy them, and even they have no visibility into how much they'll be allocated.  Nobody knows what day it will happen, or even what time when that day is set.  Even up to the last second, nobody knows what price they'll be paying or what the venture they're investing in is even worth.  And what it's worth in the morning can be radically higher or lower later that day.  It's a blind crapshoot.  A spac takes a lot of that nonsense away.  The venture is soberly considered over a period of months.  A price and valuation are arrived at in a non-hurried and somewhat sane manner.

Bezos, for all the hype he gets, has been largely disengaged from Amazon the company for many years now.  Long story short, used to heavily involved with an Amazon-related business many, many years ago.  Significant enough to be dealing with the ring around Bezos.  Noticed a huge change in what had been a constructive relationship.  He became a figure in name only, with a literal simulated office crew.  Can't blame him, as I'd also check out too, at much lower levels of personal wealth.  The point here is that losing Bezos isn't really the loss the media made it out to be. 

Second is that I've observed in a lot of highly successful enterprises, there's some unheralded person or people that have and drive the most awesome ideas, if the leadership allows.  The point here is that most of the brilliant strategies and execution of the last couple decades, that behind the scenes genius has been Jassy.  And again, contrary to initial media reports, him being named was very good news, not bad or unknowable.

Ford is not trying to reinvent the wheel and they‚Äôre not trying to be the Apple of the automotive industry like Tesla or the aspirational pipe dream companies (e.g., Rivian, Lordstown, Nikola) are all trying to be. Ford recognizes that until fully autonomous vehicles become a practical reality for the average consumer, most people will not want their driving experience to change all that much. Most people don‚Äôt want to feel like they‚Äôre in a minimalist spaceship despite what the Tesla circlejerk would have you believe (although I‚Äôm also long TSLA for other reasons which I‚Äôll explain below). Ford‚Äôs electrified vehicles feel more like a typical car. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a radical change in your daily driving experience. Most people don‚Äôt like radical and rapid change. They like what they are familiar with. Ford gets that. The F-150 Lightening shows that they get it.

Ford is going all in on electric. So is VW and GM. Through their collective weight, institutional knowledge bases, and economies of scale they‚Äôre going to eventually crush Tesla and all the relatively new automotive manufacturers who all want to fundamentally and radically change people‚Äôs driving experiences. In 2020 Tesla delivered roughly 500,000 vehicles globally. Compare that to Ford delivering nearly 4.2 million (and in non pandemic years Ford is pushing 6 million deliveries annually). Volkswagen Group delivered 9.2 million vehicles across all brands in 2020. I just don‚Äôt think Tesla can stay competitive as a mass market auto manufacturer in the long run despite their impressive growth in production in recent years.

Where Tesla can excel (and this is why I‚Äôm long TSLA) is by pivoting to becoming an OEM supplier of batteries to major automakers like Ford and VW Group who have gone all in on electric and have the production capacity to drown out Tesla as an automaker. Tesla knows high capacity batteries better than just about anyone. But more importantly, Tesla understands how to produce large quantities of batteries and is constantly pursuing ways to expand their already impressive battery production capabilities. They have the potential to become the go to energy storage solutions provider to everything ranging from the automotive industry to construction/heavy industry and utilities/power producers. Tesla was only able to make the demand for high capacity batteries that currently exists by stimulating the growth of the EV market with their own cars. But they‚Äôve done that, and I think they‚Äôll eventually back out of the business of building cars and selling them to consumers (at least if they‚Äôre smart). 

Ford is a great automaker play. Tesla is a great battery and energy storage play. It‚Äôs frustrating for me to see people constantly compare the two to each other.

But it's not just about raw differential, it's also about derivatives of that, such as how the relative curves are moving, and how quickly.  

You also have parameters that can influence things.  One such parameter was made clear in a recent bank conference call in which the CEO said certain large customer segments have 3-7x as much in their savings accounts than they did prior to the pandemic.

Higher rates means that banks make more money on the deposits they have.  They take in money in your savings accounts, cds, etc, and pay you  a fraction of what it is worth and then turn around and loan it out to someone else for a much higher rate (some of that is due to default risk etc).  The issue is that the spread between loan rate and savings rate use to be higher but because the fed rate is near zero and banks are unwilling to go negative on interest rates to their customer the spread has been shrinking.  As we saw when the fed rate was over 2% higher just 15 months ago most banks were still not passing on that extra rate to savers and were pocketing the difference.  Theoretically there is a max to this, where savings rates will eventually go up with the fed rate as well, but it has been so long since that has happened it may not go back up since consumers have gotten use to not getting paid much for their cash.",,
