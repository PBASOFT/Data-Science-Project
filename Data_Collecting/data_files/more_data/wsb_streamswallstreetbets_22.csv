Holding is a noble sentiment on the internet but most definitely is not always the smartest move to make in real life. 

I say this because while I can't complain about GME as it legitimately changed my life (this was during the ""real squeeze"" when I was up 1000% on my calls), I wish I had played it differently back then, listening more to reason than getting caught up in all the autistic screeching (which is still music to my ears btw). 

It's bittersweet in that I could have walked away with enough to pay off my parent's house as well as buy my own, but instead I had to settle for merely being completely debt free, and after taxes, having a big chunk of change in my TDAMeritrade account to play with.

Let’s start about how all of this started. Deep value on a nostalgic meme stonk. GME

WSB got its start from GME. No reason to go into that. We know the details.

Moving on to AMC. The poor persons GME derivative. 

This is kind of what I want to focus on in terms of sentiment.

WSB has been trading on chart speculation for months because it seems logical. You can talk about squeezes and shorts and short interest all you want, but all you monkeys are just looking for the next $9 moonshot in a day. 

I’ll tell you why AMC won’t get back up there again. Because people don’t believe it’s worth $25 or $30 and probably won’t be for 10 years if they start getting their shit together now.

I know you all agree that AMC isn’t deep value. It’s rose tinted nostalgia for times when we could commingle in public. 

Enough flat trading boomer talk. Let’s talk about value.

BB, PLTR, SPCE are meme stocks. They are meme stocks that actually have some kind of basis for future value. Whether highly speculative or optimistic, they represent good long decisions.

I wanted to touch on Ford because it beat the other automakers to market in terms of amazing marketing progress that millennials and Zoomers care about(electric) , while bringing in the boomer reliability of a stock that’s here to stay and grow. 

My option outlook for the next 6 weeks:

BB $12 strike in the next two months to capture an inevitable WSB hype train. Sell at 15 short term to keep profits.

PLTR: good value but no reason to push it short term. Shares or longer options near the money.

SPCE: watch closely and look for plays where you can buy $30 calls soon. Take your profits. Short term volatility. 

Ford: EV budgets are hype because it represents an alternative to crazy man Elon but also betting on one of the best selling automakers in the last 80 years. F150, mustang, lightning rebrand. Slipping in my bias here because I still daily drive my 2005 mustang. This is deep fucking value. 

TLDR: BB, PLTR, SPCE, F - get some kind of long position going on Tuesday.",no54ug,"Discussion on speculation/instinct trading. Let’s talk about SPCE, BB, PLTR, and Ford just for fun."

This means they borrow it and wait for it to fall then return it and keep the profits.. But a short squeeze is when we here force the stock up and they cant borrow those stocks forever so they have to return them at the now higher price which makes it go even higher.. Just trust the ppl and wait at least until you see something similar to what we saw premarket friday then sell 8min after opening if u just wanna do ur first gain and get some confidence then prepair cuz due to the vaccine amc will be up and running again within 6months and everyone will be going to the movies and getting out this is a long term hold to make the shorts cover they got billions invested in the failing of a company it almost goes against what Wall st u think used to want companies to grow but now they can make money off the success and failure of business which i think all of us feel is wrong so make em bleed and we make money!

479,,2021-05-30 06:55:55,t3_no5gqd,,wallstreetbets,"🍇 Chart update for $BB 🍇

Last friday we saw a first attempt to start a new uptrend. The first price target (12$) was reached in less than 24 hours. Subsequently the price got heavily rejected at the resistance level of 12$, forming a bearish candle. 

The volume on Friday was much higher than the average. The short sellers tried to push the share price down below the resistance at 12$ in order to avoid a further surge. I assume they are really  scared to see the price above that level because chartwise that means a bullish trend reversal. 

Next week Blackberry needs to break the resistance around 12$. Beyond 12$ there is almost no resistance besides the ATH. Furthermore the short interest rose during the consolidation since February. The percentage of float shorted is around 9% now (5/14/2021) which provides additional fuel for a squeeze. That means we could see a fast acceleration of the new uptrend. 

&#x200B;

If the share price of $BB falls below the support at 8.5$ the bullish scenario is **not valid** anymore. 

 

**Price targets:**

\#1 12$ ✅ 28th May

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

\#4 🚀🚀🚀

I am really curious on what drives everyone to really push a company‘s stock to the moon since I am working on a book and this chapter is really tough but really intersting, so your help is very very welcome and I would appreciate to get your honest opinions/comments.

This is my second book, first one was on startups and why they fail (available in German only) but I am aiming to write the investment book with a US publisher.

Good user comments get mentioned in the credits pnce the book is done.

First: What are the driving factors that influence your decisions?

1. high short interest?
2. wanting the company to survive?
3. sticking it to the shorts?
4. news and catalysts and long term value of the stock?
5. doesn’t matter just making money?
6. just following someone into a big ass YOLO?

Extreme example for two stocks out of two different industries that I have researched: 
You have a high short interest company that everybody finds cool (eg space travels, food, EV) and you have a high short interest company in an industry that everybody is just „meh“ (eg coal, steel, private prisons) but offers a chance to a squeeze. Short interest in both is about 50%.

If there‘s a chance to squeeze the living shit out of the shorts:

- Does it make a difference in which industry the company operates?
- Does moral matter more than making money when looking for squeeze opportunities?
- Do you think about moral factors when
going into a squeeze stock?

To disclose: I have taken positions in all kinds of stock that offer turnaround potential or squeeze potential and also have a YOLO position in a pretty controversial stock. So to me, making money outweighs moral factors although I want the world to become a better place. But I also know that this will take a while and in the meantime, I try to just benefit from situations out there also in companies, that I know many people hate, but that are - at least for now and the near future - just necessary, whether you like them or not.

If you want to add your 2cents on the question, thanks a lot in advance, your opinions and answers would contribute a lot!!",no66x7,Your feedback on a chapter for a book I am working on: „Squeeze vs. Moral“
