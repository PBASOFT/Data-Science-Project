Institutional volume is the majority of daily GME volume, not retail. Retail isn’t doing anything to hedge funds besides giving them more and more money on that one. 

AMC lacks the float and the share distribution to “short squeeze” in any real way, what you’re seeing is just regular buy/sell traffic and the occasional tweak to get you to buy more. 

Both have a retail buy/sell ratio that says retail holders (specifically) are running for the exits and getting other people to hold their bags. 

Institutional is under zero pressure from any of this. Unless the pressure is “where do we put all this money they’re giving us?”

If you go to weeklies the probability of success drops off dramatically. But if you go out to 2-3 months, you're getting 70%-80% success rates, so if you're ballsy that'd be 25%-30% of your portfolio you're betting.

AMC mooning is good for GME. No one who owns GME is selling for AMC. And when AMC moons it will likely cause GME to moon at the same time, or vice versa. Or even better, if AMC moons first, tons of apes will take their profits and put them into GME. Stop spreading AMC FUD cause both are legitimate plays and are beneficial to each other.

289,,2021-05-29 23:18:00,t3_nnynne,,wallstreetbets,"It was a beautiful day when BB 12c 6/18 departed for Tendie Town on May 28th. Departing on time at 9:30 AM it quickly reached a cruising altitude of $251 when the stock hit $12.09 at 10:09 AM. The crew and the passengers were elated but quickly started experiencing a variety of psychological issues as the plane descended quickly and eventually ended the day at $64 dollars. Alright enough of this stupid analogy.

Somewhere out there is some ape (or many) who bought this call at the high of the day and got rekt. From the peak value of the call to the end of the day he lost 75%.

There is a chance that BB will hit $14.51 by the end of the day on 6/18, but that doesn’t help the retard from not feeling the pain of a 75% drop and having 3 days to think about how many visits to the back of a Wendy’s he could have had. I think this plane may never make it to tendie town despite the number of rocket emojis you add. 

For the people who sold the call (thetagang), they arrived at tendie town and got hookers and cocaine and after that got to bang your wife’s BF.

Since I can't insert pics and shit while working on my tablet, I put it all into a pdf. Tired of editing it, deal with it. Seemed like an easy thing to write about in the beginning and have lost many hours where I could have watched someone bang my wife.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjCt-ShI6_0kAyLOtS8BsnTXWj66mxn8/view?usp=sharing

TLDR: On 5/28 I monitored the BB 12c 6/18 call and watched IV crush destroy someone who bought it at high. A warning to newbs to be careful with options. If you are a newb read my guide I wrote a while ago.

HF's have a maxpain point. There have been several posts about maxpain and what it means is they know there is 100,000 ITM calls, and 100,000 PUTS and they try and manipulate the price to the penny to NOT PAY those that are ITM. In other words, calls over say 27 are ITM and PUTS under 26 are ITM so they park it at 26.50 to fuck both sides. Now sure, some people still win, those who bought really high/low/early but there is a point where MOST people LOSE. That's how they rig the price. They use shorts and buy ITM PUTS (taking a loss) to lower the price right to the cent to bring max pain. Retail doesn't have enough cash to offset this, and they can also use illegal dark pool trading where they only report the sells and not the buys, so it alters the percieved price. It would be like having 500 buys and 200 sells, and only reporting the 200 sells. This is how they manipulate the price to fuck us. Since learning this, I always exit my calls before Friday morning as I always get fucked. Also, institutional traders, day traders, week traders close their positions Friday morning. Now when this happens, all those shares that Market Makers bought to cover, can now liquidate them and do, driving the price further down. At 3pm, all Robinhood's calls expire and they do a massive stock sell dumping the daily price into the red.",,

Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock or determine that it can be borrowed before they sell it short. So naked shorting refers to short pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the market.

Despite being made illegal after the 2008–09 financial crisis, naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems.

I haven't had meth for about 10 years.  I feel like having some now because . . . YOLO . . . but don't know where to get it . . . so at Walmart I see this guy at the parking lot exit with a sign asking for money.  I figure he might know where to get it, but in case he doesn't, I got to give him a fivespot anyway.
