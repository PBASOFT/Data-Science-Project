The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

Bottom line up front, noone knows where this ends, but noone in their right mind thinks AMC or GME as companies are actually worth what they are trading for right now, it's all about the squeeze. You're late to the party, maybe not too late, but you have a lot more to lose than people who bought in at the beginning because your cost basis is way higher. 

In my personal opinion the hedge funds are going to pull some bullshit in the end and retail is going to get screwed, even if that bullshit is just declaring bankruptcy (the bad kind) and leaving the rest of the market holding the bag. In which case yay you ""won"", but you're also not getting shit because the people who were obligated to buy the shares went out of business instead, oh and the market might crash too because it might create a domino effect. If Lehman brothers fell so can Melvin and Citadel.

As far as general market intro and where this might be headed, I recommend watching the movies ""Margin Call"" and ""The Big Short"" for a fun intro that's obviously not that accurate. 

After that it gets harder because you actually need to start reading to learn, investopedia is a good start, and there's a variety of books to read about the market. Stay away from anything promises a get rich trading scheme because it's probably copy paste shit from investopedia mixed in with bad advice. Warren Buffett's book is good, but very TL;DR and is tough to get through if you're just looking for the essentials.",,

Besides that single exception, there is not a single character I am rooting for. I have no emotional investment in the success or failure of any character in the film. They are all garbage. Wildly un-interesting characters.

Speaking of shitty characters, Elvira is the worst. She sucks. Completely unlikeable, no sympathetic qualities. She serves no purpose in the film. The movie would be exactly same- or, maybe, slightly less awful- if she were not in it. She makes the movie *even more* predictable, something I would have otherwise thought to be impossible. 

Which brings me to my next point- it is so boringly, agonizingly predictable. There are no surprises at any moment in this film. It's like watching a rock roll downhill, very slowly, into an unceremonious pile of dog shit. There is no reason for this film to be longer than 45 minutes and yet, somehow, they stretch it to almost three hours. 

The violence/gore is poorly done on such a low level of quality that I'm not sure I have ever seen it done so badly in a major production film. It would be laughable if the rest of the film wasn't even worse. Is it terrible on purpose? Are they trying to make it a joke? These are questions I would ask of the ""special effects"" crew- were you guys trying? Did you really want it to look like this? 

Why do so may of them laugh at their own jokes. Most real-life morons don't even do that, why is it so prevalent in this film. Awful writing, awful script. A 13yr old with a boner and a poor male influence in his life could have written this same movie. 

The easiest critique of it, which I admit is not fair due to the time in which it was made, is that the whole aesthetic of the film is awful. Makes me nauseous. The music, the clothes, the cars, the interior design, all of it is just completely, disgustingly awful. 

Easily one of the most overrated movies ever. If you actually think you like this film then you probably only think you like it because everyone says you should like it. If you *actually do* like this film, then you are completely retarded.",,

608,,2021-05-29 17:40:00,t3_nnsf0j,,wallstreetbets,"Came across an [article](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/04/20625716/3-short-squeeze-candidates-in-the-media-sector) mentioning the high short interest rate in Marcus Corporation, AMC Networks and Digital Media Solutions. Took a look at the fundamentals of the three companies, Marcus Corp. lost $125 million last year and Digital Media also lost money. AMC Networks however made $240 million in 2020 and has a market cap of just $2.2 billion. 

They also have really good momentum with their streaming initiatives and have a target of [9 million subscribers](https://deadline.com/2021/05/amc-networks-q1-softer-revenue-licensing-profit-wall-street-1234751722/) end of 202 and a long term target of 20-25 million subscribers. Discovery has around [13 million subscribers](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/discovery-reaches-15-million-paying-streaming-subscribers-4173688/)but a market cap of almost $16 billion. Thats more than a billion per million subscribers. AMC Networks is trading at a market cap a fraction of that ratio.  Additionally, AMC Networks has a [short interest of 24,8%](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=amcx&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) currently thats higher than even AMC Entertainment (around 21%). 

AMC Networks made hit series like Breaking bad, Mad men, The walking dead and Better call saul with very high IMDB ratings. They seem to produce one hit after another. Some seems to be worried about the end of their current hit series, The Walking Dead. I watched one of their new series this week however; Gangs of London. Think it was pretty good and has an IMDB score of 8.1. 

This week it was announced that Amazon is acquiring [MGM Studios for $8.45 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/amazon-to-buy-mgm-studios-for-8point45-billion.html). There is a lot of consolidation happening in the media sector. With a $2.2 bn market cap of AMC Networks and a library full of hit series, couldn't AMC Networks be a target for acquisition by one of the big players?

I do not really understand why the stock is shorted so heavily. Does anyone have a clue why and maybe someone have an opinion about the company? What do you think about their content?",nnsf0j,AMC Networks - is it a good buying opportunity?

WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS.

Took a look at the fundamentals of the three companies, Marcus Corp. lost $125 million last year and Digital Media also lost money. AMC Networks however made $240 million in 2020 and has a market cap of just $2.2 billion.

They also have really good momentum with their streaming initiatives and have a target of [9 million subscribers](https://deadline.com/2021/05/amc-networks-q1-softer-revenue-licensing-profit-wall-street-1234751722/) end of 202 and a long term target of 20-25 million subscribers. Discovery has around [13 million subscribers](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/discovery-reaches-15-million-paying-streaming-subscribers-4173688/)but a market cap of almost $16 billion. Thats more than a billion per million subscribers. AMC Networks is trading at a market cap a fraction of that ratio. Additionally, AMC Networks has a [short interest of 24,8%](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=amcx&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) currently thats higher than even AMC Entertainment (around 21%).

AMC Networks made hit series like Breaking bad, Mad men, The walking dead and Better call saul with very high IMDB ratings. They seem to produce one hit after another. Some seems to be worried about the end of their current hit series, The Walking Dead. I watched one of their new series this week however; Gangs of London. Think it was pretty good and has an IMDB score of 8.1.

This week it was announced that Amazon is acquiring [MGM Studios for $8.45 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/amazon-to-buy-mgm-studios-for-8point45-billion.html). There is a lot of consolidation happening in the media sector. With a $2.2 bn market cap of AMC Networks and a library with many hits, couldn't AMC Networks be a target for acquisition by one of the bigger players?

I do not really understand why the stock is shorted so heavily. Does anyone have an idea why and maybe someone have an opinion about the company? What do you think about their content?",nnsmac,AMC Networks

Sitting here writing this, I’m getting emotional just thinking about what this could not only do for me but for my children and all the other apes across the world. 

For far to long the little guy has struggled, broken our backs, sweated and cried trying to provide for the people in our lives who are most important to us. 

I’m not going act like my family is hard done by, because we aren’t, we have clothes on our backs and food in the fridge. But everyday is a struggle and worrying about what the one next thing that is going to put me and my family into financial ruins. I live pay cheque to pay cheque, self employed as a single family income. I go to work every day to make sure I can give me kids everything that deserve and then some. 

We now have the power and opportunity to not only change our lives but everyone we know and love. The more I read and see all over Reddit, there could not be a more deserving group of people. People who want to change the world for the better. Not some greedy hedge fund who just care about their bottom line and screwing over the little guy. 

Don’t get me wrong, if amc even did 1/1000th of what everyone is saying. It would be life changing. But that’s not the point. There needs to be change, accountability, shift in the world to take the power from a few and give it back to the people. 

This whole experience has opened my eyes up to a whole new prospective. We all need to hold. Not just about the money, (although I wouldn’t be complaining with seeing some extra 0’s in the bank), we the people need to unite and hold. They have capitalized for far too long. Now it’s our turn!

936,,2021-05-29 17:51:54,t3_nnsnmx,,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis?

Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Technical

Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. 

&#x200B;

Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Operational

With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Business

The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.

&#x200B;

Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. 

&#x200B;

Why Trucking?

Why Trucking: Technical

Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Operational

Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Business

There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). 

&#x200B;

Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.

&#x200B;

In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.

&#x200B;

Why TuSimple? 

The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.

&#x200B;

TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.

&#x200B;

TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. 

&#x200B;

But, but, aren’t they Chinese?

They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? 

&#x200B;

This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.

&#x200B;

Conclusion

Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $8B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. 

&#x200B;

In other words: TSP to the moon, apes!

I am also in amc and gme. But I feel like amc has gotten so much more popular for newer ppl. And I dont get it. Is it the low price? Amc's floor is 100k while gme's is 10 mio. And in my knowledge they both have equal chances of squeezing (maybe even higher for gme). Why are so many ppl interessted in amc while you could make so much more money with gme. 
As I said, I have both stocks and i like them both. But why do newer ppl only go for amc?

The closer to expiration date, the less it’s worth? So if were to buy a $35 call and AMC goes to $40.50 on Friday, then selling my contract would net me $727 in profit? According to conditions I entered? http://opcalc.com/vkh Oh it goes to $15 and basically lose it all. 

So guess best time to enter is with low IV and a further out contract when you expect the price to go up when buying calls?",,
