49,1620568024.0,n8el75,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",165.0,,,

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough. 

Thanks",Capital gains tax period with mergers,91.0,,,
148,1620416868.0,,,,,"I doubt you need to see an accountant.  Most stock for stock mergers in the US are tax-free (which means the holding period doesn't restart) to shareholders, but there are requirements that must be met for tax-free treatment.  There are three ways to figure out whether the acquisition qualified (assuming you are in the US, and the companies are in the US):

\- Easiest - find the press release for the merger, which should say whether the merger will be tax-free for investors).  If it doesn't say, don't assume it will be taxable, but use one of the other ways.

\- Find the tax disclosure in the merger proxy.  Look up the old company on the SEC's website using EDGAR.  Find the DEFM14A, which is the merger proxy.  Search for ""tax"".  There will be a few pages on tax consequences, but best to find the FAQs (usually called ""Question and Answers"") or the comment in the Summary re taxes

\- Send a message to RH and they should be able to tell you when your holding period started

Note, any cash received would most likely be taxable. 

An example of a merger proxy is here:

149,1620415098.0,,,,,"You should be able to just look at your capital gains/losses to-date.  They (the broker) have to specify for tax purposes whether the capital gain or loss of any transaction is short term or long term.   I'm no longer on Robinhood so I'm not sure if you can just look that up or if you have to request your paperwork with them.  If you see that your shares are not showing as long-term, that's Robinhood's problem, as they are required to give you accurate data for tax purposes.  Bring it up with them if there's a problem.  I know I can look at all of my gains/losses broken into short and long term at any time with my current broker.   A merger or other ticker change does not change your date of purchase or cost basis.  Note:  I have not experienced this first-hand, so of course consult a tax professional if your gains still show as short term (assuming you even sold them and the issue comes up).",gxb3aux,t3_n75o8q
150,1620414456.0,,,,,"Assume you're in the US? I think what you're saying is you're trying to avoid SHORT TERM cap gains right? My impression is that a merger shouldn't affect that - your cost basis and holding period should remain. I'd get advice on this from a tax professional however first.

151,1620417755.0,,,,,"You're good.

No capital gains, until you sell the new stock. I've had this happen to me several times before. 

The catch is if it is a cash to shareholders or partial cash to shareholds in the transaction, you will have to pay capital gains on the cash. If it is less then a year short-term gains rules apply.

This isn't uncommon as the buying company only gives even unsplit shares out and the pricing dictated some people ended up with 5.33 shares. The company might give you 5 shares of the new stock and the value of 0.33 shares in cash. You would then have capitol gains on that cash.

&#x200B;

The safest way to check is post-merge check your brokerage account. There will be a section that is called something along the line of ""Realized Gain/Loss"" and you can see your list of gains and losses taken for the year as they occur. You might need to be on the website version of your brokerage account access.

I can see where I had a cash gain due to these partial shares being paid in cash right now in my account in 2020.

In 2020, I had another stock sold to another company that was an all-cash offer, and I had to take capital gains on the year that buy-out of the company happened. 

It will also show you if you had a holding go completely bankrupt and was completely devalued. You can't control when you take that loss, unless you sell it in advance.

&#x200B;

Another scenario, it can also show you. Slightly more complex. I owned Yahoo a few years ago. They old off assets from their primary company, but they also owned stocks in other companies. The biggest was Alibaba. When Yahoo went out of business the stock turned into a holding company with no long-term intention to be an investment company. Over time they sold off their assets and gave shareholders cash directly. I can't control when they distribute that cash, but I pay capitol gains on that in the year they pay me. Oddly enough, these things can take years sometimes and it can become hard to sell off these companies when they are no longer listed in a stock exchange and they become smaller. I usually try to get out of these companies before they get to that point.",gxb90fl,t3_n75o8q

164,1620416370.0,,,,,"Hey everyone, new investor with <500 put into my RH acc so far. I have a question about ETF’s & Crypto. From what i’ve learned it seems that diversification works well for someone looking to grow their money over a long period of time. Because of that I put my money into 8 different etf’s a couple weeks ago. Last week, i dove a little deeper into crypto and found ethereum. Seems like a pretty safe bet long term to either break even or sky like bitcoin, so i added some to my portfolio. Recently I read that it’s basically pointless to have so many etfs because of inevitable overlapping, so i’m down to 5 etf’s and eth. My splits are: VTI-20%, VOO-20%, VTG-20%, ETH-20%, MSOS-10%, VONG-10%. Is this a decent plan?

So I setup a Robinhood account last night and I linked it to my bank and put money into my Robinhood account. I got a free stock and I put some money into dogecoin. So my questions are

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.

181,1620308797.0,,,,,"If you are on a (free) cash account, it is impossible that you will owe money, as you will only be able to use what you deposit (buying power), you can only buy what you have the available buying power for and whatever you buy can only go to $0, not negative.

If you are on an (free) instant account, when you start a transfer to Roninhood, they make the $ amount instantly available to you for trading, even though it hasn't been withdrawn from your bank yet. So the only way you can owe money is if you start a transfer but it gets returned insufficient funds from your bank, and they will reverse the transfer.

On both free accounts, interest isn't paid, its earned. I have a 0.3% interest rate (be aware that is zero point three percent, as in less than 1 percent, not 30 percent), and you will accrue interest monthly on any cash in your Robinhood portfolio. 

Only when you start borrowing money from them can you end up owing money, and even then, unless you literally are spending money you KNOW you don't have, it will be difficult to go in the negative.",gx5e3iq,t3_n677o1

You should see something called Margin Investing - check and ensure that it’s disabled. If you enable Margin Investing, you’re essentially trading on borrowed funds, where you’ll owe 2.5% flat interest rate on anything above $1000. 

You could end up owing money in two ways:

1. If you have margin enabled, where you trade on borrowed money and you don’t profit and end up owing RH money. If this happens, you’ll get a “margin call” to make up for the funds. 
2. If you play with some sophisticated options like credit spreads, which may not go your way.

A. You will never owe money from your loses - should you decide to sell your investment back at a lower price.

B. If you sell your stock, or crypto at a higher price in which you get a profit, you will owe taxes on what you earned as a ""short term capitol gain"". (Example, your investment from 10 dollars went to 20, and you sold. You will owe taxes on the 10 dollars earned)

Plus, just think about the price of the stock itself. It goes down when lots of people sell it, but people have to own the stock before they can sell it, so you can typically keep an eye on stuff like that based on the numbers, rumors, etc. You can get a somewhat decent idea of the risk level of a selloff when buying a call. However, a stock goes up when people are buying, and you have no way of knowing when someone out there is about to make a massive purchase that is going to drive the price up, or when the company is going to make an announcement that will cause a buying frenzy, etc. all of which can come out of nowhere and completely screws you over if you have a put.

How does one payback the margin used? I searched on the app but there is no explanation on my question. 

Any advice would help.",Messing with Margin and now I have questions,108.0,,,
252,1620246977.0,,,,,Sell things or deposit money.,gx2jwj0,t3_n5pl3t
253,1620252892.0,,,,,"Margin is basically a line of credit based on the equity in your account.

The way you pay it back is deposit more money or sell so that you place cash back into your account, if you are running on margin the cash will go against your margin. Keep in mind last time I checked the margin rates for robinhood they were about 2% and they gave you $1000 that doesn't accumulate interest.

So you can run $1000 into margin and not be charged any monthly interest. You will pay their $5 for robinhood gold, but it's worth it IMO.",gx2xnnh,t3_n5pl3t

258,1620754757.0,,,,,"So I’m in the same boat, but in order to sell my shares I need to buy back my covered calls. It won’t let me do that though due to deficit. It feels like a catch 22. I need to sell my shares to pay off the margin but I can’t sell them do to the covered calls.",gxr5byl,t3_n5pl3t
259,1620309950.0,,,,,Margin is def higher risk. Gotta proceed carefully.,gx5gkvn,t3_n5pl3t
260,1620259846.0,,,,,"This.

You need the amount available to cover the margin you borrowed before you can turn it off.

So, let's say you have $1000 margin invested and $500 in cash. You need to sell $500 so that you have $1000 ""in cash"" before you can turn margin off.

Once it's off, you'll have $0 in cash because you paid back the margin (and $500 left invested).

261,1620256573.0,,,,,"Yeah 2% is an awesome deal. And that 1k free means that $2,000 costs you 1% 

As long as you can easily pay it back, there is no reason to not use that money.

I think it’s 2.5%, still great though.",gx35iny,t1_gx2xnnh
262,1620265825.0,,,,,But then why use margin at all? It’s supposed to give you more buying power but if you have cash on hand you don’t need the added risk,gx3ohvl,t1_gx375b8

265,1620274397.0,,,,,"A common view of the “safe” way to use margin is sort of like an extended version of RH’s instant deposit. You want to enter a position (option or stock) but need to deposit more? Use margin to get in the position you want while you wait for a deposit to process. 

Of course you *can* just use it as extra funds for a fee, and I’ll admit I do that too, but there’s a view that that can be dangerous but even moreso wasteful because of the interest if you do it long term. 

Granted I’m on TDA now so my interest is like 10% or something, which is a bigger hit than robinhood’s apparently amazing rate.",gx445hy,t1_gx3ohvl
266,1620309525.0,,,,,[removed],gx5fnyq,t1_gx3ohvl
267,1620257831.0,,,,,A margin call? There's no timeline defined by regulators before liquidation but you'll have time to make a transfer or liquidate on your own in most cases. Margin in general? Only if margin requirements change (results in a margin call) would you need to 'pay anything back' or whenever you want to downgrade from having margin extended to you.,gx38688,t1_gx373p8
268,1620260005.0,,,,,"They like you to pay right away. If you wait longer than 1 trading day, they'll put you in the doghouse (cant open positions until margin call is settled), if you wait longer they might automatically sell some of your stocks to cover your margin call.",gx3cn56,t1_gx373p8
269,1620272839.0,,,,,They can liquidate your holdings with zero heads up to you or opportunity to pay it back.,gx41m2n,t1_gx373p8
270,1620295758.0,,,,,"Correct.  Margin allows you to get in and out of each position  instantly.  Some ETFs have over 24 hours to clear and if you sell a position, it can take several days for your funds to be available.  If you need to deposit money, it usually takes a few days as well.  Margin allows you to snap stuff up quickly.",gx4tj47,t1_gx445hy
271,1620310698.0,,,,,">sell cash secured puts

You really think that's good advice to someone asking the questions op is here with? Dude hasn't even figured out how to use the internet yet and you're telling them to hop into options.",gx5i8gv,t1_gx5fnyq
272,1620275451.0,,,,,"Sorry for the long read. I’m pretty sure I’ll just take care of it. I just can’t take any weird unexpected hits right now. Which is why I’ll just make sure it’s cleared. But I’m not 100% sure in what’s happening. I don’t think I’ve borrowed money. Just a slight mis lapse in. Funds deposited and the message says “make sure you have x amount by this date” 

And yes I’m still typing. Shutting up now. Lol",gx45r8m,t1_gx38688
273,1620274704.0,,,,,"Sorry I may have mis spoke. I’m not sure I’m on margin I do have gold and just learned of the instant transfer sort of thing. I’m only behind like 20-15$ eso since I I got till Monday and another 15$ coming in tomorrow which should make me flush.. Yeah im sure I’ll have plenty more of that in buying power. I was just wonder IF. IF.  The worst was to happen. And I am short? what if? I already don’t want to know and will probably take care of it. I just don’t want them liquidating one of my positions. ESP over such small pennies. If they do I mine as well use the whole 5k lot. Jk. That’s bad thinking I don’t wanna be in any hole after climbing out of one that took 10yrs. 

(TL:DR- what if I’m short on a 550$ money transfer where I got to use the funds but I really got 565-570$. And I don’t have that extra15-20$? I’m sure I will. But for future knowledge on possible bigger things like this. Would greatly appreciate info)",gx44ml5,t1_gx38688

Let's say your bank account is:

XXXX XXXX XXXX 1234

You're saying your new debit card issued by your bank is also:

284,1620226653.0,,,,,"I don't think that's what he means. I think he is saying his debit card numbers changed but his checking account number is the same. He is basically saying do they pull the money from the checking account or the debit card.

330,1620173733.0,,,,,Short term rates are subject to normal income ranges so if you make less than 10k in total income for the year then you won’t be taxed.  Long term gains aren’t taxed if you make less than 40k per year.,gwyulxf,t1_gwyafvn
331,1620099796.0,n4f7ns,"I apologize if this is a noobish question, but it’s one that I don’t think I’ve seen an answer to.",Is it possible to have a negative account balance when trading options without exercising a contract?,103.0,,,
332,1620131632.0,,,,,As long as you aren’t writing any options (making you the party responsible for taking the loss from an ITM option) then the lowest you should be able to go is 0. Unless you’re using margin of course.,gwwdxri,t3_n4f7ns
333,1620129252.0,,,,,"If you are long options with no leverage, no. If you are short options uncovered, or if you use leverage, yes. There are some cases where your broker will liquidate your position automatically if you suffer sufficient losses on short or leveraged positions, in which case you will need to repay any shortfall in the account. 

One example:
You deposit $5,000 into your account, then purchase $8,000 of weekly in the money calls using robinhood gold. The underlying drops 20% during the holding period and the options expire worthless. Robinhood will either have liquidated the position once the value dropped sufficiently, or an hour before expiration on the expiration date. You now owe robinhood $3,000. 

If you are not intimately familiar with the mechanics of options I would strongly suggest not trading them.",gww9xaz,t3_n4f7ns
334,1620125047.0,,,,,If just buying calls or puts yes you can only lose premium.,gww3xmw,t3_n4f7ns
335,1620138393.0,,,,,"No. Apart from what it means to exercise an option, the first thing to understand is the ability to exercise a contract is available only for option buyers - not option sellers. When you buy an option you 'own' the rights within the contract. This is not true for option sellers. The selling party has sold the rights within the contract and therefore cannot exercise those rights (since they do not own them).

The second thing to understand is that when you buy options, you cannot lose more than the price of the option itself. In other words, your maximum loss is whatever you paid for the option.

Let's put these ideas together. When you use the language ""without exercising a contract"" by definition you are referring to option buyers. As a buyer, then, the lowest value of your option contracts, at expiration for example, is 0. 

Hope that helps

(It may be illuminating to note that exercising options is not typical for most traders)",gwws1vq,t3_n4f7ns

338,1620143682.0,,,,,As long as you're not trading on margin you shouldn't have a negative account. Trading on margin is when you trade with borrowed money. DO NOT DO THAT.  For options the most you can lose is what ever the price of the option was.,gwx4y14,t3_n4f7ns

350,1620079517.0,,,,,Wash sale is sell for a \_loss\_ and buy back within 30 days actually.   You can sell at a profit all you want (and yes the gains are based on how long you held).  The Wash Sale Rule exists to prevent  gaming your realized \_losses\_.,gwu3ky4,t1_gwtyzpp

353,1620062993.0,,,,,I think the asking price is the minimum a seller of a stock would accept.. and the Bid is the most a buyer would pay for the said stock... the Bid-Ask spread is the difference between those two numbers.. the smaller the spread is the more liquidity the stock or option has and the larger the spread the less liquidity..

355,1620072787.0,,,,,I think a lack of understanding of the bid/ask is one of the most common issues I see when people new to options ask questions.

If I place a sell at .39 it moves the entire spread from .39 ask and the bid moves up. The price of the option then moves down from .37 to .36 then up to .38 and the spread then changes to .36 bid to .41 ask - what’s going on here??!",gwu2jyu,t3_n41ivh

358,1620085009.0,,,,,"The best way to think of this is to imagine the NYSE 100
Years ago.  You have a room full of buyers and sellers all yelling over each other to either buy at the lowest possible or sell at the highest.  Within this, buyers are trying to outbid each other while sellers are trying to undercut each other, depending on their determination or necessity to sell and buy.  This is where the bid- ask spread comes from.  This is also why the more people participating in the trading of a stock, the closer the bid/ask of that underlying becomes.  Market makers are essentially doing this in real time.  This is also why, although virtually all trading is done on a computer, we still operate by the same market hours we always have.  Without the most people possible participating in the market at the same time, prices can become unclear and you very likely will get ripped off.",gwuf7g5,t3_n41ivh

361,1620085282.0,,,,,"While I agree you should understand where the bid ask comes from, it’s shouldn’t prevent you from trading options.  Start above the mid and work your way down until you get filled.  If your looking to get filled quickly start below the mid.  Whether or not the debit/ credit is worth the option you’re trading is always subjective to that person",gwufs24,t1_gwtodm5
362,1620087488.0,,,,,"Need more info. The open interest isn’t as important as the volume on the day and the number of contracts you are trading. Once your sell order fills, the bid will go to whatever bids are out there. Spreads on options are totally different than stocks. If you’re trading something that has limited volume, the spread will be wide AF",gwukdjk,t1_gwu2jyu
363,1620102019.0,,,,,I think some traders use bots or automatic api connection to automatically match the lowest ask. I noticed when I went from $1.80 a contract all the way to $.30 a contract and the same 18 contracts kept following my price change instantly. If I don’t see them follow I cancel my order and boom the 18 contracts were $.05 above my price,gwvc63d,t1_gwu2jyu
364,1620102142.0,,,,,Also your example to me is more that the price will always average out between the bid and ask so when the new ask is lower that the last the price will be even lower than that due to averaging out between the bid and the ask,gwvcd9l,t1_gwu2jyu
365,1620092830.0,,,,,And I have $2.30 in my checking account but transfered $1000 to Robinhood. Is that a problem and why is Robinhood at fault?,gwuvdwc,t1_gwu0a9c

371,1620063810.0,,,,," Hello, I have never had a job or needed to pay taxes so I have very little idea of how to do it in general. 

I have bought and sold cryptocurrency in around $100-$150 increments, 12 total transactions counting buying and selling on robinhood and made maybe $5 at most in the past few days. I was just bored sitting on my phone buying and selling as it went up and down a few cents, I did not do enough research and just did not think about it from a tax perspective.

I know it seems petty but I am concerned about what that will do to me tax wise as I assume I will now have to file for the first time and for such a small amount earned. 

Do I only pay taxes on the $5 earned, or will I have to pay some for each of the transactions?",gwt38dk,t3_n3sdik

380,1620009621.0,n3m2d0,"I'm in my 50s and just found out I have cancer. I started investing for the first time ever in March. Through trial and error, I'm up $1,700 based on an initial investment of $6k. I'll probably have to pay short-term tax because I did some version of day trading...holding onto stocks for a couple of days then selling. This isn't about taxes, though.   


When should I take out profit so that I recoup my initial investment and am only working with profit? I'm in Eth, BTC, QQQ. I'm also in Apple which I'm going to dump in favor of VTI ETh is soaring, but will likely drop. Should I take out the profit from it -  $760 - then start from scratch with it? I'm tempted to liquidate it all and put it in VTI, let it grow safely, then make another lump sum investment. I'm fine, for now.",When do you take out profits?,50.0,,,
381,1620016558.0,,,,,"I do apologize for the cancer, I hope it can be cured. 

The right time to finish a position and take a profit is subjective. What you shouldn't do is get greedy. Greed has taken many users for their wealth on this sub. Any profit is good profit.

One other note is that you should invest to build wealth not to pay for cancer.
This is purely an example, suppose your treatment costs $1000 and you have all of your capital in one investment. You make a good trade and it increases in value to 900. You wait until it reaches $1000. But then it decreases in value to 700 and never reaches 900 again. 

Of course uee your profits to pay for cancer or whatever esle you need but use logic when trading.",gwqx2xx,t3_n3m2d0
382,1620019735.0,,,,,"Set a goal for yourself based on your plan and purpose for investing. Include a low and high growth goal. 

50% sell when you hit your low goal. 
30% sell when you hit your high goal. 
20% to hold on longer if you feel like it will keep going up, or can be sold at the high goal. 

This is assuming that you are solely looking for profits and are not looking to stay in a stock long term. 

Play around with those numbers based on what you feel. 

Before you buy anything, know why you’re buying it and what your exit strategy is.",gwr1ajf,t3_n3m2d0
383,1620019886.0,,,,,"I take out at 5% to 200% so really it’s up to you. I also own Nvidia and it’s sitting at 300% return, I’m not selling that for at least 10 years for example.

I just ask myself, do I feel this will continue going up based on x, y and z info and my overall opinion on a company or investment. In a bull market it’s hard because most the time just leaving it sitting will gain more. However, in the same time doing swing trades 5-15% makes more over a year so those ones are great.

Also, I wish I learned this before but short term tax rate is the same as ordinary income tax based on what you make. I was all afraid to short term trade, fearing a tax bill but it doesn’t freaking matter. Just pay your dues and move on. I treat it as a job so thus taxed like one. If I got a few million a year in income then I’ll care.",gwr1he7,t3_n3m2d0
384,1620141811.0,,,,,"Re: Taxes, ideally try to cash out when long-term capital gains tax applies rather than short-term unless it's a tax exempt account. As for an exit strategy, that's really something you need to figure out on your own and then just commit to. It sounds like you want to take out your initial investment, are you comfortable doing that now, or are you hoping to utilize it to make more profit before taking it out? When I make an investment I commit to not needing that money again for a long time. When I take profits I never really take profits, I exit a position at a profit and then roll that into a new investment. Being in your 50s it makes sense that you might be more on the side of things where you're looking to cash out some of the profits and use them. This is really the kind of situation where talking to a CPA is of use and you should consider it, there are even some resources (e.g. local colleges) that can set you up with a free consultation with a CPA.  
This is not financial advice.",gwx0cmv,t3_n3m2d0
385,1620062016.0,,,,,talk to your tax professional but I am also in my 50s and play in my ROTH IRA tax free growth.     what Ive been doing and works for me is I started out  buying  aprox $500 of a stock.  when it was up 20% or more I sell about $500 worth of shares and let the house money ride.  I would invest in another stock or wait till a dip in same stock and buy and sell it over and over again.   Now ive done that for a while  I now take out  investment plus 10 or 20% and then let house money ride.  im up about 40% for year so far,gwsyxrb,t3_n3m2d0
386,1620016368.0,,,,,I would stay away from crypto for short term trading. I know more about long term investing than short term trading. So I can’t help more than that,gwqwt1e,t3_n3m2d0
387,1620353473.0,,,,,Get the book Chris beat cancer!  My father is battling it and he speaks of all kinds of things mostly what we eat and how he beat it. There’s a lot of similar testimonies of stage IV survivors. Good luck!,gx86pvo,t3_n3m2d0
388,1620105345.0,,,,,"Great advice. I appreciate it. To your point, I have Eth right now. It's really going through the roof. If I sold right now, I'd have a profit of $1,100. I've only had a few weeks meaning I'd have to deduct a large chunk - 37 percent - for taxes. But I take your point about being greedy. I feel like cashing out right now, or perhaps selling a limit order to sell when it reaches a certain point - say $800",gwvh52y,t1_gwqx2xx

I have been trying to learn about investing, stocks, crypto etc for a few months now by reading and watching YouTube videos. The truth is I'm still pretty overwhelmed and confused by it all. It also doesn't help that I hate numbers lol

Anyway, I decided to ""just do it""  about 3 weeks ago and started with $500 on Robinhood. I have 4 free stocks so far and got 3.11 GE, 0.0298 AMZN, 2 BUZZ, 1 NIO, and 266 DOGE. I definitely don't know what I am doing but I want to invest more. $500 more or maybe 1k. I know that I want VTI or VOO also.

I know and understand that most people on here are not financial advisors and I know that it is up to me to do my own research BUT I am coming to you all anyway to ask for your help/advice. People are a wealth of information on this app. 

So if you were me, a beginner, with $1000 to invest today, what would you do? Thank you all in advance and I welcome any questions you may have.

EDIT: Wow!!! Thank you all for your responses and information. I've learned a lot of new terminology that I hadn't come across previously, so I am going to look into those as well. I have a good starting point for next steps and have some important questions to answer for myself. THANK YOU!!",HELP THIS NEWBIE INVEST $1000,301.0,,,
423,1619980436.0,,,,,"You are taking a logical approach.  Start with a small amount of money and try.  For long term conservative holding, most people buy the big index ETFs that mirror the market as a whole, such as an S&P 500 ETF.  If you are looking to pick and choose individual stocks, buying and selling with any frequency, then proceed with caution.  Try to diversify across industries to reduce risk.  Big bets on a single company can end well, go badly, or go nowhere.  Best of luck to you.",gwp145i,t3_n3c5ze

The market sentiment right now is really volatile, arguably entering into a bear market. If you wanna go the safe route, start dumping money into $QQQ or $VOO, even $SPY.

431,1620003608.0,,,,,"Depends on your risk tolerance. I’m going to assume since you have a substantial savings yet only invested $500 you are either skeptical about stocks or full of shit. I’ll assume the former and we can infer low risk is what you’re looking for at this time due to small starting position. My suggestion is look into “Boomer” stocks. These are stocks like coca-cola, Ford, AT&T, and GE. You won’t see much growth but they have been around forever and can protect your wealth by always being around. If you aren’t so sure about managing your own stocks, valuations, or intrinsic value I’d suggest starting with mutual funds or ETF’s (exchange traded funds). Most mutual funds require a minimum purchase, can only purchase at a set time of day (regardless if it’s the best value for the stocks involved), they are managed by a person or persons, they invest in multiple stocks at once, and have fees with no guarantee of progress. ETF’s are traded on the stock market like stock, they invest in multiple stocks chosen by a person or computer algorithm, the time of purchase is the same time as market hours, they have little to no fee, some ETF’s use leverage which can be dangerous, and generally ETF’s based on indexes are the safest. ETF’s based on index’s like $SPY or $VOO or $QQQ are safe bets. This is since the market established in the late 1800’s it’s had growth. $SPY has an average growth rate of 8% since inception. If you are nearing retirement you might want to lower your risk by moving out of stock positions and into bonds. Both of these markets reflect one another. For specific stock recommendations you should speak with a financial advisor considering your experience level and available funds an advisor would help greatly. Lastly a ROTH IRA can help grow your wealth with stocks. Downsides are you can only invest $6k a year and you can’t take out until your retirement age. The pro’s will tell you put all of your $1000 into one investment because you wouldn’t choose a bad stock to invest in and diversified portfolios are for idiots. I will say I’m not a trading genius so my dumbass has a portfolio diversified over multiple sectors using individual stocks, cryptos, and ETF’s. Lastly this info mainly applies to U.S. citizens trading on the NYSE.

432,1620018924.0,,,,,"Remember that investing requires patience, real investing takes years, really decades, that way compound interest can work its magic. You have plenty of time as long as you don't waste 1p years trying to ""get rich quick""  It also requires cool-headedness. When people are panicking you are looking for buying opportunities, when people are riding high on a single stock, you continue to diversify.

Invest in companies you believe in for the long term, hold on for the ride and add when you beliefs are stronger than ever. Look at market Cap to determine a company's size. Individual share price does not matter, especially with fractional shares available now. Market cap = price per share × total # of shares.

There’s always that point where you need to dump and run with a loss or a gain. So get to know the highs and lows of the companies you like. You can’t rely on quarterly reports now a days.

If you can’t bear to lose this money, then if suggest putting it in some blue chip stocks that’ll have a hard time tanking like SQ, FB, AAPL, PYPL, etc. These stocks might fluctuate a bit more than an index, and are all tech so there’s no diversity, but they have a decently high chance of steadily going up as well. If you plan to continue adding money to this like a retirement fund then you can buy VOO, VTI, SPY, etc, but if this $1000 is for you to  actively trade, then find some stocks you believe in and get your feet wet. $1000 isn’t going to get you far gains wise unless you mess with options, and that very well may be what you do if this is fun money and you don’t care if it disappears.

442,1620059039.0,,,,,"When I pick a stock, and I’m not an expert either, I have gotten to the decision based on a tiny bit of randomness and mostly research. I joined a bunch of relevant subreddits and will watch the stocks being talked about - not to necessarily buy, but to be able to start picking. Otherwise it’s like letter soup right? Easier to have suggestions and go look them all up from there. Also I try to pay attention to things I like - a year ago AMC was struggling and experts thought they might go broke. AMC is what I’d consider the best chain in the US and I love going to the movies. Even though I’m high risk and can’t get to the movies still for a while, they’re wonderful. I put a little money in there... and over time more and sold some and did it again. I still have like 11 shares I may just never sell at this rate haha. I also love Disney and in spite of them having similar issues, dumped a bit into them too. With excellent results. Anyway my point is you can think about what you normally do or need and where YOU spend money to get inspiration for stocks to check out and possibly buy into. If you’re not into tech but recognize that it’s an area with lots of potential, do your research on ETFs or simply go for long term S&P stuff. You’re likely to trend up if you spread out your money across things that naturally tend to trend up anyway. 

Oh and, if something isn’t performing well, you will need to recognize when to cut losses and when to wait. If it’s a long term investment, hold it, but if you had a shorter term in mind and are down a small percent but want to put money into some other thing, taking a small loss for (hopefully) a decent gain is actually smart. You want your money to work for you.",gwsrwae,t3_n3c5ze
443,1620060127.0,,,,,"VOO. You get 80% of the U.S. economy, crazy low fees. If VOO goes down, Congress jumps into action to get it back up. It's not like Tesla or any individual company which could go bankrupt and no one would miss it.

Also keep $5 free to do reverse split arbitrage. Sometimes a company will announce that 10 shares will now be consolidated into 1 share, which has the effect of increasing the price per share about 10x. (The exact ratio may differ.) So if you had 10 shares before the split, you'd now have 1 share that's worth ten times as much. That's a reverse split.

If you only had 1 share going in, you'd have 1/10 of a share after, a fraction which historically could not be traded. To get around fractional shares, companies will sometimes pay you the cash value of the fractional share. Other times, though, they will round you up to one full share. When they round up, the share you had bought for $0.50 is now worth around $5. You profit $4.50 with almost no risk.

I post these on Twitter (google it), just follow and turn on notifications. It's a super low risk way to make an extra $10 or $20 a month and get your feet wet trading.",gwsugc3,t3_n3c5ze

This counts as the core of your long-term strategy and should effect what choices you make in your taxable account. The next question is how much time will you spend monitoring your investments. This effects what kind of strategies you will want to employ. You also need to determine how much risk you are willing to take. 

Do some reading on different strategies; pick one that sounds like it will fit. Which one doesn't really matter. There are tons of ways to make money in the market, each different strategy will work better in different market environments. Put a small amount of money in and practice.

485,1619982930.0,,,,,"Everyone has their own strategy and yours is fine. Here's how I look at it. 

With bull puts I don't think much about the stock going higher. I look for ones that I don't think will go lower. So imo Ebay is a good pick. 

Also, because I'm not looking for it to go up, I sell weeklies. Less time for it to go bad, faster time decay.

Then I focus on the break-even point I want. I look at the second lowest resistance level and see if I can find a risk/profit balance around that. With Ebay first resistance is around 55.30, second is about 54.88.

When it comes to picking strikes, I like both to be out-of-the-money with a few strikes between them. The larger spread gives you a lower profit %, but it makes the profit/loss slope longer, giving you more time to decide when to bail if it starts going bad. 

So for Ebay, I would be inclined to pick something like May 7th 55.50/51.50. With the chart I'm looking at that would be max gain 0.53, max loss 3.47. Break even at 54.97. But the profit of 15.27% is a bit low for me so I probably wouldn't do it. 

If I base it off your expected break-even of 55.10, then I would probably pick May 7 55.5/54. BE @ 55.12, 33.93% profit, max profit 0.35, max loss 1.12, probability of profit 60%. Then I'd sell 14 pairs for a credit of 490.

Again this is my current personal way of picking bull credit spreads. It's quite conservative and short-term. In this case Ebay doesn't quite fit my criteria, but it's close and maybe going out two more weeks would make it look better, but I thought it would be helpful to walk through my thought process. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how to pick your spreads with more confidence. 

Final thoughts - see what the sentiment is Monday and if it looks like it hit resistance. Also take a look at more expensive tickers so you don't have to sell as many to get a decent return amount.",gwp7424,t3_n3b99t

""The main difference between a [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) violation and free riding is the eventual deposit of funds to cover the buy. In free riding the buyer sells the security without ever depositing the funds to pay for the initial purchase.

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) considers a good faith violation an ""abuse of credit"" and requires the broker keep track of them. If the trader gets three violations in one year, the broker is required to restrict the account.

695,1619846111.0,,,,,I think you're mixing up buying power with settled funds. Anyone on cash account will get the buying power from a sale instantly but the funds aren't technically settled until T+2,gwifhgi,t1_gwfm53k
696,1619819745.0,,,,,Then that is considered a margin account.  Robinhood defaults all accounts as margin accounts unless you specify you want a cash account.,gwh4hnz,t1_gwfohyy

701,1619880280.0,,,,,"Yeah I just figured OP is using a cash account, so I can't see how he'd even be able to commit freeriding, but he definitely could commit a good faith violation.",gwjmzsy,t1_gwhl9fj
702,1619814011.0,,,,,"Idk why it's that number specifically, but I'd assume that someone who has $25k laying around to invest has the money to cover if something goes wrong. Or it's to keep us poor people from trading like the whales do.",gwgsh8u,t1_gwgmxmb
703,1619848166.0,,,,,"When I first started trading I was upset by the 25k thing as I sat and watched multiple/different tickers jump 30% in a day, going “look how much I could make if I was able to jump in on just 10% of the run 5 times instead of 3 each week, or even 20 times. Boo no fair”. However, for the poorer investors like myself we struggle with not being greedy and wanting 15% or more. And we miss the the top and it drops quicker than we think it will and oh snap I’m DOWN 10% bail! Then a few minutes later it’s going back up and we jump back in to try to ride it again, but wait it was false. Down another 10%. The ticker is still up 10% on the day, which is good for anyone who was in before the day. But you’re down 20%. Dodge is a great example. I like dodge and do believe it is just getting started. However; on your next day off, take X amount of money you feel like flushing down the toilet, and try to make 40% on the day just jumping in and out in and out. Most likely, you might break even but probably not. It helps us poor guys more than we know. Just my 2 cents. Now why that rule is in place? Idk but I’m personally okay with it.",gwii338,t1_gwgmxmb
704,1619815085.0,,,,,"There are good reasons for the trading and settlement rules, but they are complex and can wipe you out if you don’t understand them. The 25k thing is arbitrary, but intended to result in fewer uninformed spectators being wiped out. Not sure it functions as intended though. You could replace it with a detailed licensing exam required to open an account, but that would severely impact business. So instead you can do stupid stuff freely, as long as you’ve got enough money for it to be worth the brokers time to field your confused calls.",gwguqc4,t1_gwgsh8u
705,1619819883.0,,,,,The 25k was set up so people who are day trading have enough funds theoretically that they are not using there diaper money to trade.,gwh4s0j,t1_gwgsh8u

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

Not sure what’s worse, me missing out on that extra $70 in easy money, or watching whoever bought the options miss out on $30 of it (and counting) by sleeping on rise as the stock continues to slide. 

With my luck they’ll fail to execute the option at all and it’ll slide back below $4.5.

748,1619679124.0,n0ypiz,"I am fine creating stop loss/limit orders on stocks and one-leg options but get confused setting stop loss/limit orders on credit and debit spreads on RH. I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

A nice safe stock will get you a 10% rate of return to get you to $100K in 46 years. I'm assuming you have a much faster target time frame. That means higher return and that means much higher risk.


So I'll assume you're looking for at least a 20X if not 50X or 100X return in 1-2 years.

Dogecoin, on average in April, had a price in pennies according to the day of April. Roughly speaking it was 5 cents on the 5th, was 20 cents on the 20th, was 30 cents today.  A 30X return since Jan 1, 2021.  It's probably exactly the gamble you're looking for. Big risk, big reward.

788,1619638866.0,n0mz1n,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part— Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won’t. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I’m tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren’t required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone’s advice works and I get my money back, I’d be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that’s legal. 

tl:dr I believe Robinhood violated my rights when it sold my crypto after the order officially cancelled and restored to my account, and do not know how to proceed",Securities Sold without Permission,21.0,,,

Even if it was, crypto isn’t a security in the first place so you can’t claim to the SEC that they somehow violated a matter of securities ownership. And lastly, when you buy crypto on Robinhood, you don’t actually own the coins, you own a fraction of a pool of coins in a larger wallet. I hate to say this, but I think you have to take the L and learn the lesson: if you want control over your securities/crypto, you need to own it, and Robinhood isn’t the place to own either because neither ever become yours when you trade on their platform.

Think about it. As a business owner, you don’t buy into a business and hold it for 6 months to a year to potentially sell it down the road for a profit. You buy into a business to potentially make profits on a consistent monthly or quarterly basis  it’s just ironic to me these insiders are getting rich and not sharing part of that wealth with the investors that allowed it to happen.

817,1619636055.0,,,,,"You clearly lack education in regards to business management, finance, and macro economics. 

Business owners regularly forego taking any form of compensation in the interest of the business they operate. As the holder of a non-dividend stock you are effectively that type of owner. Contingencies on holding that share are the board or whoever is tasked with handling the business finance get to make that decision for you. 

If all stocks paid divdends it would normalize share prices, PEs would converge, and prospecting/speculating would be at least inhibited if not impossible. This would likely hinder innovation and stagnate the financial markets. 

If you think there is only value in receiving a dividend, only invest in companies with a stable dividend. 

It is entirely rational, and even ethical, for the end goal of a corporation to not be dividend distribution. In fact, paying a dividend is a strategy to retain shareholders when innovation and growth have stagnated but the company is cash positive. Basically you have all this cash and nothing left to justifiably (or unjustifiably) spend it on; wages are competitive or even industry leading (or at least employee retention is good) so you distribute it to the shareholders. 

Shareholders get paid last almost always. Companies which are not cash positive but continue to pay a dividend have decided to ski a slippery slope that ends in bankruptcy.",gw7dxqe,t3_n0jx5i
818,1619648868.0,,,,,"I agree with a lot of what is said here but let me go a bit more in-depth:

You start a business with some savings you have. You are going from nothing to HOPEFULLY something, but at the beginning you are (hopefully) pumping all of your money back into the company and not taking pay (because you have to innovate, advertise, scale, build inventory, etc.). 

At some point you become somewhat successful but you still aren’t taking any pay, and the company still isn’t turning a profit. You really need investors to help you scale faster and faster and hit critical mass to where you are cash flow positive. You find a VC that loves your company and they give you $$$ for, say, 20% of the company. 

So the VC works with you and you scale and become cash flow positive and now you can afford to pay yourself a small salary but the VC still doesn’t take any money out. At some point you and the VC want to go public to allow investors to buy shares and for you to cash out some from your hard work. You go public, your company trades on the market, and you are happy. 

Nothing has changed. Instead of you and the VC being the only owners, you now have millions of owners. The company is still growing however. Now that you are public ally traded your have a fiduciary duty to manage the firm to the best benefit of your shareholders. As a growth company you are growing 20% YOY, which clearly means the best use of your money is reinvesting in the company to keep growing and making your shares more valuable, thereby returning value to your shareholders. 

At some point you become SO SUCCESSFUL that you are just a cash generating MACHINE. You literally can’t find investments for the cash your company has. (Think of Apple here...which is almost exactly what happened with Apple). At the point where you and your management team can’t create a reasonable return by reinvesting the money into the company (R&D, M&A, etc) then you can return capital to shareholders and allow them to reallocate that money to other profitable investments themselves. 


That is the pretty standard startup -> growth -> value transition process.

888,1619619612.0,n0fv4o,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

This was for all users in our department, it gave use the ability to see everything about the banking customers: Name, address, SS, balances, transactions, other authorized users, etc. 

Everything we did was tracked and such, but since we were all using the same username there was no way to know which one of us in the department was responsible for which tasks. Lucky for the bank, none of us in our department ever thought to use the info with bad intentions. The most I ever abused the system was to look up a long-lost friend of my mother’s to get her address. My mother and she reconnected and it was a good thing, but we never told her the truth on how we got her address.",gwaceet,t3_n0fv4o

So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

April, July, Oct as another stock may pay Feb. May. Aug. Nov. As another March, June, Sept. Dec...so  instead of reinvesting those dividends use the dividends to pay part of your margin.

I’ve seen post about people have millions on their accounts, so that has made me feel better. But what about $100’th of millions? Like how well are our accounts backed? I just want to rest assure that if I hit a huge trade that I am backed. Crypto is something completely different and I understand that. This is in regards to stocks.

1091,1619538132.0,,,,,"I think you get it now based on the comments. In case you don't:

Imagine you go to the store and you write a check to pay for groceries. And then you forget and buy a PS5 and then have no money in your bank account. The grocery store just got screwed over by you when the check bounces right - you just stole groceries. The grocery store may now say ""hey from now on if you write a check you have to guarantee there's enough to pay for it"". This is what's happening with Robinhood, and all brokers.

Let's use the broker now. If you have $500 with them, let's say Robinhood, and you want to buy a stock for $200 and another stock for $150. When you place the order for the first stock worth $200 let's assume no one else is selling, so there's an open order you've placed for $200 for 1 stock. When you go to place the order for the second stock, your available balance you can use will be $300 (the 500 minus the 200 for the open order). Why? Well if you say place an order for 3 of the $150 stock AND it goes through, that's like you buying the PS5. You'll have spent $450 and only have $50 left, now that first order for $200 you can't actually afford it, Robinhood doesn't want to be the grocery store (no brokers do). Now if someone else now accepts your order for the first stock worth $200 who pays for it? You certainly can't you only have $50 left. To avoid this, while you have the open order for the first stock worth $200, if you try to place another order your available balance will be $300 to make sure you can pay for the first set of groceries.

So let’s say you place your limit at .25 USD per Dogecoin... and you pay Robinhood $1,000.00 for this limit order...
If Dogecoin is currently priced at .269 USD per Dogecoin, you aren’t going to see the $1,000.00 in your buying power because you cannot use it. It is essentially queued up waiting for 1 Dogecoin to fall to .25 USD and if it does and there are available sellers, THEN your $1,000.00 is spent on the Dogecoin and you will see it reflected on your account.

You can cancel a limit order at any time before your limit set is reached... *and* it will automatically be cancelled after a certain amount of time anyway if the price never drops to your set limit.

But keep in mind, if the price **does** drop to .25 USD per Dogecoin... your money will be spent if sellers are available (and there will be most likely lol) and then your money is invested and there’s no going back. Then you are playing the Doge game! Lmfao. Until you decide to sell of course. In that case you will get back whatever returns you have on the Dogecoin, be it negative or positive... **and** this is assuming someone wants to buy your Dogecoin. So don’t set a limit price too low. Because then you’re pretty much setting up an automatic buy-in in the event of the collapse of Dogecoin LOL. Be reasonable with your limits.",gw51cxk,t3_mz5fmw

Not trying to be mean, but it REALLY sounds like you need to learn the basics of stocks/trading and what it means to buy and sell. To put it plainly, I can’t walk into a Microsoft store and buy an Xbox for $50, because they aren’t going to sell the Xbox for that low of a price. Same process behind stocks & crypto.

1194,1619463031.0,mz4w4z,"Hey guys! New to the subreddit, been a lurker on WSB for a long time and discovered this place from In The Money's channel :D This is my first due diligence so feel free to give me any feedback.

**-Why ETF's-**

The truth is, 89% of fund managers fail to beat the market.

According to this report, 88.99% of large-cap US funds have underperformed the S&P500 index over ten years. Knowing this, why do we as individual investors still try to beat the market as opposed to ETF investing? Overconfidence perhaps? Not sure. My main investment is SPY leaps but besides that I have one other secret ETF that has made me very rich...

**-Why investing in a water(liquid gold) ETF could make you rich!-**

I've spent hours upon hours scouring the web for an ETF that I feel could reliably beat the S&P 500 consistently and I think I've found one(two actually). PHO and FIW, two etf's focused on water conservation and infrastructure.

About 70% of the earth's surface is covered in water, but 97% of it is saltwater, which is unfit for human use. Saltwater cannot be used for drinking, crop irrigation, or most industrial uses. Of the remaining 3% of the world's water resources, only about 1% is readily available for human consumption. This creates a demand for desalination infrastructure to solve the global water crisis as the population of the world rapidly rises by the day.

I was watching a TED talk that said in the future, wars will be waged over water. It simply isn't easy to transport and some areas have a lot more than others. For example, everything from steel to potato chips to computers uses water in the production. Did you know that we use 2400 liters of water to produce just one hamburger?

In fact, water futures were created last December because of the growing interest in water investing. If you look at the 13F filings on Whalewisdom you can see that water is also one of the fastest growing sectors among hedge funds.

**-The Big Short-**

I don't know if you guys remember, but Michael Burry said at the end of The Big Short that he is focused only on investing into water. The more due diligence I do on water(Ted talks, books, articles) the more I realize just how right Michael Burry is about this. Michael Burry is also investing in Farmland, along with Bill Gates who is now the world's biggest farmland owner. In addition, water will benefit from the imminent rising inflation due to the fed's QE. After all, it's an essential commodity.

**-Can't be replaced-**

Unlike tech companies which may go out of favor, water will always be essential and relevant to our lives. As the population of the world increases, tendies will flow into our pockets. I almost see this as a no-lose scenerio. Desalination is a necessity, there's no other way around it. The population growth creates the demand, and a growing population is easier to rely on than trying to anticipate consumer demand for something like Apple!

**-Very cheap leaps-**

As of now, you can get $5200 worth of leaps options on PHO for $200-300. Considering this has been rapidly outperforming the SPY, this is a tremendous bargain! FIW is actually better than PHO when you consider performance, however the options are less liquid. I would recommend FIW if you can find a decent price, otherwise PHO should suit you fine.

**-Conclusion-**

I'd advise everyone to do their own research. There's some fancy graphs and TED talk videos on Youtube. Blackrock and other top ETF's know about water and are highly invested. This ETF is one

of the secrets to my success for the last few years(the other being poor man's covered call on certain stable/fed-backed ETF's under low volatility). Other commodity/real estate etf's are also worth looking into(DBA, WOOD, DBC, REIT's) as an inflation hedge and for diversification. I'm looking forward to being an active contributor to this discord! :D",This ETF outperformed SPY!(Investing in water),0.0,,,

1203,1619495461.0,,,,,"I'm kinda old, started with very little money. What has kept me in the game is making it enjoyable. My retirement $$$ is in my boring retirement Vanguard acct... set and forget. My joy is meandering through the stock market  generally buying longterm at least for 1 year due to tax implications. But most held for a lot longer.

For me I don't want it to become a job or stress me out. I want to learn and I want it to be fun. I jumped into Bitcoin and held for a long time and cashed out with a tidy profit to do something else. My husband has his own money and we have much different styles. But I jumped into dogecoin with my brother as a sibling type rivalry thing and it gave us something in common and something to rib each other about. He bowed out. I sold enough to cover taxes and my cost and I'm up $1,800. Even if I lose the rest, I really didn't lose. I'll sell a bit more if it goes to $0.50 and let the rest ride. Sister is coming out on top!

 I still have single shares of some stocks because I was too poor to buy more and it feels good to see 1 share of NVIDIA purchased @ $89...  it's like looking back at your kindergarden photos, I also have 21 shares of NVAX @ $4.47, 14 shares of SQ @$15... wish I had bought more but it is what it is. Lessons big and small. It also reminds me means I did some stuff right even on a tiny scale.

All time returns since 2016 I am at 330% balance around 15.5k

Take some small risks but this should not be with your rent money, use discretionary money that you can afford to lose and set a weekly amount and stick to it.  I started at around $12 a week. Patience and consistency is key but so is the enjoyment. I hope you have fun with it!",gw0h15w,t3_mz02ef
1204,1619453437.0,,,,,I’ve always thought it would be interesting to play the inverse as there may be some level of correction shortly after a huge jump.,gvxzjg1,t3_mz02ef
1205,1619467612.0,,,,,"The FOMO train nearly always leaves bagholders... For instance, I bag-held GSAT for years (which is definitely on the top mover list today as it's up 50% on no news or info).  That said, I like GSAT and think they will be valuable in the future (I have some LEAPS in them that I'm fairly confident will print).  Would I buy the stock now at 1.36?  No way.  

In fact, just because I've seen this thing happen a bunch, I actually bought some $1p 5/21 expecting it to go down in the next few weeks.  If there were great news of a merger or something, jumping in may not be the worst idea, but knowing the company, the news, etc. will help greatly.",gvyx3t2,t3_mz02ef
1206,1619452714.0,,,,,"If by ""On the Move"" you mean momentum stocks then the answer is.....maybe. It depends on the stock and the reason for the movement. There are some extremely high profile analysts that made themselves famous primarily from momentum trading. I think it has potential for being a decent strategy for new investors, if you are willing to do the research to understand the methods and you are extremely good at sticking to the rules of momentum investing. Maybe look up the investing strategy of Jesse Livermore as a good way to understand the basics of momentum trading, but the caution is in the life history because he died a tragic death and stated that he lost great sums of money because he was unable to follow his own rules for investing.",gvxxule,t3_mz02ef

1211,1619462218.0,,,,,"For a long term investing, do you research and put your money in the company you believe will give you a return, this is like staring you own business but instead you invest just a fraction in the company.

With meme stocks it pays to buy them before the craze. I bought dogecoin at .069420 because I thought it was funny and because it had been stagnant for a while.

As another example, I bought Amazon after they announced they're acquiring Whole Foods because their stock remained stagnant at just under $1000 for weeks after the news and I had a feeling that the newly added value would be recognized eventually.

As a third example I bought some weed stocks recently such as YOLO. They're down about 33% - I bought at 30, it's at 20 - but I have a good feeling that they'll come back up in the long run.

Anyway I'd personally use a source of information other than trading platforms for my larger bets, because the fact that a security is being highlighted usually means the market is already in the midst of an adjustment that you missed out on.",gvyqan9,t1_gvyov9i

1281,1619410086.0,,,,,"If your state has income tax, then yes, you would  need to calculate taxes for both. $3000 is lower than the federal standard deduction, so when you calculate taxes it will be $0 (not $300). If that’s really your entire annual income then you’d owe no federal tax. Depending on the state that may be true for your state taxes too. Search “<your state> standard deduction” and see.

Standard deduction is basically an amount you subtract from your income before calculating taxes. For federal 2020 it’s like $12,400. So if you make $3000 then $3000-$12400 is less than $0 so no tax! If you made $20,000 then $20,000-$12,400=$7,600 and you’d owe tax on that $7,600 amount (you’d look up $7600 in the tax table and pay whatever it said is the tax for that).

Taxable income determines whether your long term gains is taxed at 0% or 15%. Fed taxes is zero for the first 40k of long term capital gains. 

I didn't make any money from a job last year. So, my taxable income = 0 + 0 +  long term capital gains of 40k.

Let's use an example of someone with 35K salary, 2k stock short term gains and 10k long term gains

The salary and stock short term gains will be taxed like normal income. This amounts to 37k. Now you have space for $3k worth of long term capital gains left. 

The first 3k will be taxed at 0%, while the next 7k will be taxed at 15%.

In other words, there's actually an incentive in the Fed Taxation rule for you to avoid realizing short term gains or have a regular job.

A jobless retiree with a massive portfolio of stocks can just slowly sell off 40K of stocks every year for your living expense with zero fed tax, and zero state tax (assuming you live in a tax free state). Also, this 40k number keeps increasing by a few hundred dollars too. Use that free money and live in a 3rd world country where expenses are 1/10 of the US. 

You said that you live in CA like me, so we both are screwed by the capital gains taxation of California. Short term/long term capital gains are treated identically, which is why I am paying that $800+. Definitely considering to move to Nevada soon, where that number is 0.",gvz7amm,t1_gvv8dsb

It's shocking how many people are under the impression that SMS is secure.  It's not; not in any way, shape or form.

If you use SMS/texts, then essentially everyone on the entire SS7 network can see your messages.  It's like sending unsecured packets over the internet, it's just a stupid thing to do.  NO ONE should be using SMS for security purposes!

There is an argument that it's better than nothing, but even that is questionable because being lulled into a false sense of security might very well be worse, because then you let your guard down \*thinking\* you're secure when you're not.  

Are you better off or worse off having a screen door if a burglar comes to your home?  If you don't have a screen door, you're far more likely to have your front door closed and locked.  If you have a screen door then you may very well lock the screen door, but because it's not really secure, it's not protecting you.

2FA is a great idea.  2FA over SMS is a \*terrible\* idea.  The only reason it's being used is because nearly everyone has a phone number that can receive texts and they know how to find them.  It's laziness on the part of banks and financial organizations.",gw8vfza,t3_mx2fvy

No, it shouldn't. If your bank is purposefully misunderstanding ACH transfers and you know you've correctly entered your checking account number rather than the savings account number, they are likely doing it to violate Regulation D with the intent of charging you transaction fees (after 6 transactions/month). This and overdraft fees (overdraft protection enabled by default) are becoming common again after the last administration started flirting with the idea of striking decade old rules at the CFPB back in 2019.

You should have 1500 in your Robinhood account once the transfer is fully completed. If you are saying that the transfer is completed and you don’t have 1500 just 1000 then it is either an error and you should contact support or the transfer is not completed and the 1000 is the instant deposit and you are still waiting for it to be completed.

Long term, Oatly gas it on lock.  Their Barista edition is always selling out at most supermarkets around me.  Supply isn't matching the demand currently. At least not in my area.  That says quite a bit.

I cut it into 10 slices.  You buy one slice for 1$  
I sell 8 more slices.  

But then a bunch of people want that last slice so I sell it for $2   

You still have 1 slice.  The value jumps up to $2 so if you sold it, you will make profit.  You don’t own a full pie though.  Then you rush and go buy a bunch of pie slices at $2 since you just had big gains and hope it keeps growing.  

Unfortunately however, people decide they don’t want to spend $2 on a slice of pie so the value drop back down to $1 and you own a bunch of pie slices but have lost a bunch of money.

Just taking numbers into account -

You’ve sold a put @8 and recd @0.26. This means you’re bullish on the price and saying that price will be 8 or above.
Selling a put limits your upside so your max profit will be the selling price I.e. 0.26$
And your max loss will be -(8-0)+0.26 = -7.74$

You can calculate your net payoff on expiration date as -(8-X)+.26 where X is price at expiration

You have 2 options -
1. Play it out till the expiration date
2. buying cover (netting off) your put option now (given the numbers above you’ll make a loss of .38-.26 =-0.12

1841,1619046208.0,,,,,"I was like you a month ago, no clue. Selling Puts is nothing wrong that you collect money upfront, and hope your option expire worthless so you can keep the money collected only if the stock price goes above your strike price. Here’s my advice just for your reference: 

1. Wait the day before or on the day your option expires, if still losing money, Roll your option to the later week or weeks, so you hope the stock price will go back up above your strike price. To roll option, Simply click Roll Option button on your trading platform. I made a mistake before by not knowing that function, simply clicked buy back, but never sell again which costed me tons of money. 

2. Close your option once the stock price bounce back and above your cost. or based on your own judgement of the stock direction, set your profit target, either keep part of premium to close the put by buying back, or wait until the option expire worthless and keep full premium you collected. The only risk is you never know if the stock goes to the direction you wanted or not. 

Go to Youtube search option trading to educate yourself, there are tons of videos.

Say I wanted to sell to close on a call contract with a wide bid/ask spread. I aim for the mid range and click submit. Immediately the displayed value of my contracts take a huge dip and it does not seem to recover even after cancelling the placed order. Can anyone explain this? I have tested it out on multiple stocks and I can not wrap my head around why the option contract value should immediately change after I hit submit. Unless my placed (but unfilled) orders are somehow incredibly significant to the value. I find this hard to believe when I am talking about a simple 1 or 2 contracts.

Any help on this would be much appreciated. Or any tips on preventing this would be great. Thanks!

Take the SPY chart (or S&P 500 or any other major index).  Put it on a 5 year graph.  If you squint your eyes you'll notice that you can pretty much draw a fairly straight line from 5 years ago to today and that the actual value of SPY is fairly close to it.

So what has happened in the last 3 months?  We have caught up to around where the market would have been if the crash had not happened.  We are even slightly above where the market ""should have been"" if you strictly follow the straight line idea.

My theory is that stock prices have been recovering so quickly that the stock prices have gone above the actual value of the stocks.

Meanwhile short interest and utilization rate have been slowly going up as they continue to suppress the natural price action of those two stocks while DTC and OTC regulations get implemented as a safety net for non-defaulting DTCC members, thereby costing the short sellers more by the day to maintain their positions just to keep a lid on those two stocks, because once they go it's off to the races.

All that leads to the busted hedges being forced to liquidate assets across the market to have collateral on hand, per new SEC regulation, for when the margin call comes (whether its next week or in six months). get ready to see more viacom/royal canadian bank type sell offs in the coming weeks.

I'm not someone who looks at charts, but I'm a W.B. walking into a shop and asking which food is the most popular and its brand. Having received the answer, I buy those shares and wait for them to go up. But there is a value that cannot be found neither on charts, nor on financial statements, nor in shops: human value and potential.

I am not referring to the CEO or the CFO but to the people who make the company at the lower levels. I am referring to their behaviors, their attachment to work and the brand. What company is it that its employees are afraid of saying they are wrong if they are then fired. Better silence and go as it goes. There is a story that I invite you to read, and make yours for the future, a true story that can make you unique Redditors: The Story of a lost USB key from a leading company and of a person who found it. I'm not telling you more because you have to find this story on the internet. Then if you can't find it, ask me where to find it and I'll see if you can let you know.

2252,1618840838.0,mu1834,"Hi just wanted to get some clarity.   


Let's say I made 10k on an asset, and then I sell. I've got  +10k.  


Let's say then I reinvest that 10k into the same asset, it goes up another 2k. Then I sell it again for profit of 12k.  


When considering taxes on the 2nd trade, am I being taxed for 12k or 2k in capital gains?",Quick Question: Am I being taxed per trade profit?,184.0,,,
2253,1618846078.0,,,,,You’re not going to get taxed for $22k of profit if that’s what you’re asking. You’ll be taxed for the first $10k you sold for and then for the $2k of profit you got on the second.,gv3ahi2,t3_mu1834
2254,1618849499.0,,,,,You would get taxed on the first 10 and the additional 2k. But your rate will greatly depend on how long you held the asset for. If it's less than a year than you will get taxed at a regular rate but if it's over a year you get some real tax breaks.,gv3imdb,t3_mu1834
2255,1618841793.0,,,,,"$10k on the first and $2k on the second trade. You'd go broke in no time if your tax burden compounded.

I think a lot of newer, young investors don’t even realize there are tax implications for stocks and crypto. Especially with all the recent hype around investing and all this money younger people are making from like doge coin. 

It’s good you’re asking this now because I think a lot of people could be in for a reality check when tax season comes. I wish all the investing subs - stock or crypto - should pin or include tax info in their sidebars.",gv3p6n3,t3_mu1834

2258,1618854548.0,,,,,"It’s called the stock market for a reason. Forget all the fancy Mumbo jumbo, pretend you are at a farmers market. 

You go to the farmers market to buy some seeds from a seed farmer, pay for it, and off you go. 

You go home, plant them let them grow.

Now you got yourself some produce, you want to sell them and make some money.

You go back to the market this time as a seller, you make a transaction,sell some produce, and you pay tax on it. 

You sell/make another transaction, pay tax on that, so on and on. 

If you don’t sell some produces and keep them, no tax needs to be paid as they are yours and they could continue to grow/or store. (terrible analogy now).

Edit- 
keep in mind, 1 year or less of holding any GAINS and sell = higher tax, 1 year or more of holding any GAINS before selling = less tax.

2261,1618867107.0,,,,,"Wash sales aside, the taxman doesn’t really care how many or the exact nature of the trades it took you to make a profit.

Think about it this way:

Let’s say you started the year with $50K.  You bought some asset and then sold it at $60K.  Sweet, you just made a $10K profit, as per your example.

You invest more money and then make another $2K.  So now you have a total of $62K cash.

The taxman says, you had $50K and now you have $62K.  That’s $12K profit.  We’ll take the tax on that, thank you very much.

Now, one exception to this rule might be if you straddle tax years.  For example, let’s suppose that you bought the initial $50K asset in March 2019, sold for $60K in April. Then you purchased $10K in December 2019 and sold for $12K in January 2020.

Depending on your individual tax situation, it’s possible that the $10K profit would be counted in the 2019 tax year and the additional $2K would be counted in 2020.  That’s to say, you’d still taxed on the full amount ($12K) but depending on the timing of your trades, it could be divided across two years.",gv4nrqy,t3_mu1834
2262,1618856848.0,,,,,"Part of the tax code differentiates between Longterm and short term capital gains. Longterm capital gains (held for at least 1 year) have their own tax brackets (which are set by your income level). Short term capital gains are usually taxed as an addition to your normal income. That being said, when you are only taxed in the gains you make, so in your example the 10k you make initially and then the subsequent 2k would be the tax base. Assuming you have already paid taxes on or are tax exempt from the money you used to invest initially the IRS will never tax you on income you’ve already paid your taxes on (theres a few exceptions). Another thing, if you take a loss on an asset you held for three months, that will lower the short-term capital gains tax base that you have. Same thing for longterm, but a longterm capital loss can never be used to offset a short-term gain.",gv406tl,t3_mu1834

You have another stock that you bought for $100 but it is now $50 but it is a good stock and you don’t want to sell it but you want to take the loss.  (You take losses because you can offset gains with losses.)  You sell it for $50 and pick it back up for $50 the same day (or within 31 days) thinking you can apply the loss against the gain and report $0 gain to the IRS and owe no taxes.  That is not the case.   The sale and repurchase of the stock within 31 days is considered a “wash sale” and that loss is not reportable as a loss to the IRS.  You still owe taxes on the $50.  Now you have lowered your cost basis of the $100 stock that you sold for $50 but not to worry because that loss is added to your cost basis and it still looks like you paid $100 for capital gain purposes.,gv4tppd,t1_gv3xedw

Not exactly true, but pretty close. All you have to do is sell the replacement shares incurred from the wash transaction before the end of the year, i.e. December 31. The easiest way to do this is to just close out your entire position that you have wash sales in.

Then do not buy back for 30 days after the fact. So if you sold on December 30, do not buy back until January 31. To be safe, I'd wait a few extra days.

This is why you get your tax docs in February. Your broker has to be sure you didn't buy back in during January.",gv76bvo,t1_gv5oiiv

We all know Peloton as the popular home-workout brand. Is the company purely a covid play or were they always destined for success? WallStreet seems to valuate the company as a low-margin hardware company, but should that really be the case? We’ll go through some of the ins and outs of the company’s metrics, potential risks, catalysts, and a look at the company’s growth as the world re-opens from lockdowns.

**Covid play or is this the new trend?**

It could be debated that Peloton would not be where they are today without covid and the global lockdowns that occurred. However, were they truly a covid play or did the virus simply speed up the process of them becoming a home-workout powerhouse? The world is re-opening, but demand for their bikes are still at peak. The CEO noted in their latest earnings call (Feb-04-2021) that even with the vaccine roll-out demand for the bike has not decreased.

“We still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. We haven't seen any softening of demand.”

A look at Google search trends for the term “Peloton” as well as their traffic estimation from high-end SEO tools would also suggest that demand has remained consistent.

&#x200B;

Peloton has been accurate with their next-quarter guidance and they’ve been beating estimates consistently, but they seem to slightly sand-bag full-year guidance creating “easy beats”. Let’s go through a few factors that make Peloton the strong company that they are, and a deep dive into some of the growth they can expect post-covid.

**Brand Loyalty** 

Peloton has succeeded in becoming the go-to name for in-home cycling classes, and as they expand, the in-home workout leader. Their brand-loyalty also rivals some of the best of the best. When looking at the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is a ranking of brand loyalty, Peloton has a score in the high 90’s which is a greater score than BOTH Apple and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/yyuwhwehvxt61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd6838be56deb1e3f136871b78d6b2b8e0a8edb

This is attributed to the high-quality content the company pushes to end-users through their pre-recorded and live classes. Users always have plenty of options when it comes to taking classes with their favorite instructors. Their NPS score is even more evident with the churn-rate Peloton experiences on memberships. Is the churn-rate really that important? In this industry, yes, and in my opinion this is what will differentiate Peloton as more of a tech valuation instead of “just” a hardware company.

To give you reference of how good Peloton’s churn rate is, let’s compare it to Apple TV+ and Netflix. First, the “churn” is the rate of attrition the company experiences over a time-period. Basically it means how often they are **losing** customers. AppleTV+ has a [20% churn rate](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/), which is quite high, while Netflix has a [churn rate of 3%](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/). So what was Peloton’s churn rate last quarter? 0.76%, some of the lowest levels in *any* industry. The company has consistently had churn under 1% since the Pandemic began, and they expect churn to remain under 0.80% for the foreseeable future. You must remember that this number affects the *recurring revenue* source for the company, which is critical for them.

**Big revenue growth, almost no profits. What gives?**

While it’s true that Peloton has been having blow-out quarter after blow-out quarter, they have just barely been profitable. Last quarter (Q2-2021), they did a mere $63.6 million of net income [**on over a billion in revenue**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549). Doesn’t look great from the outside, but we have to remember that this company has been selling every single bike they’ve ever produced and can barely keep up with the high demand over the last 4 quarters. They’ve invested aggressively into the expansion of their [**supply chain infrastructure**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/) and recently they [**acquired Precor**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor), another fitness chain with strong connections to hotels and gyms, for $420 million. The Precor acquisition will substantially increase domestic manufacturing capabilities for their bike and tread product. Here’s a look at the current OTD (order-to-delivery) times within the USA, from the Peloton website.

https://preview.redd.it/kwnbtizivxt61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96981504fb19209f11e56ef8bd49795c8d5eaf0

We can see that even after exponentially increasing their production capacity over the last year customers still need to wait weeks or months to receive the product. Peloton has been working hard to get delivery times down to the desired 1-2 weeks. Management noted that with these aggressive supply chain investments they will be able to get there by Q3 or Q4, 2021. Management commented on OTD times in their last earnings call.

“the successes that we're seeing in getting the order to delivery down and getting our backlog down are 100% based on incredible upgrades, and our manufacturing capacity up to over six times -- 6x increase in just the last 12 months in our capacity of them know -- we're now making more Bikes on a monthly basis than we did in all of fiscal 2018”

Due to covid there’s been a lot of delays (unloading times 4x longer than a year ago) at the west coast port-of-entry that has forced Peloton to re-schedule many deliveries. Another reason why net profits have been affected to such an extant is that Peloton has already started what they expect to be over 100 million expenditure in expediting shipments using more expensive methods (air freight). From the CC:

“Though we're beginning to see the benefits of our extensive supply chain investments, our delivery wait times remain elevated… we are investing over $100 million in expedited shipping to reduce the wait times for our products.

But what I can say is that we do expect that this $100 million, which we recognize is a very large investment. We believe will get us back to normal shipping protocol by the end of this fiscal year… the expedited shipping investment brings down OTD. And that gets inventory into warehouses, which is going to allow us to get aggressive with marketing really for the first time”

**Risks to the downside**

I’m seeing a few notable risks that might have a negative effect on the company. I’ll go through them here:

**Cheaper Competition:** we have a less “premium” brand also entering the scene with NordicTrack now providing similar products at a much lower cost.

**Long delivery times:** It’s only natural that when you go to the checkout page for your brand new Peloton bike and see a delivery time of nearly 2-3 months you might be turned away to a competitor (such as the NordicTrack, ProForm, or SoulCycle bike). However, like we mentioned earlier is that Peloton has extremely high brand loyalty. People want a Peloton, just like they prefer Apple iPhone over Samsung (or vice versa), or Lululemon clothing instead of the off-brand (and much cheaper) at Walmart.

**Re-opening risks:** As the world re-opens the risk of churn becomes higher as well. However, it is my opinion that gym-goers will maintain both their gym membership as well as their Peloton membership. This is not a “one or the other” case. I would not be surprised if Peloton subscriber churn rate stayed under 1% as everything re-opens. A risk to the company none-the-less.

**Low-margin equipment sales:** Back in August 2020, Peloton CEO noted that each bike is sold at nearly break-even, meaning they don’t make any money on the sale. The true net-profit will be locking the user into the Peloton content ecosystem. He also stated that due to the economies of scale they are creating that eventually (and most likely already), they will be making a profit on each bike sold. He also mentions on the Q1 2021 earnings call that both the original Bike and the Bike+ have extremely similar margins. Peloton doesn’t disclose the specific mix of their products that attribute to revenues and how many treads were sold vs bikes vs Bike+, but I think it’s safe to assume that each of their products will have similar margins.

**Freight Pricing Pressure:** This has been quite a challenge for the company. They’ve been maneuvering through logistics issues and have dedicated $100 million to reducing the OTD times to keep new customers happy. Due to covid, this freight pricing pressure might continue for the rest of the year and possibly longer. Management has noted that their forward guidance does already include these inefficiencies, which is obvious because the company’s growth in 2020 would have been much stronger had it been able to fulfill every single order it had on the books.

**Over-investment into supply chain:** There are also some risks associated with all these supply chain investments the company is making. Right now it seems like a smart play to keep up with the demand of bikes and treads, but at what cost? 420 million Precor acquisition, an extra 100 million investment in expediting shipments, further investments into their Taiwan manufacturing site are all cutting deeply into margins. There is risk that 2-3 years from now they have more supply than demand and the question of the validity of these supply-chain investments may come up. However, in my opinion, Peloton management has been doing a great job at managing the difficulties not only with logistics through covid, but also with the explosive growth the company has seen.

**Potential Catalysts**

**International Expansion**

Until now Peloton has been laser-focused on the U.S market. They’ve been slowly [expanding into Europe and Canada](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-expands-to-europe-and-canada-300644577.html), and have just recently opened up the tread market in United Kingdom. From their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had some positive comments to say about European markets:

“U.K. Tread sales have exceeded our expectations, and our early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.”

The demand for Peloton is highest in the United States at the moment, but that doesn’t go to say the product can’t succeed internationally. In my opinion, *when* demand in the U.S starts to decrease it will be off-set by the increase of growth in international markets.

**More on the Precor Acquisition**

Going back a bit more on the Precor acquisition. This was a strategic move by management and will have a two-fold positive effect on the company. The first is that delivery times will finally be shortened with the wide manufacturing footprint that will be created in the U.S. This will also alleviate stress of high shipping costs that the company has incurred. The Precor deal and having a U.S based factory should lead to better performance for Peloton’s bottom line. Second, Precor has very good relationships with channels that Peloton has not yet penetrated. This will help Peloton gain instant-access to some very lucrative end-markets, which include schools, clubs, hotels, and gyms. When asked about the Precor acquisition on their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had to say:

“it's been enormous curiosity about what this could mean in terms of delivering a combined Precor Peloton experience in the commercial channel”

They want to get Peloton into all these channels and the possibilities are endless.

**Economies of Scale**

It’s evident the company has been bogged down by extensive costs and “growing pains”. They’ve maneuvered through the Pandemic and are meeting extremely high demand by spending a lot more on shipping and getting product from their factory in Taiwan to the warehouse in the United States. They also have large expenditures on creating content, hiring instructors, and maintaining the quality of product. All this to keep users engaged. With the Precor acquisition, these expenses will become a lower percent of the revenue generated as margins are increased and revenue increases.

**Valuation**

There are quite a few topics I want to touch base on in terms of the company’s valuation. I think if we were to use a benchmark of value, we could look at Nautilus Inc (NLS), which is a fitness equipment manufacturing company, is currently trading at 1x trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenues… On the other side of things, you have tech stocks trading at incredibly high valuations all because they are bringing in high-margin recurring revenue. So the debate will be low-margin hardware versus high-margin recurring revenue. Peloton fits somewhere in the middle.

WallStreet’s main concerns for Peloton are going to be over the company’s margins, and the longevity of the increased “covid” demand. The big question is, what happens when demand slows? After-all, the market is a forward-looking. I want to look at this in two ways. The first is going to be international expansion off-setting a slow in growth in the United States. The second is going to be a look at the recurring revenues and continued subscriber growth over the next 2-3 years.

**Demand**

As with any product, the demand for Peloton products will eventually plateau. Peloton has done well by releasing the new treadmill product, with rumors of a rowing machine and other in-home fitness equipment. I would not be surprised to see Peloton develop a very robust product line. However, as growth slows in one segment (bikes) a new segment will open up (tread/rower/other products). With 2 million in cash on the balance sheet Peloton is in a great position to expand their brand into other segments both in the domestic USA and internationally.

Peloton’s expansion internationally is still in the very early stages as they’ve only just began to penetrate these markets. Like I touched up on previously, the increased demand internationally will off-set some of the growth slowing in the United States. The end-goal of the company is to increase margins on their hardware products, while selling a lot of it, and then locking users into their ecosystem with the recurring subscription which will be a big money-maker for them.

**Subscriptions**

The subscription revenues, which currently have a 60% gross profit, are going un-noticed with the company’s valuation. In their most recent quarter (Q2-2021) they did over 1.064 billion in revenue. From that revenue, approximately 81.7% came from sales of bikes, treads, and other products in their “connected fitness” segment. The other 18.3% came from subscription revenue. Their “connected fitness” and “subscription revenue” segments also come in with gross profits of 35.3%, and 60.3%, respectively.

Their guidance for Q3-2021 had similar performance to last quarter, where they guided another billion in revenue and an additional 300m subscribers to their network. This is also coming off their holiday season quarter, which generally provides an additional boost in sales. In my opinion, I think it would be safe to assume that continued high demand in the U.S market, with growing international exposure will get the company doing $2 billion in revenue per quarter. Remember that 18.3% of that revenue is recurring from their subscription model. This would generate about $366 million in subscription revenue per quarter, and on a twelve-month basis approximately $1.47 billion per year. Here’s a look at their Q2-2021 revenue and subscriber growth.

https://preview.redd.it/no1s4xkkvxt61.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d9030c404791abd6563d9ef13c605fd7a20279

Peloton currently has a market cap of $32 billion. *If* the company were to achieve $2 billion revenues per quarter in 1-2 years, which in my opinion is quite probable, then at current valuations they would be trading at 4x sales, with 20% of that coming from recurring subscriptions. Don’t forget they have a strong balance sheet with just over 2 million in cash assets for future investments.

I like the stock and would like to invest in it while it is trading at a market cap below 10-15x revenues. At that same valuation today they would be priced at $180 instead of $110.

**TLDR;**

1. The company has had blowout quarter after blowout quarter, but barely turning a profit. They have been experiencing “growing pains” and invested heavily into their supply chain infrastructure. $420 million Precor acquisition, $100 million in *additional* expedited shipping costs, and digital content production have cut heavily into their margins.
2. They are doing $1 billion revenues per quarter and with steady growth they might get up to $2 billion per quarter in 2022. Approximately 20% of that revenue will be *recurring* revenue from their fitness subscription model. Not only that, but they are also adding 300m new subscribers to their ecosystem each quarter. 
3. With all these supply chain infrastructure upgrades they are still selling every single bike they can produce. Management noted that demand has remained high even with global vaccine roll-outs. They are just getting their feet wet with international markets, which could provide another boost in demand.
4. There are a few concerns about the company moving forward, such as: low margin product, over-investment in new factories and acquisitions, long delivery times turning customers to competitors, and re-opening risks. We’ve addressed these above.
5. If the company can prove they are more than a “hardware” manufacturing company WallStreet will give them the proper valuation. They are currently on track to have over 2m paying members to their integrated fitness model and I would not be surprised if they hit over 3-4 million members by 2022.",Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD),11.0,,,

Last 2 years I have been a member of Robinhood with around 20k\~ mostly in ETFs, Apple, Microsoft, etc so I have decent knowledge in how the market goes. I am aware that ultimately anything can happen in the market and it could could drop ALOT (Coronavirus) however I am under 30 and the money isn't that critical as I have no student loans, already paid off my car and have a relatively cheap monthly house payment, and I make 6 figures at my job. I plan on putting the rest perhaps in a REIT and perhaps 10% in the savings account in the event everything fails. I also figured to diversify the savings investment into two broker apps which are Robinhood and Charles Swab to reduce the damage if a catastrophic event were to occur on the either app.

I am interested in the feedback / constructive criticism from this awesome community on my current plan. Also would be cool to read on other investment vehicles I am not aware of. I have no plans on buying any government bonds/CDs for a crude annual yield.  Would also love to hear from people who may be doing something like this!

However, it is fun to play with some of the money.  You have a lot of time, so you can be aggressive, but if you are concerned with losses, then I would recommend safer investments.  Do research, invest slowly, don't expect huge gains in the short term and you will be fine.

I also have a smaller IRA on which I run the wheel just to keep things interesting and tax-free.

2467,1620568024.0,n8el75,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",158.0,,,

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough. 

Thanks",Capital gains tax period with mergers,92.0,,,
2566,1620416868.0,,,,,"I doubt you need to see an accountant.  Most stock for stock mergers in the US are tax-free (which means the holding period doesn't restart) to shareholders, but there are requirements that must be met for tax-free treatment.  There are three ways to figure out whether the acquisition qualified (assuming you are in the US, and the companies are in the US):

\- Easiest - find the press release for the merger, which should say whether the merger will be tax-free for investors).  If it doesn't say, don't assume it will be taxable, but use one of the other ways.

\- Find the tax disclosure in the merger proxy.  Look up the old company on the SEC's website using EDGAR.  Find the DEFM14A, which is the merger proxy.  Search for ""tax"".  There will be a few pages on tax consequences, but best to find the FAQs (usually called ""Question and Answers"") or the comment in the Summary re taxes

\- Send a message to RH and they should be able to tell you when your holding period started

Note, any cash received would most likely be taxable. 

An example of a merger proxy is here:

I'm no longer on Robinhood so I'm not sure if you can just look that up or if you have to request your paperwork with them.  If you see that your shares are not showing as long-term, that's Robinhood's problem, as they are required to give you accurate data for tax purposes.  Bring it up with them if there's a problem.  I know I can look at all of my gains/losses broken into short and long term at any time with my current broker.   A merger or other ticker change does not change your date of purchase or cost basis.  Note:  I have not experienced this first-hand, so of course consult a tax professional if your gains still show as short term (assuming you even sold them and the issue comes up).",gxb3aux,t3_n75o8q
2568,1620414456.0,,,,,"Assume you're in the US? I think what you're saying is you're trying to avoid SHORT TERM cap gains right? My impression is that a merger shouldn't affect that - your cost basis and holding period should remain. I'd get advice on this from a tax professional however first.

2569,1620417755.0,,,,,"You're good.

No capital gains, until you sell the new stock. I've had this happen to me several times before. 

The catch is if it is a cash to shareholders or partial cash to shareholds in the transaction, you will have to pay capital gains on the cash. If it is less then a year short-term gains rules apply.

This isn't uncommon as the buying company only gives even unsplit shares out and the pricing dictated some people ended up with 5.33 shares. The company might give you 5 shares of the new stock and the value of 0.33 shares in cash. You would then have capitol gains on that cash.

&#x200B;

The safest way to check is post-merge check your brokerage account. There will be a section that is called something along the line of ""Realized Gain/Loss"" and you can see your list of gains and losses taken for the year as they occur. You might need to be on the website version of your brokerage account access.

I can see where I had a cash gain due to these partial shares being paid in cash right now in my account in 2020.

In 2020, I had another stock sold to another company that was an all-cash offer, and I had to take capital gains on the year that buy-out of the company happened. 

It will also show you if you had a holding go completely bankrupt and was completely devalued. You can't control when you take that loss, unless you sell it in advance.

&#x200B;

Another scenario, it can also show you. Slightly more complex. I owned Yahoo a few years ago. They old off assets from their primary company, but they also owned stocks in other companies. The biggest was Alibaba. When Yahoo went out of business the stock turned into a holding company with no long-term intention to be an investment company. Over time they sold off their assets and gave shareholders cash directly. I can't control when they distribute that cash, but I pay capitol gains on that in the year they pay me. Oddly enough, these things can take years sometimes and it can become hard to sell off these companies when they are no longer listed in a stock exchange and they become smaller. I usually try to get out of these companies before they get to that point.",gxb90fl,t3_n75o8q

2582,1620416370.0,,,,,"Hey everyone, new investor with <500 put into my RH acc so far. I have a question about ETF’s & Crypto. From what i’ve learned it seems that diversification works well for someone looking to grow their money over a long period of time. Because of that I put my money into 8 different etf’s a couple weeks ago. Last week, i dove a little deeper into crypto and found ethereum. Seems like a pretty safe bet long term to either break even or sky like bitcoin, so i added some to my portfolio. Recently I read that it’s basically pointless to have so many etfs because of inevitable overlapping, so i’m down to 5 etf’s and eth. My splits are: VTI-20%, VOO-20%, VTG-20%, ETH-20%, MSOS-10%, VONG-10%. Is this a decent plan? 


TLDR: Portfolio is VTI-20%, VOO-20%, VTG-20%, ETH-20%, MSOS-10%, VONG-10%. About to add funds, Will it work long term?",gxb61qd,t3_n6uyqq

2599,1620308797.0,,,,,"If you are on a (free) cash account, it is impossible that you will owe money, as you will only be able to use what you deposit (buying power), you can only buy what you have the available buying power for and whatever you buy can only go to $0, not negative.

If you are on an (free) instant account, when you start a transfer to Roninhood, they make the $ amount instantly available to you for trading, even though it hasn't been withdrawn from your bank yet. So the only way you can owe money is if you start a transfer but it gets returned insufficient funds from your bank, and they will reverse the transfer.

On both free accounts, interest isn't paid, its earned. I have a 0.3% interest rate (be aware that is zero point three percent, as in less than 1 percent, not 30 percent), and you will accrue interest monthly on any cash in your Robinhood portfolio.

You should see something called Margin Investing - check and ensure that it’s disabled. If you enable Margin Investing, you’re essentially trading on borrowed funds, where you’ll owe 2.5% flat interest rate on anything above $1000. 

You could end up owing money in two ways:

1. If you have margin enabled, where you trade on borrowed money and you don’t profit and end up owing RH money. If this happens, you’ll get a “margin call” to make up for the funds. 
2. If you play with some sophisticated options like credit spreads, which may not go your way.

A. You will never owe money from your loses - should you decide to sell your investment back at a lower price.

B. If you sell your stock, or crypto at a higher price in which you get a profit, you will owe taxes on what you earned as a ""short term capitol gain"". (Example, your investment from 10 dollars went to 20, and you sold. You will owe taxes on the 10 dollars earned)

2640,1620318544.0,,,,,"This may get downvoted, but it’s wrong to tell new users that options are bad outright. Options are a useful tool if you have done your research and are within your risk tolerance. There’s an unhealthy amount of “YOLO” options posts on subs like /r/options and WSB, but the demonization of options in general is just as unhealthy. It’s like telling your adolescent child not to take drugs or smoke cigarettes *without explaining why that behavior carries risk.*

That said, if you are new to trading you don’t want to dip your feet into options until you 1) Have studied and understand the different types of options and how they work (lots of resources on YouTube) 2) Have done an adequate amount of research on the particular stock you want to place an option on, and 3) Have a decent amount in your brokerage account (usually around $10,000) because some of them do carry risk of losing money.

2645,1620326421.0,,,,,"You own AMZN at $4,000 on December 15th and sell AMZN for $2000 (-$2000).

You rebuy AMZN at $2000 on December 16th and sell AMZN for $4,000 on December 31st ($2,000).

For the tax season of that year you owe taxes on the $2,000 that you made but cannot claim the $2,000 you lost.

If you day trade and do this many times your losses won't help you on that year of taxes but your gains will still owe taxes. So if you trade a million times and make $1 every other trade and lose $1 every other trade you need to pay taxes on $500,000 you made although in reality you have $0 in your pocket. 

 It's important to note that if you're more than 30 days before Jan 1 this doesn't matter at all. This is to prevent people from selling at a loss and buying the security right back so they can show a loss on their taxes and still own the security.",gx6joay,t1_gx65no0

2652,1620413897.0,,,,,"Not OP but I would think it's because most forces are trying to drive the prices up, so puts are already at a disadvantage. The company itself is trying to do things that make the price go higher, sometimes the government is taking action to try to keep the overall stock market going up, etc. Overall the odds are already against you to start with.

Plus, just think about the price of the stock itself. It goes down when lots of people sell it, but people have to own the stock before they can sell it, so you can typically keep an eye on stuff like that based on the numbers, rumors, etc. You can get a somewhat decent idea of the risk level of a selloff when buying a call. However, a stock goes up when people are buying, and you have no way of knowing when someone out there is about to make a massive purchase that is going to drive the price up, or when the company is going to make an announcement that will cause a buying frenzy, etc. all of which can come out of nowhere and completely screws you over if you have a put.

I buy it again the next day at $900. It goes to $1000 and I sell. Profit $100.

This means I pay taxes on the $100 gain but don’t offset anything with the $100 loss? Even though I am net $0?

EDIT: in other words, to avoid this issue, if I sell at a loss I MUST not buy the same stock for at least 30 days?

Also what about the reverse situation...
Buy at $900, sell at $1000. 
Next day buy at $1000 sell at $900.

No capital gains tax on the $100 gained but benefit from $100 loss? Or it only works to the IRS’s favor?",gx6itsa,t1_gx6db2y

You still have to claim the gain but cannot claim the loss.  The order of the transactions doesn't matter.

2671,1620252892.0,,,,,"Margin is basically a line of credit based on the equity in your account.

The way you pay it back is deposit more money or sell so that you place cash back into your account, if you are running on margin the cash will go against your margin. Keep in mind last time I checked the margin rates for robinhood they were about 2% and they gave you $1000 that doesn't accumulate interest.

So you can run $1000 into margin and not be charged any monthly interest. You will pay their $5 for robinhood gold, but it's worth it IMO.",gx2xnnh,t3_n5pl3t

2678,1620259846.0,,,,,"This.

You need the amount available to cover the margin you borrowed before you can turn it off.

So, let's say you have $1000 margin invested and $500 in cash. You need to sell $500 so that you have $1000 ""in cash"" before you can turn margin off.

Once it's off, you'll have $0 in cash because you paid back the margin (and $500 left invested).

2683,1620274397.0,,,,,"A common view of the “safe” way to use margin is sort of like an extended version of RH’s instant deposit. You want to enter a position (option or stock) but need to deposit more? Use margin to get in the position you want while you wait for a deposit to process. 

Of course you *can* just use it as extra funds for a fee, and I’ll admit I do that too, but there’s a view that that can be dangerous but even moreso wasteful because of the interest if you do it long term. 

Granted I’m on TDA now so my interest is like 10% or something, which is a bigger hit than robinhood’s apparently amazing rate.",gx445hy,t1_gx3ohvl

2688,1620295758.0,,,,,"Correct.  Margin allows you to get in and out of each position  instantly.  Some ETFs have over 24 hours to clear and if you sell a position, it can take several days for your funds to be available.  If you need to deposit money, it usually takes a few days as well.

I’m only behind like 20-15$ eso since I I got till Monday and another 15$ coming in tomorrow which should make me flush.. Yeah im sure I’ll have plenty more of that in buying power. I was just wonder IF. IF.  The worst was to happen. And I am short? what if? I already don’t want to know and will probably take care of it. I just don’t want them liquidating one of my positions. ESP over such small pennies. If they do I mine as well use the whole 5k lot. Jk. That’s bad thinking I don’t wanna be in any hole after climbing out of one that took 10yrs.

There are some cases where your broker will liquidate your position automatically if you suffer sufficient losses on short or leveraged positions, in which case you will need to repay any shortfall in the account. 

One example:
You deposit $5,000 into your account, then purchase $8,000 of weekly in the money calls using robinhood gold. The underlying drops 20% during the holding period and the options expire worthless. Robinhood will either have liquidated the position once the value dropped sufficiently, or an hour before expiration on the expiration date. You now owe robinhood $3,000. 

If you are not intimately familiar with the mechanics of options I would strongly suggest not trading them.",gww9xaz,t3_n4f7ns
2752,1620125047.0,,,,,If just buying calls or puts yes you can only lose premium.,gww3xmw,t3_n4f7ns
2753,1620138393.0,,,,,"No. Apart from what it means to exercise an option, the first thing to understand is the ability to exercise a contract is available only for option buyers - not option sellers. When you buy an option you 'own' the rights within the contract. This is not true for option sellers. The selling party has sold the rights within the contract and therefore cannot exercise those rights (since they do not own them).

The second thing to understand is that when you buy options, you cannot lose more than the price of the option itself. In other words, your maximum loss is whatever you paid for the option.

Let's put these ideas together. When you use the language ""without exercising a contract"" by definition you are referring to option buyers. As a buyer, then, the lowest value of your option contracts, at expiration for example, is 0. 

Hope that helps

(It may be illuminating to note that exercising options is not typical for most traders)",gwws1vq,t3_n4f7ns
2754,1620101832.0,,,,,The lowest value it goes is .01,gwvbv75,t3_n4f7ns

2756,1620143682.0,,,,,As long as you're not trading on margin you shouldn't have a negative account. Trading on margin is when you trade with borrowed money. DO NOT DO THAT.  For options the most you can lose is what ever the price of the option was.,gwx4y14,t3_n4f7ns

2760,1620072631.0,n45zqn,So I began investing in January of this year. Buying what I could here and there. I buy typically between 100 and 150 shares a week of the same stock. Will the long term capital gains clock start on my first purchase of the stock back in January? Or will it be a year from each purchase of the same stock?,Trying to figure out capital gains tax for multiple buys of the same stock,7.0,,,
2761,1620077370.0,,,,,"There are separate clocks for each purchase. Long/short term duration is calculated on a per share basis.

2768,1620079517.0,,,,,Wash sale is sell for a \_loss\_ and buy back within 30 days actually.   You can sell at a profit all you want (and yes the gains are based on how long you held).  The Wash Sale Rule exists to prevent  gaming your realized \_losses\_.,gwu3ky4,t1_gwtyzpp

2770,1620061902.0,n41ivh,,Bid-Ask Spread Definition - Investopedia,111.0,,,
2771,1620062993.0,,,,,I think the asking price is the minimum a seller of a stock would accept.. and the Bid is the most a buyer would pay for the said stock... the Bid-Ask spread is the difference between those two numbers.. the smaller the spread is the more liquidity the stock or option has and the larger the spread the less liquidity.. I’m not a professional advisor. I am just a guy.,gwt19ko,t3_n41ivh

2773,1620072787.0,,,,,I think a lack of understanding of the bid/ask is one of the most common issues I see when people new to options ask questions. It's hugely important to know how this works and what you're getting into if you are trying to buy/sell options that don't have a lot of volume.,gwtodm5,t3_n41ivh

If I place a sell at .39 it moves the entire spread from .39 ask and the bid moves up. The price of the option then moves down from .37 to .36 then up to .38 and the spread then changes to .36 bid to .41 ask - what’s going on here??!",gwu2jyu,t3_n41ivh

But can we 👏 PLEASE 👏 talk about this crazy spike in my all time chart? Glitch or what????!!!",gwu0a9c,t3_n41ivh
2776,1620085009.0,,,,,"The best way to think of this is to imagine the NYSE 100
Years ago.  You have a room full of buyers and sellers all yelling over each other to either buy at the lowest possible or sell at the highest.  Within this, buyers are trying to outbid each other while sellers are trying to undercut each other, depending on their determination or necessity to sell and buy.  This is where the bid- ask spread comes from.  This is also why the more people participating in the trading of a stock, the closer the bid/ask of that underlying becomes.  Market makers are essentially doing this in real time.  This is also why, although virtually all trading is done on a computer, we still operate by the same market hours we always have.  Without the most people possible participating in the market at the same time, prices can become unclear and you very likely will get ripped off.",gwuf7g5,t3_n41ivh

2779,1620085282.0,,,,,"While I agree you should understand where the bid ask comes from, it’s shouldn’t prevent you from trading options.  Start above the mid and work your way down until you get filled.  If your looking to get filled quickly start below the mid.  Whether or not the debit/ credit is worth the option you’re trading is always subjective to that person",gwufs24,t1_gwtodm5
2780,1620087488.0,,,,,"Need more info. The open interest isn’t as important as the volume on the day and the number of contracts you are trading. Once your sell order fills, the bid will go to whatever bids are out there. Spreads on options are totally different than stocks. If you’re trading something that has limited volume, the spread will be wide AF",gwukdjk,t1_gwu2jyu
2781,1620102019.0,,,,,I think some traders use bots or automatic api connection to automatically match the lowest ask. I noticed when I went from $1.80 a contract all the way to $.30 a contract and the same 18 contracts kept following my price change instantly. If I don’t see them follow I cancel my order and boom the 18 contracts were $.05 above my price,gwvc63d,t1_gwu2jyu
2782,1620102142.0,,,,,Also your example to me is more that the price will always average out between the bid and ask so when the new ask is lower that the last the price will be even lower than that due to averaging out between the bid and the ask,gwvcd9l,t1_gwu2jyu
2783,1620092830.0,,,,,And I have $2.30 in my checking account but transfered $1000 to Robinhood. Is that a problem and why is Robinhood at fault?,gwuvdwc,t1_gwu0a9c

2789,1620063810.0,,,,," Hello, I have never had a job or needed to pay taxes so I have very little idea of how to do it in general. 

I have bought and sold cryptocurrency in around $100-$150 increments, 12 total transactions counting buying and selling on robinhood and made maybe $5 at most in the past few days. I was just bored sitting on my phone buying and selling as it went up and down a few cents, I did not do enough research and just did not think about it from a tax perspective.

I know it seems petty but I am concerned about what that will do to me tax wise as I assume I will now have to file for the first time and for such a small amount earned.

The right time to finish a position and take a profit is subjective. What you shouldn't do is get greedy. Greed has taken many users for their wealth on this sub. Any profit is good profit.

One other note is that you should invest to build wealth not to pay for cancer.
This is purely an example, suppose your treatment costs $1000 and you have all of your capital in one investment. You make a good trade and it increases in value to 900. You wait until it reaches $1000. But then it decreases in value to 700 and never reaches 900 again.

As for an exit strategy, that's really something you need to figure out on your own and then just commit to. It sounds like you want to take out your initial investment, are you comfortable doing that now, or are you hoping to utilize it to make more profit before taking it out? When I make an investment I commit to not needing that money again for a long time. When I take profits I never really take profits, I exit a position at a profit and then roll that into a new investment. Being in your 50s it makes sense that you might be more on the side of things where you're looking to cash out some of the profits and use them.

2849,1620003608.0,,,,,"Depends on your risk tolerance. I’m going to assume since you have a substantial savings yet only invested $500 you are either skeptical about stocks or full of shit. I’ll assume the former and we can infer low risk is what you’re looking for at this time due to small starting position. My suggestion is look into “Boomer” stocks. These are stocks like coca-cola, Ford, AT&T, and GE. You won’t see much growth but they have been around forever and can protect your wealth by always being around. If you aren’t so sure about managing your own stocks, valuations, or intrinsic value I’d suggest starting with mutual funds or ETF’s (exchange traded funds). Most mutual funds require a minimum purchase, can only purchase at a set time of day (regardless if it’s the best value for the stocks involved), they are managed by a person or persons, they invest in multiple stocks at once, and have fees with no guarantee of progress. ETF’s are traded on the stock market like stock, they invest in multiple stocks chosen by a person or computer algorithm, the time of purchase is the same time as market hours, they have little to no fee, some ETF’s use leverage which can be dangerous, and generally ETF’s based on indexes are the safest. ETF’s based on index’s like $SPY or $VOO or $QQQ are safe bets. This is since the market established in the late 1800’s it’s had growth. $SPY has an average growth rate of 8% since inception. If you are nearing retirement you might want to lower your risk by moving out of stock positions and into bonds. Both of these markets reflect one another. For specific stock recommendations you should speak with a financial advisor considering your experience level and available funds an advisor would help greatly. Lastly a ROTH IRA can help grow your wealth with stocks. Downsides are you can only invest $6k a year and you can’t take out until your retirement age. The pro’s will tell you put all of your $1000 into one investment because you wouldn’t choose a bad stock to invest in and diversified portfolios are for idiots. I will say I’m not a trading genius so my dumbass has a portfolio diversified over multiple sectors using individual stocks, cryptos, and ETF’s.

You have plenty of time as long as you don't waste 1p years trying to ""get rich quick""  It also requires cool-headedness. When people are panicking you are looking for buying opportunities, when people are riding high on a single stock, you continue to diversify.

Invest in companies you believe in for the long term, hold on for the ride and add when you beliefs are stronger than ever. Look at market Cap to determine a company's size.

If you plan to continue adding money to this like a retirement fund then you can buy VOO, VTI, SPY, etc, but if this $1000 is for you to  actively trade, then find some stocks you believe in and get your feet wet. $1000 isn’t going to get you far gains wise unless you mess with options, and that very well may be what you do if this is fun money and you don’t care if it disappears.

I joined a bunch of relevant subreddits and will watch the stocks being talked about - not to necessarily buy, but to be able to start picking. Otherwise it’s like letter soup right? Easier to have suggestions and go look them all up from there. Also I try to pay attention to things I like - a year ago AMC was struggling and experts thought they might go broke. AMC is what I’d consider the best chain in the US and I love going to the movies. Even though I’m high risk and can’t get to the movies still for a while, they’re wonderful. I put a little money in there... and over time more and sold some and did it again. I still have like 11 shares I may just never sell at this rate haha. I also love Disney and in spite of them having similar issues, dumped a bit into them too. With excellent results. Anyway my point is you can think about what you normally do or need and where YOU spend money to get inspiration for stocks to check out and possibly buy into. If you’re not into tech but recognize that it’s an area with lots of potential, do your research on ETFs or simply go for long term S&P stuff. You’re likely to trend up if you spread out your money across things that naturally tend to trend up anyway. 

Oh and, if something isn’t performing well, you will need to recognize when to cut losses and when to wait.

Also keep $5 free to do reverse split arbitrage. Sometimes a company will announce that 10 shares will now be consolidated into 1 share, which has the effect of increasing the price per share about 10x. (The exact ratio may differ.) So if you had 10 shares before the split, you'd now have 1 share that's worth ten times as much. That's a reverse split.

If you only had 1 share going in, you'd have 1/10 of a share after, a fraction which historically could not be traded. To get around fractional shares, companies will sometimes pay you the cash value of the fractional share. Other times, though, they will round you up to one full share. When they round up, the share you had bought for $0.50 is now worth around $5. You profit $4.50 with almost no risk.

This counts as the core of your long-term strategy and should effect what choices you make in your taxable account. The next question is how much time will you spend monitoring your investments. This effects what kind of strategies you will want to employ. You also need to determine how much risk you are willing to take. 

Do some reading on different strategies; pick one that sounds like it will fit. Which one doesn't really matter. There are tons of ways to make money in the market, each different strategy will work better in different market environments. Put a small amount of money in and practice.

EBAY
currently $55.99
sell - 14th May - $56.00 - Put 1x100 -$1.16 - $116.00
buy -14th May - $53.00 - Put 1x100 - $0.26 - $-26.00
Total	$90.00 credit

My profit matrix looks like this (link to Options Profit Calculator):
http://opcalc.com/u6D

$90 is my maximum profit for this option trade which is fine for me.

Can I get some feedback if this is the best spread option to apply? (as opposed to a CALL CREDIT spread, iron condor or any other option programs). Are these the optimal expiration dates and strike values to maximize my profit with as little risk as possible?

Brand new Robinhood user here so please be kind!",Need feedback on Put Credit Spread,21.0,,,
2903,1619982930.0,,,,,"Everyone has their own strategy and yours is fine. Here's how I look at it. 

With bull puts I don't think much about the stock going higher. I look for ones that I don't think will go lower. So imo Ebay is a good pick. 

Also, because I'm not looking for it to go up, I sell weeklies. Less time for it to go bad, faster time decay.

Then I focus on the break-even point I want. I look at the second lowest resistance level and see if I can find a risk/profit balance around that. With Ebay first resistance is around 55.30, second is about 54.88.

When it comes to picking strikes, I like both to be out-of-the-money with a few strikes between them. The larger spread gives you a lower profit %, but it makes the profit/loss slope longer, giving you more time to decide when to bail if it starts going bad. 

So for Ebay, I would be inclined to pick something like May 7th 55.50/51.50. With the chart I'm looking at that would be max gain 0.53, max loss 3.47. Break even at 54.97. But the profit of 15.27% is a bit low for me so I probably wouldn't do it. 

If I base it off your expected break-even of 55.10, then I would probably pick May 7 55.5/54. BE @ 55.12, 33.93% profit, max profit 0.35, max loss 1.12, probability of profit 60%. Then I'd sell 14 pairs for a credit of 490.

Again this is my current personal way of picking bull credit spreads. It's quite conservative and short-term. In this case Ebay doesn't quite fit my criteria, but it's close and maybe going out two more weeks would make it look better, but I thought it would be helpful to walk through my thought process. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how to pick your spreads with more confidence. 

Final thoughts - see what the sentiment is Monday and if it looks like it hit resistance. Also take a look at more expensive tickers so you don't have to sell as many to get a decent return amount.",gwp7424,t3_n3b99t

You can reinvest with instant funds, but selling again before those funds have settled is a no-no. This isn't a brokeage's rule, it's based on the Federal Reserve Board's regulation T.

If you don't have margin and you buy stocks with the unsettled proceeds of another sale, you'll get a freeriding violation (and usually have your account locked) if you sell them again before the funds from the prior sale have settled.",gwgj155,t3_n1vszr

Being that it takes if I’m not mistaken 72 hours for the funds to settle, by setting a certain amount of money to spend each day, you allow yourself the ability to continuously buy and sell every day of the week without running into any violations. For example if you had $900 that you were going to invest, you could use $300 on Monday, then $300 on Tuesday, and then $300 on Wednesday. By doing this in theory you should be able buy and sell on each one of those days, and by doing so you’ll allow yourself to have funds available while you’re waiting for the proceeds from your initial sale on Monday to settle.

It’s basically a pile of money sitting on a table. If you came home to a pile of money sitting on a table would you call up your dad and ask him what you’re supposed to do with it?

I didn't want to complicate my answer with this additional detail, but I should have added it to the ""things to look up"".   

From wikipedia:

""The main difference between a [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) violation and free riding is the eventual deposit of funds to cover the buy. In free riding the buyer sells the security without ever depositing the funds to pay for the initial purchase.

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) considers a good faith violation an ""abuse of credit"" and requires the broker keep track of them. If the trader gets three violations in one year, the broker is required to restrict the account. This is compared to the free riding violation which results in an automatic restriction.",gwjlpnb,t1_gwgj155

3121,1619848166.0,,,,,"When I first started trading I was upset by the 25k thing as I sat and watched multiple/different tickers jump 30% in a day, going “look how much I could make if I was able to jump in on just 10% of the run 5 times instead of 3 each week, or even 20 times. Boo no fair”. However, for the poorer investors like myself we struggle with not being greedy and wanting 15% or more. And we miss the the top and it drops quicker than we think it will and oh snap I’m DOWN 10% bail! Then a few minutes later it’s going back up and we jump back in to try to ride it again, but wait it was false. Down another 10%. The ticker is still up 10% on the day, which is good for anyone who was in before the day. But you’re down 20%. Dodge is a great example. I like dodge and do believe it is just getting started. However; on your next day off, take X amount of money you feel like flushing down the toilet, and try to make 40% on the day just jumping in and out in and out. Most likely, you might break even but probably not. It helps us poor guys more than we know. Just my 2 cents. Now why that rule is in place? Idk but I’m personally okay with it.",gwii338,t1_gwgmxmb

You could replace it with a detailed licensing exam required to open an account, but that would severely impact business. So instead you can do stupid stuff freely, as long as you’ve got enough money for it to be worth the brokers time to field your confused calls.",gwguqc4,t1_gwgsh8u

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

3166,1619679124.0,n0ypiz,"I am fine creating stop loss/limit orders on stocks and one-leg options but get confused setting stop loss/limit orders on credit and debit spreads on RH. I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

A nice safe stock will get you a 10% rate of return to get you to $100K in 46 years. I'm assuming you have a much faster target time frame. That means higher return and that means much higher risk.


So I'll assume you're looking for at least a 20X if not 50X or 100X return in 1-2 years.

It's about 1 step away from taking $1000 to Vegas, or just buying $1000 in scratch-offs. Just so you know the risks. It certainly is NOT an investment, and you should never use that word in describing what you want to do. It's a pure gamble, YOLO bet it all and let it ride type move. You'll never get there by buying/selling a little bit along the way trying to work up to $100K starting with $1000 in a few years. Because if you could, you'd be retired from professional trading by now, and would own your own hedge fund. 


You only have $1,000 and are not a professional trader so you have to bet big and let it ride.  Dogecoin was less than a penny on Jan 1, 2021. Dogecoin, on average in April, had a price in pennies according to the day of April. Roughly speaking it was 5 cents on the 5th, was 20 cents on the 20th, was 30 cents today.  A 30X return since Jan 1, 2021.  It's probably exactly the gamble you're looking for. Big risk, big reward. Put in a buy limit order for $1000 worth of doge at 30 cents and you can hold it until it hits $10 and buy your $100,000+ race car.  Edit: Broke up the wall of text",gwgfjsr,t3_n0raqu

3206,1619638866.0,n0mz1n,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part— Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won’t. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I’m tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren’t required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone’s advice works and I get my money back, I’d be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that’s legal. 

tl:dr I believe Robinhood violated my rights when it sold my crypto after the order officially cancelled and restored to my account, and do not know how to proceed",Securities Sold without Permission,22.0,,,

And lastly, when you buy crypto on Robinhood, you don’t actually own the coins, you own a fraction of a pool of coins in a larger wallet. I hate to say this, but I think you have to take the L and learn the lesson: if you want control over your securities/crypto, you need to own it, and Robinhood isn’t the place to own either because neither ever become yours when you trade on their platform.

Business owners regularly forego taking any form of compensation in the interest of the business they operate. As the holder of a non-dividend stock you are effectively that type of owner. Contingencies on holding that share are the board or whoever is tasked with handling the business finance get to make that decision for you. 

If all stocks paid divdends it would normalize share prices, PEs would converge, and prospecting/speculating would be at least inhibited if not impossible. This would likely hinder innovation and stagnate the financial markets. 

If you think there is only value in receiving a dividend, only invest in companies with a stable dividend. 

It is entirely rational, and even ethical, for the end goal of a corporation to not be dividend distribution. In fact, paying a dividend is a strategy to retain shareholders when innovation and growth have stagnated but the company is cash positive. Basically you have all this cash and nothing left to justifiably (or unjustifiably) spend it on; wages are competitive or even industry leading (or at least employee retention is good) so you distribute it to the shareholders. 

Shareholders get paid last almost always. Companies which are not cash positive but continue to pay a dividend have decided to ski a slippery slope that ends in bankruptcy.",gw7dxqe,t3_n0jx5i
3236,1619648868.0,,,,,"I agree with a lot of what is said here but let me go a bit more in-depth:

You start a business with some savings you have. You are going from nothing to HOPEFULLY something, but at the beginning you are (hopefully) pumping all of your money back into the company and not taking pay (because you have to innovate, advertise, scale, build inventory, etc.). 

At some point you become somewhat successful but you still aren’t taking any pay, and the company still isn’t turning a profit. You really need investors to help you scale faster and faster and hit critical mass to where you are cash flow positive. You find a VC that loves your company and they give you $$$ for, say, 20% of the company. 

So the VC works with you and you scale and become cash flow positive and now you can afford to pay yourself a small salary but the VC still doesn’t take any money out. At some point you and the VC want to go public to allow investors to buy shares and for you to cash out some from your hard work. You go public, your company trades on the market, and you are happy. 

Nothing has changed. Instead of you and the VC being the only owners, you now have millions of owners. The company is still growing however. Now that you are public ally traded your have a fiduciary duty to manage the firm to the best benefit of your shareholders. As a growth company you are growing 20% YOY, which clearly means the best use of your money is reinvesting in the company to keep growing and making your shares more valuable, thereby returning value to your shareholders. 

At some point you become SO SUCCESSFUL that you are just a cash generating MACHINE. You literally can’t find investments for the cash your company has. (Think of Apple here...which is almost exactly what happened with Apple). At the point where you and your management team can’t create a reasonable return by reinvesting the money into the company (R&D, M&A, etc) then you can return capital to shareholders and allow them to reallocate that money to other profitable investments themselves.

You can sell the option whenever for the current market price, which is a function of the stock price, the time to expiration, and the stock's volatility. At expiration, the value is the difference between the stock's market price and the call's strike price.

3306,1619619612.0,n0fv4o,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

This was for all users in our department, it gave use the ability to see everything about the banking customers: Name, address, SS, balances, transactions, other authorized users, etc. 

Everything we did was tracked and such, but since we were all using the same username there was no way to know which one of us in the department was responsible for which tasks. Lucky for the bank, none of us in our department ever thought to use the info with bad intentions.

So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

3400,1619557890.0,,,,,"If the stock does not pay dividends then you have to pay it back in full. 

My strategy for using margin is based upon dividends and future value of a stock. I started to use margin in about 2007 to gain wealth. Bought and shopped  great top stocks, mutual funds, REIT that would pay me a dividend monthly. Even though stocks pay quartly, common stocks will pay for the margin for example: Jan. April, July, Oct as another stock may pay Feb. May. Aug. Nov. As another March, June, Sept. Dec...so  instead of reinvesting those dividends use the dividends to pay part of your margin. Yet plan to sell part of your shares when the value of the stocks reaches peak in some future years. 

I use Morning Star to research but you can use the Yahoo Financial. I as of today I use spreadsheet to keep track of those dividends, value, interest.",gw3j7sd,t3_mzmmp9

3403,1619568589.0,,,,,A good rule of thumb is to never gamble more than what you can afford to lose.,gw45jdg,t3_mzmmp9
3404,1619539610.0,,,,,"i have my $1k of free margin in $QYLD, earning a safe 12% dividend which gets paid out monthly. look into it. with that being said, every expert i’ve asked has advised me that this is a bad idea and that you should only use your own money (despite how safe $QYLD is)",gw2by98,t3_mzmmp9
3405,1619548130.0,,,,,"Yeah, you add money and once it settles, it’s deducted from your margin balance. 

So you use 1000 in margin, add 800, once it clears the next day likely, maybe 2-3, your margin will then show 200. 

And even if you have the money elsewhere, say everything is cut in half tomorrow at open, it’s not going to give you time to pay. Once you hit your margin maintenance level, it’s going to start selling stocks till you’re below it, likely the higher requirement, riskier assets first.",gw2wabd,t3_mzmmp9
3406,1619525853.0,,,,,"Here's the thing margin can force you to sell at a bad price where as cash you can buy it can dip and enable margin to buy the dip. Also margin doesn't work unless you have $2,000 in your account already",gw1ir8x,t3_mzmmp9
3407,1619546734.0,,,,,With such an elementary understanding of margin you should stay far far far away. Go back to trading GME,gw2syv9,t3_mzmmp9
3408,1619541355.0,,,,,"There is no free money, no one is going to pay your bills for you.  Borrow money and you pay interest.  Take out a margin loan and you may get a margin call that wipes out your account.  You are not smarter than the system, LOL",gw2g3mv,t3_mzmmp9

3410,1619530642.0,,,,,They are not promoting (nor do you see a lot of) margin over there though..,gw1rj98,t1_gw1ic9f
3411,1619541205.0,,,,,Well... yes and no. They’re betting you’re going to use margin to buy stocks. They’re basically making you pay them a dividend to use their money with very little risk a stock will collapse in relation to their income (aka margin requirement used to manage their risk),gw2fqvx,t1_gw23ton
3412,1619541422.0,,,,,"To add to this great advice, you don’t wanna invest anyone’s money but your own, especially if you’re on the newer side. Between tax liabilities and potential losses, you don’t wanna owe anyone else, especially if you don’t have much to invest in the first place

Some of the big CryptoTwitter influencers will flex their margin skills, but they have all explained that they started with money they were willing to lose, and many of them got liquidated (100% loss to pay back the margin debt) or lost 90% or so very early on, before they got to their current positions.

If this is money you can’t afford to lose, then you shouldn’t be investing it in things as risky as crypto or, some would even say not to put it in stocks. But if this is money you’re prepared to lose, then that’s a tougher decision you have to make, whether you’re truly prepared to lose it or something less",gw2g9n6,t1_gw23ton
3413,1619556587.0,,,,,"Uh no, it’s not like the casino, you’re not playing stocks against Robinhood. Margin at any significant level definitely have interest. It’s similar to taking a loan from you bank but it’s less risky for the lender because they have your stocks as collateral. Using margin has its risk but can be pretty effective. The odds are pretty good if you just look at the last 10 years. Margin can also give you cash flow during dips to buy more shares if you don’t want to sell other positions.",gw3g7wy,t1_gw23ton
3414,1619610067.0,,,,,"Only a fool and a sith thinks in absolutes. Margin is just a tool. Use it incorrectly and you can get hurt... but it’s not some kind of toxic self harm. 

Too many people follow traditional old school investing tropes which basically were written in the same book that you should be 50/50 stock bonds. 

Sure.. and I’ll walk 5 miles to work too. Get real.",gw5t2o9,t1_gw23ton

Appreciate your answer",gw4met9,t1_gw3vqld
3419,1619610414.0,,,,,"Finally someone with clarity. Margin is perfectly fine if your gains outpace your margin interest. And you have the cash on hand to depo in case anything goes wrong. 

People act like margin is a toxic death pill. They’re just misinformed and ignorant.",gw5tkp2,t1_gw3vqld

3422,1619549686.0,,,,,"Thanks, and this is where I need to do research more.

I am just planning on using margin to accelerate my ETF purchases. Since these aren't very voilatle. I figured I wouldn't really have to worry about the margin being called if I didn't leverage to much.

Yet, that part about transferring money and it not clearing in time scares me. I use RH and get instant access, but it sounds like from your reply it has to actual clear.

It's been taking a week or so to clear lately.",gw2zyth,t1_gw2wabd
3423,1619610282.0,,,,,"That’s so very unlikely tho. I hate these kind of “what about xyz” events that almost never ever happen. 

What if the market tumbles 90%. Then I’m way less worried about my $1000 and more worried about the world ending.",gw5tds3,t1_gw2wabd
3424,1619527052.0,,,,,"Ya, I have well over 2K in my account. I just want to use it to advance my ETF buys. So, no real big worry about huge dips. 

I just want to earn the 1K also. If I use the 1K, and then deposit $500 cash in my account. Am I back to 1K of margin interest-free?",gw1krv2,t1_gw1ir8x

3428,1619539898.0,,,,,"They originally advertised it as paying $5 for L2 data from NASDAQ (which is [$15/month](https://data.nasdaq.com/BookViewer.aspx) but useless when none of the free firms sends orders to the NASDAQ for execution) and access to Morningstar reports (which are utterly useless in general but another [$199/year](https://www.morningstar.com/memberships)). Robinhood forgot their users are typically too stupid to even notice that bid and ask prices exist much less depth of the book, won't use either of the above listed 'perks', and just want to have access to more money to lose.",gw2cmnb,t1_gw295jw
3429,1619553011.0,,,,,"No, last payment was $0.228 and the stock price is $22.62 and the stock pays monthly. Nasdaq even lists it as 12.1% on their website. You can’t trust the Robinhood information listed as it can be wildly inaccurate, it lists no dividend to REML but this month it paid out something like $0.19

I don’t know if it is just monthly dividends like QYLD and REML or all, but I don’t buy anything using the in app information for my purchase information anymore.",gw37x83,t1_gw2em7m

3431,1619553478.0,,,,,"I must be missing something here too. Say you bought in at $18/share. You own 55 shares, last reported dividend was $.22, so each month you’d gain ~$12. So you’d need around x3 the dividend amount for it to cover interest, monthly premium fee & make a baby profit.",gw391sw,t1_gw2em7m
3432,1619538362.0,,,,,I use margin to buy VTI in advance to give it more time to grow. You pay back margin when you sell or when you deposit money.,gw28z85,t1_gw1krv2

Am I missing an thing else? Thxs",gw4lm7i,t1_gw2cmnb
3436,1619565508.0,,,,,"$12 dollars minus $5 is $7. So $7 more than the gold fee for $1000, remember there isn’t interest on that first $1000. Not much in this case but a profit nonetheless. Perhaps you are confusing the 1% monthly rate of QYLD against the 2.5% annual rate of Robinhood but, 1% per month is more than 2.5% per year.",gw3zea6,t1_gw391sw
3437,1619544425.0,,,,,"I mean that's what my thoughts is. I guess me big question is if say I use $500 margin to VTI and next week deposit $1000.

Will this clear up the $500 margin and give me $500 cash? 

Or is the only way to close out a margin is to sell said ETF shares purchased on margin?

I'm not stupid and going to be buying growth stocks or crypto with margin.

I just want a little extra leverage in-between cash deposits. If it's there, I have a good chance coming out ahead by years end with this strategy with minimal risk.

3463,1619491791.0,mzet57,Dumb question. I know if I try to sell a stock with stops in place I have to cancel them before I can make the sale.

Also would that replace the free three stocks for referring or go on top?,What's the deal with the crypto bonus?,0.0,,,
3465,1619484434.0,,,,,"No idea besides what some folks have posted with their referral links. Apparently, they need to trade crypto. No clue about how much or if a buck is enough. Who knows?

3469,1619471717.0,mz88hr,"I have a question with regards to how liquid Robinhood truly is. For instances, what’s the highest any account can get and you still have a peace of mind with being secure?

I’ve seen post about people have millions on their accounts, so that has made me feel better. But what about $100’th of millions? Like how well are our accounts backed? I just want to rest assure that if I hit a huge trade that I am backed. Crypto is something completely different and I understand that. This is in regards to stocks. 

For an example, if GameStop goes to a million a share (this is an example only), will I be guaranteed that I can SELL and my sort to speak, tendies be guaranteed?

So ignoring whether GME will hit infinity/share-- just hypothetically:

IF a stock hits $1M+ per share, WILL Robinhood:

A) Allow us to sell our shares  
B) Be able to pay us for said shares?

Poof money is available i do it all the time.,gvztwv7,t3_mz5fmw
3509,1619538132.0,,,,,"I think you get it now based on the comments. In case you don't:

Imagine you go to the store and you write a check to pay for groceries. And then you forget and buy a PS5 and then have no money in your bank account. The grocery store just got screwed over by you when the check bounces right - you just stole groceries. The grocery store may now say ""hey from now on if you write a check you have to guarantee there's enough to pay for it"". This is what's happening with Robinhood, and all brokers.

Let's use the broker now. If you have $500 with them, let's say Robinhood, and you want to buy a stock for $200 and another stock for $150. When you place the order for the first stock worth $200 let's assume no one else is selling, so there's an open order you've placed for $200 for 1 stock. When you go to place the order for the second stock, your available balance you can use will be $300 (the 500 minus the 200 for the open order). Why? Well if you say place an order for 3 of the $150 stock AND it goes through, that's like you buying the PS5. You'll have spent $450 and only have $50 left, now that first order for $200 you can't actually afford it, Robinhood doesn't want to be the grocery store (no brokers do). Now if someone else now accepts your order for the first stock worth $200 who pays for it? You certainly can't you only have $50 left. To avoid this, while you have the open order for the first stock worth $200, if you try to place another order your available balance will be $300 to make sure you can pay for the first set of groceries. So no, Robinhood didn't ""take"" your money. Your money's locked away for the order until either the order goes through or you cancel it.",gw28fuf,t3_mz5fmw
3510,1619545302.0,,,,,I went to the drive through at McDonald's and they took my money at the first window but didn't give me any burgers. I just drove off. I wonder what happens at the second window. What a scam,gw2pjci,t3_mz5fmw

3515,1619586285.0,,,,,"If you placed a limit order, then your purchase will not be processed until the price of Dogecoin reaches the limit you set. 

So let’s say you place your limit at .25 USD per Dogecoin... and you pay Robinhood $1,000.00 for this limit order...
If Dogecoin is currently priced at .269 USD per Dogecoin, you aren’t going to see the $1,000.00 in your buying power because you cannot use it. It is essentially queued up waiting for 1 Dogecoin to fall to .25 USD and if it does and there are available sellers, THEN your $1,000.00 is spent on the Dogecoin and you will see it reflected on your account.

You can cancel a limit order at any time before your limit set is reached... *and* it will automatically be cancelled after a certain amount of time anyway if the price never drops to your set limit.

But keep in mind, if the price **does** drop to .25 USD per Dogecoin... your money will be spent if sellers are available (and there will be most likely lol) and then your money is invested and there’s no going back. Then you are playing the Doge game! Lmfao. Until you decide to sell of course. In that case you will get back whatever returns you have on the Dogecoin, be it negative or positive... **and** this is assuming someone wants to buy your Dogecoin. So don’t set a limit price too low. Because then you’re pretty much setting up an automatic buy-in in the event of the collapse of Dogecoin LOL. Be reasonable with your limits.",gw51cxk,t3_mz5fmw

**-Why ETF's-**

The truth is, 89% of fund managers fail to beat the market.

According to this report, 88.99% of large-cap US funds have underperformed the S&P500 index over ten years. Knowing this, why do we as individual investors still try to beat the market as opposed to ETF investing? Overconfidence perhaps? Not sure. My main investment is SPY leaps but besides that I have one other secret ETF that has made me very rich...

**-Why investing in a water(liquid gold) ETF could make you rich!-**

I've spent hours upon hours scouring the web for an ETF that I feel could reliably beat the S&P 500 consistently and I think I've found one(two actually). PHO and FIW, two etf's focused on water conservation and infrastructure.

About 70% of the earth's surface is covered in water, but 97% of it is saltwater, which is unfit for human use. Saltwater cannot be used for drinking, crop irrigation, or most industrial uses. Of the remaining 3% of the world's water resources, only about 1% is readily available for human consumption. This creates a demand for desalination infrastructure to solve the global water crisis as the population of the world rapidly rises by the day.

I was watching a TED talk that said in the future, wars will be waged over water. It simply isn't easy to transport and some areas have a lot more than others. For example, everything from steel to potato chips to computers uses water in the production. Did you know that we use 2400 liters of water to produce just one hamburger?

In fact, water futures were created last December because of the growing interest in water investing. If you look at the 13F filings on Whalewisdom you can see that water is also one of the fastest growing sectors among hedge funds.

**-The Big Short-**

I don't know if you guys remember, but Michael Burry said at the end of The Big Short that he is focused only on investing into water. The more due diligence I do on water(Ted talks, books, articles) the more I realize just how right Michael Burry is about this. Michael Burry is also investing in Farmland, along with Bill Gates who is now the world's biggest farmland owner. In addition, water will benefit from the imminent rising inflation due to the fed's QE. After all, it's an essential commodity.

**-Can't be replaced-**

Unlike tech companies which may go out of favor, water will always be essential and relevant to our lives. As the population of the world increases, tendies will flow into our pockets. I almost see this as a no-lose scenerio. Desalination is a necessity, there's no other way around it. The population growth creates the demand, and a growing population is easier to rely on than trying to anticipate consumer demand for something like Apple!

**-Very cheap leaps-**

As of now, you can get $5200 worth of leaps options on PHO for $200-300. Considering this has been rapidly outperforming the SPY, this is a tremendous bargain! FIW is actually better than PHO when you consider performance, however the options are less liquid. I would recommend FIW if you can find a decent price, otherwise PHO should suit you fine.

**-Conclusion-**

I'd advise everyone to do their own research. There's some fancy graphs and TED talk videos on Youtube. Blackrock and other top ETF's know about water and are highly invested. This ETF is one

of the secrets to my success for the last few years(the other being poor man's covered call on certain stable/fed-backed ETF's under low volatility). Other commodity/real estate etf's are also worth looking into(DBA, WOOD, DBC, REIT's) as an inflation hedge and for diversification.

My retirement $$$ is in my boring retirement Vanguard acct... set and forget. My joy is meandering through the stock market  generally buying longterm at least for 1 year due to tax implications. But most held for a lot longer.

For me I don't want it to become a job or stress me out. I want to learn and I want it to be fun. I jumped into Bitcoin and held for a long time and cashed out with a tidy profit to do something else. My husband has his own money and we have much different styles. But I jumped into dogecoin with my brother as a sibling type rivalry thing and it gave us something in common and something to rib each other about. He bowed out. I sold enough to cover taxes and my cost and I'm up $1,800. Even if I lose the rest, I really didn't lose. I'll sell a bit more if it goes to $0.50 and let the rest ride. Sister is coming out on top!

 I still have single shares of some stocks because I was too poor to buy more and it feels good to see 1 share of NVIDIA purchased @ $89...  it's like looking back at your kindergarden photos, I also have 21 shares of NVAX @ $4.47, 14 shares of SQ @$15... wish I had bought more but it is what it is.

With meme stocks it pays to buy them before the craze. I bought dogecoin at .069420 because I thought it was funny and because it had been stagnant for a while.

As another example, I bought Amazon after they announced they're acquiring Whole Foods because their stock remained stagnant at just under $1000 for weeks after the news and I had a feeling that the newly added value would be recognized eventually.

As a third example I bought some weed stocks recently such as YOLO. They're down about 33% - I bought at 30, it's at 20 - but I have a good feeling that they'll come back up in the long run.

Anyway I'd personally use a source of information other than trading platforms for my larger bets, because the fact that a security is being highlighted usually means the market is already in the midst of an adjustment that you missed out on.",gvyqan9,t1_gvyov9i

Standard deduction is basically an amount you subtract from your income before calculating taxes. For federal 2020 it’s like $12,400. So if you make $3000 then $3000-$12400 is less than $0 so no tax!

3761,1619472093.0,,,,,"Taxable income = short term salary income + short term capital gains from <1 year stock position + long term capital gains from >1 year stock position.

Taxable income determines whether your long term gains is taxed at 0% or 15%. Fed taxes is zero for the first 40k of long term capital gains. 

I didn't make any money from a job last year. So, my taxable income = 0 + 0 +  long term capital gains of 40k.

Let's use an example of someone with 35K salary, 2k stock short term gains and 10k long term gains

The salary and stock short term gains will be taxed like normal income. This amounts to 37k. Now you have space for $3k worth of long term capital gains left. 

The first 3k will be taxed at 0%, while the next 7k will be taxed at 15%.

In other words, there's actually an incentive in the Fed Taxation rule for you to avoid realizing short term gains or have a regular job.

A jobless retiree with a massive portfolio of stocks can just slowly sell off 40K of stocks every year for your living expense with zero fed tax, and zero state tax (assuming you live in a tax free state). Also, this 40k number keeps increasing by a few hundred dollars too. Use that free money and live in a 3rd world country where expenses are 1/10 of the US.

3862,1619660359.0,,,,,"""Why can't you use SMS?""

It's shocking how many people are under the impression that SMS is secure.  It's not; not in any way, shape or form.

If you use SMS/texts, then essentially everyone on the entire SS7 network can see your messages.  It's like sending unsecured packets over the internet, it's just a stupid thing to do.  NO ONE should be using SMS for security purposes!

There is an argument that it's better than nothing, but even that is questionable because being lulled into a false sense of security might very well be worse, because then you let your guard down \*thinking\* you're secure when you're not.  

Are you better off or worse off having a screen door if a burglar comes to your home?  If you don't have a screen door, you're far more likely to have your front door closed and locked.  If you have a screen door then you may very well lock the screen door, but because it's not really secure, it's not protecting you.

2FA is a great idea.  2FA over SMS is a \*terrible\* idea.  The only reason it's being used is because nearly everyone has a phone number that can receive texts and they know how to find them.  It's laziness on the part of banks and financial organizations.",gw8vfza,t3_mx2fvy

Wanted to head people’s thoughts on Impossible Foods, Oatly, and Warby Parker going public in the near future. As a consumer, I’m obsessed with the brands, but I wanted to hear from the community about their potential and if you’re buying. Thanks!","Thoughts on Impossible Foods, Oatly, and Warby Parker IPOs?",184.0,,,
4019,1619041772.0,,,,,"I think Impossible foods is going to be a big one, the adoption rate of the product is outstanding, almost all major food chains have a variety in their menu, tastes outstanding too. Oatly should be decent, it’s quite popular but doesn’t have that mass appeal yet. Warby Parker, not too sure, could go either way",gvdhsi7,t3_mvoezv
4020,1619040569.0,,,,,"Definitely buying into Impossible and Oatly. They're solid brands with tons of room for growth, and if they perform half as well as Beyond then you'll double your investment in a year. 

Not familiar with Warbly Parker.",gvdf4wl,t3_mvoezv
4021,1619040709.0,,,,,All in on impossible. I think that's a stock I'll be very happy with for a long term hold.,gvdfg2s,t3_mvoezv
4022,1619047330.0,,,,,"Impossible is going to be massive just like Beyond. The alt-meat boom is really just two years old. Expanding into more categories, geographies and lines of distribution will sustain growth. Also, the cost will closer to actual beef, thus making it an option for giant parts of food services industry, like schools. 

Warby Parker doesn’t have as much potential. It has too much competition. 

Don’t know much about Oatly.",gvdtd4k,t3_mvoezv
4023,1619040615.0,,,,,"I'll never invest in an IPO the first day after Coinbase. I guess everyone has to do it once. I'll wait and buy the dip. But, being a vegetarian that used to love meat, I'm bullish on impossible.",gvdf8mi,t3_mvoezv
4024,1619040827.0,,,,,"Impossible foods was started by a friend of mine, one of the smartest people (and good person) I’ve ever met. They’ve grown a ton and have a great vision and I have always thought it’s a pretty incredible idea. I’m sure they will crush it. As for the others I have warby glasses (on my third pair) and have been very impressed by them through the years- great customer service, easy and convenient to buy from, and even their brick and mortars are great. Oatly I like but can’t speak too much by how I see them doing long term. /not financial advise",gvdfpgt,t3_mvoezv
4025,1619049570.0,,,,,Is there a date for Impossible to ipo?,gvdxvrr,t3_mvoezv
4026,1619039704.0,,,,,Interested in Oatley. Not sure yet if oat milks are a fad.,gvdd76b,t3_mvoezv
4027,1619040902.0,,,,,"I think all of these plant-based companies going public is a sign of how consumer trends are changing.  The vegan trend began gaining traction in the 80's and was popularized by certain art and music scenes. Eventually it gained even more traction and is now becoming mainstream.

Most young people are concerned about their environmental footprint and health, and you will see more and more abstaining from meat and dairy, or at the very least, reducing their consumption considerably.  

Long term, Oatly gas it on lock.  Their Barista edition is always selling out at most supermarkets around me.  Supply isn't matching the demand currently. At least not in my area.  That says quite a bit.

I'm all in on the plant based movement. But I'm also a dumb vegan that feels he's on the right side of history, so there's that.

I also hold positions in VEGN and BYND.",gvdfvg8,t3_mvoezv

4031,1619054060.0,,,,,Expect the impossible foods IPO to be a big one based on the success of Beyond. Everyone who missed the boat on Beyond Meat’s $25.00 offering is going to jump all over this in hopes it’ll do the same.,gve6t9m,t3_mvoezv
4032,1619044660.0,,,,,"Bullish on impossible but wouldn’t be interested in any IPOs. If you but impossible hedge it short BYND. They create a natural pair and you’ll see outflows from BYND as it loses its status as the only way to play the fake meat thesis.

Warby is interesting but consumer brands are just poor investments IMO. Advertising costs eat into profits as competition chews away market share. It’s a disruptable industry given luxoticas position and Warbys growth.

Oatly I wouldn’t touch. It’ll pop and slowly bleed out as competition comes in until a General Mills type takes them out in a few years.",gvdnw27,t3_mvoezv
4033,1619056540.0,,,,,The dairy industry is dying in general. People are looking for alternatives and Oatly has a ton of room to grow in that space.,gvebq6u,t3_mvoezv
4034,1619066580.0,,,,,"I like Warby Parker as an investment because their product will always be in demand, regardless of whether the economy is up or down.  Since the days of Benjamin Franklin, people have worn eyeglasses.  Warby Parker has a great app with the ""virtual try-on"" function and their prices are reasonable.  Optical shops are ridiculously expensive if you don't have insurance, so Warby Parker has a huge potential customer base.  I don't know too much about the other two companies you mentioned.",gvesyno,t3_mvoezv
4035,1619054648.0,,,,,"Impossible is hot garbage. I've had better ""meat"" marinating firm tofu in liquid smoke. Fuck that company.

Their marketing is ridiculous though, they have granola eating NPR hosts salivating over burgers...so maybe calls anyway.",gve7zpq,t3_mvoezv

4038,1619056456.0,,,,,Warby Parker is America’s Best eyewear but stylish. It’s a great business. I’ve been a customer several times now.,gvebkhf,t3_mvoezv
4039,1619074208.0,,,,,I’ll wait a few days but I’m definitely getting in on impossible and Oatly.,gvf2ld2,t3_mvoezv
4040,1619090704.0,,,,,You'll have to wait awhile.  They have good potential for ten years from now.  Sns all is hype at begin. These days.,gvfkjgg,t3_mvoezv
4041,1619092362.0,,,,,Coinbase or roblox. Open and goes up. If you can get in fast enough or drops and stays low. I don't like getting in until becomes stable enough to predict. Like the two mentioned. One is up 12% from opening. The other down 20%.,gvfmw4z,t3_mvoezv
4042,1619104336.0,,,,,"Definitely high hopes for Impossible. With more people opting for vegetarian diets, or at least in reducing meat consumption, I'm pretty confident imitation meat options are going to boom in the next few years. We're only at the cusp of that innovation. It \*might\* eventually  overtake meat eating...

Just my two cents.",gvgai9x,t3_mvoezv
4043,1619108011.0,,,,,I’d be very interested in investing with Impossible. Is there a date that it will be available to investors?,gvgj9h8,t3_mvoezv
4044,1619119996.0,,,,,"These are interesting ideas,  I will, however,  need more time to digest them.",gvhbwvh,t3_mvoezv
4045,1619227177.0,,,,,Oatly is my jam. It’s hard to find these days though. Not sure if it’s because it’s becoming increasingly popular or logistics issues. By far the best oat creamer out there in my opinion. Not sure about the numbers though. Ipo date?,gvmud9d,t3_mvoezv
4046,1619046256.0,,,,,"I’m a bit concerned about impossible being a Bill gates company.  His equity group didn’t bring QS public till it was clear that it doesn’t have any tech.  If there was good money to be made, knucklehead would just be keeping it.  I don’t know why they would be Dumping it to us on retail trade. But I’m not sure putting money up to find out.  Just research qs to see what I’m talking about.",gvdr65t,t3_mvoezv
4047,1619098057.0,,,,,I agree. Impossible is the closest thing I've ever had that tastes like meat and I'll sometimes even choose it over a regular burger. Get extra cheese (helps with texture) and you could easily forget that it's not real beef.  I'll eat it when I don't feel like feeling bloated with red meat.,gvfwp4z,t1_gvdhsi7
4048,1619050055.0,,,,,"As a Warby consumer, they’re great. Best eyeglasses purchasing experience I’ve had, they’re charitable, and the styles are actually great. 10/10 recommend as a consumer. 

As an investor, just don’t know enough about the financials. They’re affordable and a great experience IMO.",gvdyuy9,t1_gvdf4wl
4049,1619044965.0,,,,,"Coinbase was a direct listing, not an IPO. Shares already existed, and were already trading privately between $250 and $400 a share, which explains the volitility a bit on opening day.",gvdoitu,t1_gvdf8mi

4057,1619041418.0,,,,,I’ve wanted to invest in Impossible since I tried the burger in 2016. I can’t get excited about Beyond because it’s such an inferior product.,gvdh0h1,t1_gvdfpgt
4058,1619057392.0,,,,,"I think Oatly will be a fad that last a year or two and die out.  Warby, idk. They don't have any international market penetration. Or do they?  Will wait out IF if Beyond Meat's historical moves hold true for IF, also.",gvedci8,t1_gvdfpgt
4059,1619041038.0,,,,,Idk how much you’ve tried them but oatley definitely has something unique in the dairy free market. It’s proprietary oat milk is a completely different product than any other oat milk I’ve tried. It’s much higher in fat and creates creamier products.,gvdg6e2,t1_gvdd76b
4060,1619086922.0,,,,,"Not sure about the uptake of Oat milk in America but speaking for NZ/Aus, it's got massively popular.

You still have 1 slice.  The value jumps up to $2 so if you sold it, you will make profit.  You don’t own a full pie though.  Then you rush and go buy a bunch of pie slices at $2 since you just had big gains and hope it keeps growing.  

Unfortunately however, people decide they don’t want to spend $2 on a slice of pie so the value drop back down to $1 and you own a bunch of pie slices but have lost a bunch of money.

Selling a put limits your upside so your max profit will be the selling price I.e. 0.26$
And your max loss will be -(8-0)+0.26 = -7.74$

You can calculate your net payoff on expiration date as -(8-X)+.26 where X is price at expiration

You have 2 options -
1. Play it out till the expiration date
2. buying cover (netting off) your put option now (given the numbers above you’ll make a loss of .38-.26 =-0.12

1. Wait the day before or on the day your option expires, if still losing money, Roll your option to the later week or weeks, so you hope the stock price will go back up above your strike price. To roll option, Simply click Roll Option button on your trading platform. I made a mistake before by not knowing that function, simply clicked buy back, but never sell again which costed me tons of money. 

2. Close your option once the stock price bounce back and above your cost. or based on your own judgement of the stock direction, set your profit target, either keep part of premium to close the put by buying back, or wait until the option expire worthless and keep full premium you collected. The only risk is you never know if the stock goes to the direction you wanted or not.

Take the SPY chart (or S&P 500 or any other major index).  Put it on a 5 year graph.  If you squint your eyes you'll notice that you can pretty much draw a fairly straight line from 5 years ago to today and that the actual value of SPY is fairly close to it.  You could do a graph with a longer time frame, but then you'd have to take in account compound growth, inflation, other crashes, and various other factors.

So what has happened in the last 3 months?  We have caught up to around where the market would have been if the crash had not happened.  We are even slightly above where the market ""should have been"" if you strictly follow the straight line idea.

My theory is that stock prices have been recovering so quickly that the stock prices have gone above the actual value of the stocks.  I fully expect the market to be stagnant or go down slightly within the next few months until we catch back up.  The market doesn't normally grow at 75-100% in a year.

I'm not someone who looks at charts, but I'm a W.B. walking into a shop and asking which food is the most popular and its brand. Having received the answer, I buy those shares and wait for them to go up. But there is a value that cannot be found neither on charts, nor on financial statements, nor in shops: human value and potential.

I am not referring to the CEO or the CFO but to the people who make the company at the lower levels. I am referring to their behaviors, their attachment to work and the brand. What company is it that its employees are afraid of saying they are wrong if they are then fired. Better silence and go as it goes. There is a story that I invite you to read, and make yours for the future, a true story that can make you unique Redditors: The Story of a lost USB key from a leading company and of a person who found it. I'm not telling you more because you have to find this story on the internet. Then if you can't find it, ask me where to find it and I'll see if you can let you know.

You go to the farmers market to buy some seeds from a seed farmer, pay for it, and off you go. 

You go home, plant them let them grow.

Now you got yourself some produce, you want to sell them and make some money.

You go back to the market this time as a seller, you make a transaction,sell some produce, and you pay tax on it. 

You sell/make another transaction, pay tax on that, so on and on. 

If you don’t sell some produces and keep them, no tax needs to be paid as they are yours and they could continue to grow/or store. (terrible analogy now).

Edit- 
keep in mind, 1 year or less of holding any GAINS and sell = higher tax, 1 year or more of holding any GAINS before selling = less tax.

4679,1618867107.0,,,,,"Wash sales aside, the taxman doesn’t really care how many or the exact nature of the trades it took you to make a profit.

Think about it this way:

Let’s say you started the year with $50K.  You bought some asset and then sold it at $60K.  Sweet, you just made a $10K profit, as per your example.

You invest more money and then make another $2K.  So now you have a total of $62K cash.

The taxman says, you had $50K and now you have $62K.  That’s $12K profit.  We’ll take the tax on that, thank you very much.

Now, one exception to this rule might be if you straddle tax years.  For example, let’s suppose that you bought the initial $50K asset in March 2019, sold for $60K in April. Then you purchased $10K in December 2019 and sold for $12K in January 2020.

Depending on your individual tax situation, it’s possible that the $10K profit would be counted in the 2019 tax year and the additional $2K would be counted in 2020.  That’s to say, you’d still taxed on the full amount ($12K) but depending on the timing of your trades, it could be divided across two years.",gv4nrqy,t3_mu1834

Longterm capital gains (held for at least 1 year) have their own tax brackets (which are set by your income level). Short term capital gains are usually taxed as an addition to your normal income. That being said, when you are only taxed in the gains you make, so in your example the 10k you make initially and then the subsequent 2k would be the tax base. Assuming you have already paid taxes on or are tax exempt from the money you used to invest initially the IRS will never tax you on income you’ve already paid your taxes on (theres a few exceptions). Another thing, if you take a loss on an asset you held for three months, that will lower the short-term capital gains tax base that you have.

You have another stock that you bought for $100 but it is now $50 but it is a good stock and you don’t want to sell it but you want to take the loss.  (You take losses because you can offset gains with losses.)  You sell it for $50 and pick it back up for $50 the same day (or within 31 days) thinking you can apply the loss against the gain and report $0 gain to the IRS and owe no taxes.  That is not the case.   The sale and repurchase of the stock within 31 days is considered a “wash sale” and that loss is not reportable as a loss to the IRS.  You still owe taxes on the $50.  Now you have lowered your cost basis of the $100 stock that you sold for $50 but not to worry because that loss is added to your cost basis and it still looks like you paid $100 for capital gain purposes.,gv4tppd,t1_gv3xedw

I can confirm this.

>if I buy and sell the same stock all year but sell 31 days before the end of the year then any losses would be accounted for corrrct?

Not exactly true, but pretty close. All you have to do is sell the replacement shares incurred from the wash transaction before the end of the year, i.e. December 31. The easiest way to do this is to just close out your entire position that you have wash sales in.

Then do not buy back for 30 days after the fact. So if you sold on December 30, do not buy back until January 31. To be safe, I'd wait a few extra days.

This is why you get your tax docs in February. Your broker has to be sure you didn't buy back in during January.",gv76bvo,t1_gv5oiiv

We all know Peloton as the popular home-workout brand. Is the company purely a covid play or were they always destined for success? WallStreet seems to valuate the company as a low-margin hardware company, but should that really be the case? We’ll go through some of the ins and outs of the company’s metrics, potential risks, catalysts, and a look at the company’s growth as the world re-opens from lockdowns.

**Covid play or is this the new trend?**

It could be debated that Peloton would not be where they are today without covid and the global lockdowns that occurred. However, were they truly a covid play or did the virus simply speed up the process of them becoming a home-workout powerhouse? The world is re-opening, but demand for their bikes are still at peak. The CEO noted in their latest earnings call (Feb-04-2021) that even with the vaccine roll-out demand for the bike has not decreased.

“We still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. We haven't seen any softening of demand.”

A look at Google search trends for the term “Peloton” as well as their traffic estimation from high-end SEO tools would also suggest that demand has remained consistent.

&#x200B;

Peloton has been accurate with their next-quarter guidance and they’ve been beating estimates consistently, but they seem to slightly sand-bag full-year guidance creating “easy beats”. Let’s go through a few factors that make Peloton the strong company that they are, and a deep dive into some of the growth they can expect post-covid.

**Brand Loyalty** 

Peloton has succeeded in becoming the go-to name for in-home cycling classes, and as they expand, the in-home workout leader. Their brand-loyalty also rivals some of the best of the best. When looking at the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is a ranking of brand loyalty, Peloton has a score in the high 90’s which is a greater score than BOTH Apple and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/yyuwhwehvxt61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd6838be56deb1e3f136871b78d6b2b8e0a8edb

This is attributed to the high-quality content the company pushes to end-users through their pre-recorded and live classes. Users always have plenty of options when it comes to taking classes with their favorite instructors. Their NPS score is even more evident with the churn-rate Peloton experiences on memberships. Is the churn-rate really that important? In this industry, yes, and in my opinion this is what will differentiate Peloton as more of a tech valuation instead of “just” a hardware company.

To give you reference of how good Peloton’s churn rate is, let’s compare it to Apple TV+ and Netflix. First, the “churn” is the rate of attrition the company experiences over a time-period. Basically it means how often they are **losing** customers. AppleTV+ has a [20% churn rate](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/), which is quite high, while Netflix has a [churn rate of 3%](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/). So what was Peloton’s churn rate last quarter? 0.76%, some of the lowest levels in *any* industry. The company has consistently had churn under 1% since the Pandemic began, and they expect churn to remain under 0.80% for the foreseeable future. You must remember that this number affects the *recurring revenue* source for the company, which is critical for them.

**Big revenue growth, almost no profits. What gives?**

While it’s true that Peloton has been having blow-out quarter after blow-out quarter, they have just barely been profitable. Last quarter (Q2-2021), they did a mere $63.6 million of net income [**on over a billion in revenue**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549). Doesn’t look great from the outside, but we have to remember that this company has been selling every single bike they’ve ever produced and can barely keep up with the high demand over the last 4 quarters. They’ve invested aggressively into the expansion of their [**supply chain infrastructure**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/) and recently they [**acquired Precor**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor), another fitness chain with strong connections to hotels and gyms, for $420 million. The Precor acquisition will substantially increase domestic manufacturing capabilities for their bike and tread product. Here’s a look at the current OTD (order-to-delivery) times within the USA, from the Peloton website.

https://preview.redd.it/kwnbtizivxt61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96981504fb19209f11e56ef8bd49795c8d5eaf0

We can see that even after exponentially increasing their production capacity over the last year customers still need to wait weeks or months to receive the product. Peloton has been working hard to get delivery times down to the desired 1-2 weeks. Management noted that with these aggressive supply chain investments they will be able to get there by Q3 or Q4, 2021. Management commented on OTD times in their last earnings call.

“the successes that we're seeing in getting the order to delivery down and getting our backlog down are 100% based on incredible upgrades, and our manufacturing capacity up to over six times -- 6x increase in just the last 12 months in our capacity of them know -- we're now making more Bikes on a monthly basis than we did in all of fiscal 2018”

Due to covid there’s been a lot of delays (unloading times 4x longer than a year ago) at the west coast port-of-entry that has forced Peloton to re-schedule many deliveries. Another reason why net profits have been affected to such an extant is that Peloton has already started what they expect to be over 100 million expenditure in expediting shipments using more expensive methods (air freight). From the CC:

“Though we're beginning to see the benefits of our extensive supply chain investments, our delivery wait times remain elevated… we are investing over $100 million in expedited shipping to reduce the wait times for our products.

But what I can say is that we do expect that this $100 million, which we recognize is a very large investment. We believe will get us back to normal shipping protocol by the end of this fiscal year… the expedited shipping investment brings down OTD. And that gets inventory into warehouses, which is going to allow us to get aggressive with marketing really for the first time”

**Risks to the downside**

I’m seeing a few notable risks that might have a negative effect on the company. I’ll go through them here:

**Cheaper Competition:** we have a less “premium” brand also entering the scene with NordicTrack now providing similar products at a much lower cost.

**Long delivery times:** It’s only natural that when you go to the checkout page for your brand new Peloton bike and see a delivery time of nearly 2-3 months you might be turned away to a competitor (such as the NordicTrack, ProForm, or SoulCycle bike). However, like we mentioned earlier is that Peloton has extremely high brand loyalty. People want a Peloton, just like they prefer Apple iPhone over Samsung (or vice versa), or Lululemon clothing instead of the off-brand (and much cheaper) at Walmart.

**Re-opening risks:** As the world re-opens the risk of churn becomes higher as well. However, it is my opinion that gym-goers will maintain both their gym membership as well as their Peloton membership. This is not a “one or the other” case. I would not be surprised if Peloton subscriber churn rate stayed under 1% as everything re-opens. A risk to the company none-the-less.

**Low-margin equipment sales:** Back in August 2020, Peloton CEO noted that each bike is sold at nearly break-even, meaning they don’t make any money on the sale. The true net-profit will be locking the user into the Peloton content ecosystem. He also stated that due to the economies of scale they are creating that eventually (and most likely already), they will be making a profit on each bike sold. He also mentions on the Q1 2021 earnings call that both the original Bike and the Bike+ have extremely similar margins. Peloton doesn’t disclose the specific mix of their products that attribute to revenues and how many treads were sold vs bikes vs Bike+, but I think it’s safe to assume that each of their products will have similar margins.

**Freight Pricing Pressure:** This has been quite a challenge for the company. They’ve been maneuvering through logistics issues and have dedicated $100 million to reducing the OTD times to keep new customers happy. Due to covid, this freight pricing pressure might continue for the rest of the year and possibly longer. Management has noted that their forward guidance does already include these inefficiencies, which is obvious because the company’s growth in 2020 would have been much stronger had it been able to fulfill every single order it had on the books.

**Over-investment into supply chain:** There are also some risks associated with all these supply chain investments the company is making. Right now it seems like a smart play to keep up with the demand of bikes and treads, but at what cost? 420 million Precor acquisition, an extra 100 million investment in expediting shipments, further investments into their Taiwan manufacturing site are all cutting deeply into margins. There is risk that 2-3 years from now they have more supply than demand and the question of the validity of these supply-chain investments may come up. However, in my opinion, Peloton management has been doing a great job at managing the difficulties not only with logistics through covid, but also with the explosive growth the company has seen.

**Potential Catalysts**

**International Expansion**

Until now Peloton has been laser-focused on the U.S market. They’ve been slowly [expanding into Europe and Canada](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-expands-to-europe-and-canada-300644577.html), and have just recently opened up the tread market in United Kingdom. From their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had some positive comments to say about European markets:

“U.K. Tread sales have exceeded our expectations, and our early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.”

The demand for Peloton is highest in the United States at the moment, but that doesn’t go to say the product can’t succeed internationally. In my opinion, *when* demand in the U.S starts to decrease it will be off-set by the increase of growth in international markets.

**More on the Precor Acquisition**

Going back a bit more on the Precor acquisition. This was a strategic move by management and will have a two-fold positive effect on the company. The first is that delivery times will finally be shortened with the wide manufacturing footprint that will be created in the U.S. This will also alleviate stress of high shipping costs that the company has incurred. The Precor deal and having a U.S based factory should lead to better performance for Peloton’s bottom line. Second, Precor has very good relationships with channels that Peloton has not yet penetrated. This will help Peloton gain instant-access to some very lucrative end-markets, which include schools, clubs, hotels, and gyms. When asked about the Precor acquisition on their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had to say:

“it's been enormous curiosity about what this could mean in terms of delivering a combined Precor Peloton experience in the commercial channel”

They want to get Peloton into all these channels and the possibilities are endless.

**Economies of Scale**

It’s evident the company has been bogged down by extensive costs and “growing pains”. They’ve maneuvered through the Pandemic and are meeting extremely high demand by spending a lot more on shipping and getting product from their factory in Taiwan to the warehouse in the United States. They also have large expenditures on creating content, hiring instructors, and maintaining the quality of product. All this to keep users engaged. With the Precor acquisition, these expenses will become a lower percent of the revenue generated as margins are increased and revenue increases.

**Valuation**

There are quite a few topics I want to touch base on in terms of the company’s valuation. I think if we were to use a benchmark of value, we could look at Nautilus Inc (NLS), which is a fitness equipment manufacturing company, is currently trading at 1x trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenues… On the other side of things, you have tech stocks trading at incredibly high valuations all because they are bringing in high-margin recurring revenue. So the debate will be low-margin hardware versus high-margin recurring revenue. Peloton fits somewhere in the middle.

WallStreet’s main concerns for Peloton are going to be over the company’s margins, and the longevity of the increased “covid” demand. The big question is, what happens when demand slows? After-all, the market is a forward-looking. I want to look at this in two ways. The first is going to be international expansion off-setting a slow in growth in the United States. The second is going to be a look at the recurring revenues and continued subscriber growth over the next 2-3 years.

**Demand**

As with any product, the demand for Peloton products will eventually plateau. Peloton has done well by releasing the new treadmill product, with rumors of a rowing machine and other in-home fitness equipment. I would not be surprised to see Peloton develop a very robust product line. However, as growth slows in one segment (bikes) a new segment will open up (tread/rower/other products). With 2 million in cash on the balance sheet Peloton is in a great position to expand their brand into other segments both in the domestic USA and internationally.

Peloton’s expansion internationally is still in the very early stages as they’ve only just began to penetrate these markets. Like I touched up on previously, the increased demand internationally will off-set some of the growth slowing in the United States. The end-goal of the company is to increase margins on their hardware products, while selling a lot of it, and then locking users into their ecosystem with the recurring subscription which will be a big money-maker for them.

**Subscriptions**

The subscription revenues, which currently have a 60% gross profit, are going un-noticed with the company’s valuation. In their most recent quarter (Q2-2021) they did over 1.064 billion in revenue. From that revenue, approximately 81.7% came from sales of bikes, treads, and other products in their “connected fitness” segment. The other 18.3% came from subscription revenue. Their “connected fitness” and “subscription revenue” segments also come in with gross profits of 35.3%, and 60.3%, respectively.

Their guidance for Q3-2021 had similar performance to last quarter, where they guided another billion in revenue and an additional 300m subscribers to their network. This is also coming off their holiday season quarter, which generally provides an additional boost in sales. In my opinion, I think it would be safe to assume that continued high demand in the U.S market, with growing international exposure will get the company doing $2 billion in revenue per quarter. Remember that 18.3% of that revenue is recurring from their subscription model. This would generate about $366 million in subscription revenue per quarter, and on a twelve-month basis approximately $1.47 billion per year. Here’s a look at their Q2-2021 revenue and subscriber growth.

https://preview.redd.it/no1s4xkkvxt61.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d9030c404791abd6563d9ef13c605fd7a20279

Peloton currently has a market cap of $32 billion. *If* the company were to achieve $2 billion revenues per quarter in 1-2 years, which in my opinion is quite probable, then at current valuations they would be trading at 4x sales, with 20% of that coming from recurring subscriptions. Don’t forget they have a strong balance sheet with just over 2 million in cash assets for future investments.

I like the stock and would like to invest in it while it is trading at a market cap below 10-15x revenues. At that same valuation today they would be priced at $180 instead of $110.

**TLDR;**

1. The company has had blowout quarter after blowout quarter, but barely turning a profit. They have been experiencing “growing pains” and invested heavily into their supply chain infrastructure. $420 million Precor acquisition, $100 million in *additional* expedited shipping costs, and digital content production have cut heavily into their margins.
2. They are doing $1 billion revenues per quarter and with steady growth they might get up to $2 billion per quarter in 2022. Approximately 20% of that revenue will be *recurring* revenue from their fitness subscription model. Not only that, but they are also adding 300m new subscribers to their ecosystem each quarter. 
3. With all these supply chain infrastructure upgrades they are still selling every single bike they can produce. Management noted that demand has remained high even with global vaccine roll-outs. They are just getting their feet wet with international markets, which could provide another boost in demand.
4. There are a few concerns about the company moving forward, such as: low margin product, over-investment in new factories and acquisitions, long delivery times turning customers to competitors, and re-opening risks. We’ve addressed these above.
5. If the company can prove they are more than a “hardware” manufacturing company WallStreet will give them the proper valuation. They are currently on track to have over 2m paying members to their integrated fitness model and I would not be surprised if they hit over 3-4 million members by 2022.",Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD),11.0,,,

4800,1618716668.0,,,,,"Most individual investors cannot beat the SPY over the long term.  Plenty of articles that you can refer to that confirm that.  However, it is fun to play with some of the money.  You have a lot of time, so you can be aggressive, but if you are concerned with losses, then I would recommend safer investments.  Do research, invest slowly, don't expect huge gains in the short term and you will be fine.

I have invested in some stocks that were +300%+ and others that I lost 90%.  Keep track of your winners and losers and learn.  You do have plenty of time, but just keep risk in mind.",guxlr3h,t3_mt3o9c
4801,1618743045.0,,,,,"Put 10% of what you were gonna put in ETFs into LEAPS on those same ETFs. Look at the 10 year average return and figure out a reasonable 2 year target and buy the longest call at that strike point. I would highly suggest QQQ $500 Dec 2023. Once these calls are ITM you can sell some of them and repeat the process, extending your exposure and time to hedge against short term dips. You’ll turbo charge your returns on relatively safe ETFs, worst case scenario is you’re down 10%, best case scenario is you never have to work again.",guygjhe,t3_mt3o9c

4803,1618716274.0,,,,,"You're in great shape, just keep investing consistently in stuff that's not meme stocks and you can't go wrong.

I am older but in a similar financial situation, my general strategy is to split my investing budget in half, invest half in individual ETFs that I enjoy owning and following, and then toss the other half into a robo account on Schwab that automatically rebalances and tax loss harvests to make it through downturns. I also have a smaller IRA on which I run the wheel just to keep things interesting and tax-free.

I wouldn't keep any set percentage of investing income in cash unless you are betting on an imminent downturn, but definitely would keep an emergency fund of 6 months expenses set aside in a savings account.

Best of luck, and congrats on the awesome situation!",guxl4y2,t3_mt3o9c

Keep 20% of your money as dry powder to use in dips, correction or crash to get good companies on rock bottom prices. Have VOO 45%, VXF 15%, VEA 16%, VWO 8%, ACUV 10%, & AVDV 6%.

4815,1618753812.0,,,,,Mm. I’ve had good returns with only slightly increased risks holding LEAPS call options on the SPY. I’d research that. It’s like holding shares of the SPY but with better returns and only slightly higher risk.,guyv8mb,t3_mt3o9c

4830,1618698254.0,mt0ia5,"That’s basically it.

The only downside I could see is if I buy something like VOOG (S&P High Growth) and let it sit for a couple decades and then want to switch it over to a normal growth fund, I’d have to sell it first, pay the taxes, then reinvest it. The upside of course is that I don’t need to pay brokerage or management fees with Robinhood. I’m assuming if I used something like Fidelity, I’d be able to more easily shift my risk tolerance later in life.....

Robinhood’s no-fees look really attractive but are there any downsides?",Is there a downside to buying index funds on Robinhood?,1.0,,,
4831,1618719029.0,,,,,You could always do a brokerage transfer and pay no fees on it because you wouldn’t be selling. And I’m not sure if there is any downside I did use Robinhood but mainly for options before I moved to TD. You could ask support but knowing RH you’re gonna be waiting a while. On a side note fidelity offers zero Commission funds that might be worth looking into for you. Personally I have some in my IRA,guxpe1e,t3_mt0ia5
4832,1618723607.0,,,,,"A lot of brokers offer zero fees when trading securities like an ETF.  SEC and FINRA fees still apply.  Vanguard does not charges fees to buy an ETF or stock.

4833,1618719594.0,,,,,"The downside to buying anything on Robinhood is that you may not get the best execution.  The reason, of course, is that the way they make money by selling order flow.  

Other companies have mutual funds you can buy that change the portfolio over time based on how your risk tolerance should change over time.  How is it done?  By changing the ratio of bonds to stocks.  I doubt that you’d find one 100% invested in just growth stocks. 

If you are truly concerned with taxes and you are investing for retirement, then perhaps a tax-advantaged retirement account would be a better choice.  In such an account, selling wouldn’t trigger taxes.",guxq8j8,t3_mt0ia5
4834,1618844078.0,,,,,"There is not really a downside to using RH to buy an index fund. Use a limit order instead of a market order though. 

Robinhood doesn't really charge you a fee but most brokers don't charge fees anymore. 

I suggest opening accounts with multiple brokers and checking them out. I use RH TD and fidelity and RH and TD are my go to. The other brokers offer more tools and give more information that you have to pay for on RH.
