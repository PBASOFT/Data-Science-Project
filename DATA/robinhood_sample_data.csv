70,1620568024.0,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is‚Ä¶ Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird‚Äôs eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people‚Äôs money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here‚Äôs a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having ‚Äúfun‚Äù. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",162.0,,,

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough. 

Thanks",Capital gains tax period with mergers,88.0,,,
169,1620416868.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I doubt you need to see an accountant.  Most stock for stock mergers in the US are tax-free (which means the holding period doesn't restart) to shareholders, but there are requirements that must be met for tax-free treatment.  There are three ways to figure out whether the acquisition qualified (assuming you are in the US, and the companies are in the US):

\- Easiest - find the press release for the merger, which should say whether the merger will be tax-free for investors).  If it doesn't say, don't assume it will be taxable, but use one of the other ways.

\- Find the tax disclosure in the merger proxy.  Look up the old company on the SEC's website using EDGAR.  Find the DEFM14A, which is the merger proxy.  Search for ""tax"".  There will be a few pages on tax consequences, but best to find the FAQs (usually called ""Question and Answers"") or the comment in the Summary re taxes

\- Send a message to RH and they should be able to tell you when your holding period started

Note, any cash received would most likely be taxable. 

An example of a merger proxy is here:

170,1620415098.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You should be able to just look at your capital gains/losses to-date.  They (the broker) have to specify for tax purposes whether the capital gain or loss of any transaction is short term or long term.   I'm no longer on Robinhood so I'm not sure if you can just look that up or if you have to request your paperwork with them.  If you see that your shares are not showing as long-term, that's Robinhood's problem, as they are required to give you accurate data for tax purposes.  Bring it up with them if there's a problem.  I know I can look at all of my gains/losses broken into short and long term at any time with my current broker.   A merger or other ticker change does not change your date of purchase or cost basis.  Note:  I have not experienced this first-hand, so of course consult a tax professional if your gains still show as short term (assuming you even sold them and the issue comes up).",gxb3aux,t3_n75o8q
171,1620414456.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Assume you're in the US? I think what you're saying is you're trying to avoid SHORT TERM cap gains right?

172,1620417755.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You're good.

No capital gains, until you sell the new stock. I've had this happen to me several times before. 

The catch is if it is a cash to shareholders or partial cash to shareholds in the transaction, you will have to pay capital gains on the cash. If it is less then a year short-term gains rules apply.

This isn't uncommon as the buying company only gives even unsplit shares out and the pricing dictated some people ended up with 5.33 shares. The company might give you 5 shares of the new stock and the value of 0.33 shares in cash. You would then have capitol gains on that cash.

&#x200B;

The safest way to check is post-merge check your brokerage account. There will be a section that is called something along the line of ""Realized Gain/Loss"" and you can see your list of gains and losses taken for the year as they occur. You might need to be on the website version of your brokerage account access.

I can see where I had a cash gain due to these partial shares being paid in cash right now in my account in 2020.

In 2020, I had another stock sold to another company that was an all-cash offer, and I had to take capital gains on the year that buy-out of the company happened. 

It will also show you if you had a holding go completely bankrupt and was completely devalued. You can't control when you take that loss, unless you sell it in advance.

&#x200B;

Another scenario, it can also show you. Slightly more complex. I owned Yahoo a few years ago. They old off assets from their primary company, but they also owned stocks in other companies. The biggest was Alibaba. When Yahoo went out of business the stock turned into a holding company with no long-term intention to be an investment company. Over time they sold off their assets and gave shareholders cash directly. I can't control when they distribute that cash, but I pay capitol gains on that in the year they pay me. Oddly enough, these things can take years sometimes and it can become hard to sell off these companies when they are no longer listed in a stock exchange and they become smaller. I usually try to get out of these companies before they get to that point.",gxb90fl,t3_n75o8q

From what i‚Äôve learned it seems that diversification works well for someone looking to grow their money over a long period of time. Because of that I put my money into 8 different etf‚Äôs a couple weeks ago. Last week, i dove a little deeper into crypto and found ethereum. Seems like a pretty safe bet long term to either break even or sky like bitcoin, so i added some to my portfolio. Recently I read that it‚Äôs basically pointless to have so many etfs because of inevitable overlapping, so i‚Äôm down to 5 etf‚Äôs and eth.

So I setup a Robinhood account last night and I linked it to my bank and put money into my Robinhood account. I got a free stock and I put some money into dogecoin. So my questions are

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.

202,1620308797.0,,RobinHood,,,,"If you are on a (free) cash account, it is impossible that you will owe money, as you will only be able to use what you deposit (buying power), you can only buy what you have the available buying power for and whatever you buy can only go to $0, not negative.

If you are on an (free) instant account, when you start a transfer to Roninhood, they make the $ amount instantly available to you for trading, even though it hasn't been withdrawn from your bank yet. So the only way you can owe money is if you start a transfer but it gets returned insufficient funds from your bank, and they will reverse the transfer.

On both free accounts, interest isn't paid, its earned. I have a 0.3% interest rate (be aware that is zero point three percent, as in less than 1 percent, not 30 percent), and you will accrue interest monthly on any cash in your Robinhood portfolio. 

Only when you start borrowing money from them can you end up owing money, and even then, unless you literally are spending money you KNOW you don't have, it will be difficult to go in the negative.",gx5e3iq,t3_n677o1

You should see something called Margin Investing - check and ensure that it‚Äôs disabled. If you enable Margin Investing, you‚Äôre essentially trading on borrowed funds, where you‚Äôll owe 2.5% flat interest rate on anything above $1000. 

You could end up owing money in two ways:

1. If you have margin enabled, where you trade on borrowed money and you don‚Äôt profit and end up owing RH money. If this happens, you‚Äôll get a ‚Äúmargin call‚Äù to make up for the funds. 
2. If you play with some sophisticated options like credit spreads, which may not go your way.

Vice versa, If your investment doubles in worth (now it worth 200 dollars) the ten dollars you invested would be worth double. To sum it up, if your investing your own money;

A. You will never owe money from your loses - should you decide to sell your investment back at a lower price.

B. If you sell your stock, or crypto at a higher price in which you get a profit, you will owe taxes on what you earned as a ""short term capitol gain"". (Example, your investment from 10 dollars went to 20, and you sold. You will owe taxes on the 10 dollars earned)

It goes down when lots of people sell it, but people have to own the stock before they can sell it, so you can typically keep an eye on stuff like that based on the numbers, rumors, etc. You can get a somewhat decent idea of the risk level of a selloff when buying a call. However, a stock goes up when people are buying, and you have no way of knowing when someone out there is about to make a massive purchase that is going to drive the price up, or when the company is going to make an announcement that will cause a buying frenzy, etc. all of which can come out of nowhere and completely screws you over if you have a put. (yes, there are some negative announcements that can come out to make a price drop suddenly, but those seem to be more rare than good announcements that cause big climbs).",gxb0q95,t1_gx7gf17

I buy it again the next day at $900. It goes to $1000 and I sell. Profit $100.

This means I pay taxes on the $100 gain but don‚Äôt offset anything with the $100 loss? Even though I am net $0?

EDIT: in other words, to avoid this issue, if I sell at a loss I MUST not buy the same stock for at least 30 days?

Also what about the reverse situation...
Buy at $900, sell at $1000. 
Next day buy at $1000 sell at $900.

You still have to claim the gain but cannot claim the loss.  The order of the transactions doesn't matter. The rule is that if you purchase the same stock within 30 days (before or after) of selling it, you cannot realize the loss. It's factored into the stock's cost basis instead.",gx8mqt4,t1_gx6itsa

423,1620568024.0,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is‚Ä¶ Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird‚Äôs eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people‚Äôs money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here‚Äôs a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having ‚Äúfun‚Äù. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",159.0,,,

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago?

\- Easiest - find the press release for the merger, which should say whether the merger will be tax-free for investors).  If it doesn't say, don't assume it will be taxable, but use one of the other ways.

\- Find the tax disclosure in the merger proxy.  Look up the old company on the SEC's website using EDGAR.  Find the DEFM14A, which is the merger proxy.  Search for ""tax"".  There will be a few pages on tax consequences, but best to find the FAQs (usually called ""Question and Answers"") or the comment in the Summary re taxes

\- Send a message to RH and they should be able to tell you when your holding period started

Note, any cash received would most likely be taxable. 

An example of a merger proxy is here:

523,1620415098.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You should be able to just look at your capital gains/losses to-date.  They (the broker) have to specify for tax purposes whether the capital gain or loss of any transaction is short term or long term.   I'm no longer on Robinhood so I'm not sure if you can just look that up or if you have to request your paperwork with them.  If you see that your shares are not showing as long-term, that's Robinhood's problem, as they are required to give you accurate data for tax purposes.  Bring it up with them if there's a problem.  I know I can look at all of my gains/losses broken into short and long term at any time with my current broker.   A merger or other ticker change does not change your date of purchase or cost basis.  Note:  I have not experienced this first-hand, so of course consult a tax professional if your gains still show as short term (assuming you even sold them and the issue comes up).",gxb3aux,t3_n75o8q
524,1620414456.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Assume you're in the US? I think what you're saying is you're trying to avoid SHORT TERM cap gains right? My impression is that a merger shouldn't affect that - your cost basis and holding period should remain. I'd get advice on this from a tax professional however first.

525,1620417755.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You're good.

No capital gains, until you sell the new stock. I've had this happen to me several times before. 

The catch is if it is a cash to shareholders or partial cash to shareholds in the transaction, you will have to pay capital gains on the cash. If it is less then a year short-term gains rules apply.

This isn't uncommon as the buying company only gives even unsplit shares out and the pricing dictated some people ended up with 5.33 shares. The company might give you 5 shares of the new stock and the value of 0.33 shares in cash. You would then have capitol gains on that cash.

&#x200B;

The safest way to check is post-merge check your brokerage account. There will be a section that is called something along the line of ""Realized Gain/Loss"" and you can see your list of gains and losses taken for the year as they occur. You might need to be on the website version of your brokerage account access.

I can see where I had a cash gain due to these partial shares being paid in cash right now in my account in 2020.

In 2020, I had another stock sold to another company that was an all-cash offer, and I had to take capital gains on the year that buy-out of the company happened. 

It will also show you if you had a holding go completely bankrupt and was completely devalued. You can't control when you take that loss, unless you sell it in advance.

&#x200B;

Another scenario, it can also show you. Slightly more complex. I owned Yahoo a few years ago. They old off assets from their primary company, but they also owned stocks in other companies. The biggest was Alibaba. When Yahoo went out of business the stock turned into a holding company with no long-term intention to be an investment company. Over time they sold off their assets and gave shareholders cash directly. I can't control when they distribute that cash, but I pay capitol gains on that in the year they pay me. Oddly enough, these things can take years sometimes and it can become hard to sell off these companies when they are no longer listed in a stock exchange and they become smaller. I usually try to get out of these companies before they get to that point.",gxb90fl,t3_n75o8q

538,1620416370.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Hey everyone, new investor with <500 put into my RH acc so far. I have a question about ETF‚Äôs & Crypto. From what i‚Äôve learned it seems that diversification works well for someone looking to grow their money over a long period of time. Because of that I put my money into 8 different etf‚Äôs a couple weeks ago. Last week, i dove a little deeper into crypto and found ethereum. Seems like a pretty safe bet long term to either break even or sky like bitcoin, so i added some to my portfolio. Recently I read that it‚Äôs basically pointless to have so many etfs because of inevitable overlapping, so i‚Äôm down to 5 etf‚Äôs and eth. My splits are: VTI-20%, VOO-20%, VTG-20%, ETH-20%, MSOS-10%, VONG-10%. Is this a decent plan? 


TLDR: Portfolio is VTI-20%, VOO-20%, VTG-20%, ETH-20%, MSOS-10%, VONG-10%. About to add funds, Will it work long term?",gxb61qd,t3_n6uyqq

If you are on an (free) instant account, when you start a transfer to Roninhood, they make the $ amount instantly available to you for trading, even though it hasn't been withdrawn from your bank yet. So the only way you can owe money is if you start a transfer but it gets returned insufficient funds from your bank, and they will reverse the transfer.

On both free accounts, interest isn't paid, its earned. I have a 0.3% interest rate (be aware that is zero point three percent, as in less than 1 percent, not 30 percent), and you will accrue interest monthly on any cash in your Robinhood portfolio.

You rebuy AMZN at $2000 on December 16th and sell AMZN for $4,000 on December 31st ($2,000).

For the tax season of that year you owe taxes on the $2,000 that you made but cannot claim the $2,000 you lost.

If you day trade and do this many times your losses won't help you on that year of taxes but your gains will still owe taxes. So if you trade a million times and make $1 every other trade and lose $1 every other trade you need to pay taxes on $500,000 you made although in reality you have $0 in your pocket.

The company itself is trying to do things that make the price go higher, sometimes the government is taking action to try to keep the overall stock market going up, etc. Overall the odds are already against you to start with.

Plus, just think about the price of the stock itself. It goes down when lots of people sell it, but people have to own the stock before they can sell it, so you can typically keep an eye on stuff like that based on the numbers, rumors, etc. You can get a somewhat decent idea of the risk level of a selloff when buying a call. However, a stock goes up when people are buying, and you have no way of knowing when someone out there is about to make a massive purchase that is going to drive the price up, or when the company is going to make an announcement that will cause a buying frenzy, etc. all of which can come out of nowhere and completely screws you over if you have a put.

The way you pay it back is deposit more money or sell so that you place cash back into your account, if you are running on margin the cash will go against your margin. Keep in mind last time I checked the margin rates for robinhood they were about 2% and they gave you $1000 that doesn't accumulate interest.

So you can run $1000 into margin and not be charged any monthly interest. You will pay their $5 for robinhood gold, but it's worth it IMO.",gx2xnnh,t3_n5pl3t

You need the amount available to cover the margin you borrowed before you can turn it off.

So, let's say you have $1000 margin invested and $500 in cash. You need to sell $500 so that you have $1000 ""in cash"" before you can turn margin off.

Once it's off, you'll have $0 in cash because you paid back the margin (and $500 left invested).

Of course you *can* just use it as extra funds for a fee, and I‚Äôll admit I do that too, but there‚Äôs a view that that can be dangerous but even moreso wasteful because of the interest if you do it long term.

706,1620131632.0,,RobinHood,,,,As long as you aren‚Äôt writing any options (making you the party responsible for taking the loss from an ITM option) then the lowest you should be able to go is 0. Unless you‚Äôre using margin of course.,gwwdxri,t3_n4f7ns
707,1620129252.0,,RobinHood,,,,"If you are long options with no leverage, no. If you are short options uncovered, or if you use leverage, yes. There are some cases where your broker will liquidate your position automatically if you suffer sufficient losses on short or leveraged positions, in which case you will need to repay any shortfall in the account. 

One example:
You deposit $5,000 into your account, then purchase $8,000 of weekly in the money calls using robinhood gold. The underlying drops 20% during the holding period and the options expire worthless. Robinhood will either have liquidated the position once the value dropped sufficiently, or an hour before expiration on the expiration date. You now owe robinhood $3,000. 

If you are not intimately familiar with the mechanics of options I would strongly suggest not trading them.",gww9xaz,t3_n4f7ns
708,1620125047.0,,RobinHood,,,,If just buying calls or puts yes you can only lose premium.,gww3xmw,t3_n4f7ns
709,1620138393.0,,RobinHood,,,,"No. Apart from what it means to exercise an option, the first thing to understand is the ability to exercise a contract is available only for option buyers - not option sellers. When you buy an option you 'own' the rights within the contract. This is not true for option sellers. The selling party has sold the rights within the contract and therefore cannot exercise those rights (since they do not own them).

The second thing to understand is that when you buy options, you cannot lose more than the price of the option itself. In other words, your maximum loss is whatever you paid for the option.

Let's put these ideas together. When you use the language ""without exercising a contract"" by definition you are referring to option buyers. As a buyer, then, the lowest value of your option contracts, at expiration for example, is 0. 

Hope that helps

712,1620143682.0,,RobinHood,,,,As long as you're not trading on margin you shouldn't have a negative account. Trading on margin is when you trade with borrowed money. DO NOT DO THAT.  For options the most you can lose is what ever the price of the option was.,gwx4y14,t3_n4f7ns

728,1620062993.0,,RobinHood,,,,I think the asking price is the minimum a seller of a stock would accept.. and the Bid is the most a buyer would pay for the said stock... the Bid-Ask spread is the difference between those two numbers.. the smaller the spread is the more liquidity the stock or option has and the larger the spread the less liquidity..

If I place a sell at .39 it moves the entire spread from .39 ask and the bid moves up.

733,1620085009.0,,RobinHood,,,,"The best way to think of this is to imagine the NYSE 100
Years ago.  You have a room full of buyers and sellers all yelling over each other to either buy at the lowest possible or sell at the highest.  Within this, buyers are trying to outbid each other while sellers are trying to undercut each other, depending on their determination or necessity to sell and buy.  This is where the bid- ask spread comes from.  This is also why the more people participating in the trading of a stock, the closer the bid/ask of that underlying becomes.  Market makers are essentially doing this in real time.  This is also why, although virtually all trading is done on a computer, we still operate by the same market hours we always have.  Without the most people possible participating in the market at the same time, prices can become unclear and you very likely will get ripped off.",gwuf7g5,t3_n41ivh

738,1620102019.0,,RobinHood,,,,I think some traders use bots or automatic api connection to automatically match the lowest ask. I noticed when I went from $1.80 a contract all the way to $.30 a contract and the same 18 contracts kept following my price change instantly.

739,1620102142.0,,RobinHood,,,,Also your example to me is more that the price will always average out between the bid and ask so when the new ask is lower that the last the price will be even lower than that due to averaging out between the bid and the ask,gwvcd9l,t1_gwu2jyu

746,1620063810.0,,RobinHood,,,," Hello, I have never had a job or needed to pay taxes so I have very little idea of how to do it in general. 

I have bought and sold cryptocurrency in around $100-$150 increments, 12 total transactions counting buying and selling on robinhood and made maybe $5 at most in the past few days. I was just bored sitting on my phone buying and selling as it went up and down a few cents, I did not do enough research and just did not think about it from a tax perspective.

I know it seems petty but I am concerned about what that will do to me tax wise as I assume I will now have to file for the first time and for such a small amount earned. 

Do I only pay taxes on the $5 earned, or will I have to pay some for each of the transactions?",gwt38dk,t3_n3sdik

The right time to finish a position and take a profit is subjective. What you shouldn't do is get greedy. Greed has taken many users for their wealth on this sub. Any profit is good profit.

One other note is that you should invest to build wealth not to pay for cancer.
This is purely an example, suppose your treatment costs $1000 and you have all of your capital in one investment. You make a good trade and it increases in value to 900. You wait until it reaches $1000. But then it decreases in value to 700 and never reaches 900 again.

As for an exit strategy, that's really something you need to figure out on your own and then just commit to. It sounds like you want to take out your initial investment, are you comfortable doing that now, or are you hoping to utilize it to make more profit before taking it out? When I make an investment I commit to not needing that money again for a long time. When I take profits I never really take profits, I exit a position at a profit and then roll that into a new investment. Being in your 50s it makes sense that you might be more on the side of things where you're looking to cash out some of the profits and use them.

806,1620003608.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Depends on your risk tolerance. I‚Äôm going to assume since you have a substantial savings yet only invested $500 you are either skeptical about stocks or full of shit. I‚Äôll assume the former and we can infer low risk is what you‚Äôre looking for at this time due to small starting position. My suggestion is look into ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äù stocks. These are stocks like coca-cola, Ford, AT&T, and GE. You won‚Äôt see much growth but they have been around forever and can protect your wealth by always being around. If you aren‚Äôt so sure about managing your own stocks, valuations, or intrinsic value I‚Äôd suggest starting with mutual funds or ETF‚Äôs (exchange traded funds). Most mutual funds require a minimum purchase, can only purchase at a set time of day (regardless if it‚Äôs the best value for the stocks involved), they are managed by a person or persons, they invest in multiple stocks at once, and have fees with no guarantee of progress. ETF‚Äôs are traded on the stock market like stock, they invest in multiple stocks chosen by a person or computer algorithm, the time of purchase is the same time as market hours, they have little to no fee, some ETF‚Äôs use leverage which can be dangerous, and generally ETF‚Äôs based on indexes are the safest. ETF‚Äôs based on index‚Äôs like $SPY or $VOO or $QQQ are safe bets. This is since the market established in the late 1800‚Äôs it‚Äôs had growth. $SPY has an average growth rate of 8% since inception. If you are nearing retirement you might want to lower your risk by moving out of stock positions and into bonds. Both of these markets reflect one another. For specific stock recommendations you should speak with a financial advisor considering your experience level and available funds an advisor would help greatly. Lastly a ROTH IRA can help grow your wealth with stocks. Downsides are you can only invest $6k a year and you can‚Äôt take out until your retirement age. The pro‚Äôs will tell you put all of your $1000 into one investment because you wouldn‚Äôt choose a bad stock to invest in and diversified portfolios are for idiots. I will say I‚Äôm not a trading genius so my dumbass has a portfolio diversified over multiple sectors using individual stocks, cryptos, and ETF‚Äôs.

807,1620018924.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Remember that investing requires patience, real investing takes years, really decades, that way compound interest can work its magic. You have plenty of time as long as you don't waste 1p years trying to ""get rich quick""  It also requires cool-headedness. When people are panicking you are looking for buying opportunities, when people are riding high on a single stock, you continue to diversify.

Invest in companies you believe in for the long term, hold on for the ride and add when you beliefs are stronger than ever. Look at market Cap to determine a company's size. Individual share price does not matter, especially with fractional shares available now. Market cap = price per share √ó total # of shares.

If you plan to continue adding money to this like a retirement fund then you can buy VOO, VTI, SPY, etc, but if this $1000 is for you to  actively trade, then find some stocks you believe in and get your feet wet. $1000 isn‚Äôt going to get you far gains wise unless you mess with options, and that very well may be what you do if this is fun money and you don‚Äôt care if it disappears. Anyways, your willingness to lose this cash is a large factor in what you should do with it.",gwsquc6,t3_n3c5ze
817,1620059039.0,,RobinHood,,,,"When I pick a stock, and I‚Äôm not an expert either, I have gotten to the decision based on a tiny bit of randomness and mostly research. I joined a bunch of relevant subreddits and will watch the stocks being talked about - not to necessarily buy, but to be able to start picking. Otherwise it‚Äôs like letter soup right? Easier to have suggestions and go look them all up from there. Also I try to pay attention to things I like - a year ago AMC was struggling and experts thought they might go broke. AMC is what I‚Äôd consider the best chain in the US and I love going to the movies. Even though I‚Äôm high risk and can‚Äôt get to the movies still for a while, they‚Äôre wonderful. I put a little money in there... and over time more and sold some and did it again. I still have like 11 shares I may just never sell at this rate haha. I also love Disney and in spite of them having similar issues, dumped a bit into them too. With excellent results. Anyway my point is you can think about what you normally do or need and where YOU spend money to get inspiration for stocks to check out and possibly buy into. If you‚Äôre not into tech but recognize that it‚Äôs an area with lots of potential, do your research on ETFs or simply go for long term S&P stuff. You‚Äôre likely to trend up if you spread out your money across things that naturally tend to trend up anyway. 

Oh and, if something isn‚Äôt performing well, you will need to recognize when to cut losses and when to wait. If it‚Äôs a long term investment, hold it, but if you had a shorter term in mind and are down a small percent but want to put money into some other thing, taking a small loss for (hopefully) a decent gain is actually smart. You want your money to work for you.",gwsrwae,t3_n3c5ze

Also keep $5 free to do reverse split arbitrage. Sometimes a company will announce that 10 shares will now be consolidated into 1 share, which has the effect of increasing the price per share about 10x. (The exact ratio may differ.) So if you had 10 shares before the split, you'd now have 1 share that's worth ten times as much. That's a reverse split.

If you only had 1 share going in, you'd have 1/10 of a share after, a fraction which historically could not be traded. To get around fractional shares, companies will sometimes pay you the cash value of the fractional share. Other times, though, they will round you up to one full share. When they round up, the share you had bought for $0.50 is now worth around $5. You profit $4.50 with almost no risk.

This effects what kind of strategies you will want to employ. You also need to determine how much risk you are willing to take.

EBAY
currently $55.99
sell - 14th May - $56.00 - Put 1x100 -$1.16 - $116.00
buy -14th May - $53.00 - Put 1x100 - $0.26 - $-26.00
Total	$90.00 credit

My profit matrix looks like this (link to Options Profit Calculator):
http://opcalc.com/u6D

$90 is my maximum profit for this option trade which is fine for me.

Can I get some feedback if this is the best spread option to apply? (as opposed to a CALL CREDIT spread, iron condor or any other option programs). Are these the optimal expiration dates and strike values to maximize my profit with as little risk as possible?

Brand new Robinhood user here so please be kind!",Need feedback on Put Credit Spread,22.0,,,
860,1619982930.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Everyone has their own strategy and yours is fine. Here's how I look at it. 

With bull puts I don't think much about the stock going higher. I look for ones that I don't think will go lower. So imo Ebay is a good pick. 

Also, because I'm not looking for it to go up, I sell weeklies. Less time for it to go bad, faster time decay.

Then I focus on the break-even point I want. I look at the second lowest resistance level and see if I can find a risk/profit balance around that. With Ebay first resistance is around 55.30, second is about 54.88.

When it comes to picking strikes, I like both to be out-of-the-money with a few strikes between them. The larger spread gives you a lower profit %, but it makes the profit/loss slope longer, giving you more time to decide when to bail if it starts going bad. 

So for Ebay, I would be inclined to pick something like May 7th 55.50/51.50. With the chart I'm looking at that would be max gain 0.53, max loss 3.47. Break even at 54.97. But the profit of 15.27% is a bit low for me so I probably wouldn't do it. 

If I base it off your expected break-even of 55.10, then I would probably pick May 7 55.5/54. BE @ 55.12, 33.93% profit, max profit 0.35, max loss 1.12, probability of profit 60%. Then I'd sell 14 pairs for a credit of 490.

Again this is my current personal way of picking bull credit spreads. It's quite conservative and short-term. In this case Ebay doesn't quite fit my criteria, but it's close and maybe going out two more weeks would make it look better, but I thought it would be helpful to walk through my thought process. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how to pick your spreads with more confidence. 

Final thoughts - see what the sentiment is Monday and if it looks like it hit resistance. Also take a look at more expensive tickers so you don't have to sell as many to get a decent return amount.",gwp7424,t3_n3b99t

I think Robinhood should let you know what the fees are or what you're average cost is prior to swiping up to complete the trade. It's never accurate, nor is it consistent.

""The main difference between a [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) violation and free riding is the eventual deposit of funds to cover the buy. In free riding the buyer sells the security without ever depositing the funds to pay for the initial purchase.

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) considers a good faith violation an ""abuse of credit"" and requires the broker keep track of them.

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call. I just want to know that if I'm invested with margin that that remains true should the call continue to be volatile.",Margin maintenance and how it works with long term options,6.0,,,

1124,1619679124.0,n0ypiz,RobinHood,"I am fine creating stop loss/limit orders on stocks and one-leg options but get confused setting stop loss/limit orders on credit and debit spreads on RH. I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

A nice safe stock will get you a 10% rate of return to get you to $100K in 46 years. I'm assuming you have a much faster target time frame. That means higher return and that means much higher risk.

1164,1619638866.0,n0mz1n,RobinHood,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part‚Äî Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won‚Äôt. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I‚Äôm tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren‚Äôt required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone‚Äôs advice works and I get my money back, I‚Äôd be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that‚Äôs legal. 

tl:dr I believe Robinhood violated my rights when it sold my crypto after the order officially cancelled and restored to my account, and do not know how to proceed",Securities Sold without Permission,22.0,,,

Business owners regularly forego taking any form of compensation in the interest of the business they operate. As the holder of a non-dividend stock you are effectively that type of owner. Contingencies on holding that share are the board or whoever is tasked with handling the business finance get to make that decision for you. 

If all stocks paid divdends it would normalize share prices, PEs would converge, and prospecting/speculating would be at least inhibited if not impossible. This would likely hinder innovation and stagnate the financial markets. 

If you think there is only value in receiving a dividend, only invest in companies with a stable dividend. 

It is entirely rational, and even ethical, for the end goal of a corporation to not be dividend distribution. In fact, paying a dividend is a strategy to retain shareholders when innovation and growth have stagnated but the company is cash positive. Basically you have all this cash and nothing left to justifiably (or unjustifiably) spend it on; wages are competitive or even industry leading (or at least employee retention is good) so you distribute it to the shareholders. 

Shareholders get paid last almost always. Companies which are not cash positive but continue to pay a dividend have decided to ski a slippery slope that ends in bankruptcy.",gw7dxqe,t3_n0jx5i
1194,1619648868.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I agree with a lot of what is said here but let me go a bit more in-depth:

You start a business with some savings you have. You are going from nothing to HOPEFULLY something, but at the beginning you are (hopefully) pumping all of your money back into the company and not taking pay (because you have to innovate, advertise, scale, build inventory, etc.). 

At some point you become somewhat successful but you still aren‚Äôt taking any pay, and the company still isn‚Äôt turning a profit. You really need investors to help you scale faster and faster and hit critical mass to where you are cash flow positive. You find a VC that loves your company and they give you $$$ for, say, 20% of the company. 

So the VC works with you and you scale and become cash flow positive and now you can afford to pay yourself a small salary but the VC still doesn‚Äôt take any money out. At some point you and the VC want to go public to allow investors to buy shares and for you to cash out some from your hard work. You go public, your company trades on the market, and you are happy. 

Nothing has changed. Instead of you and the VC being the only owners, you now have millions of owners. The company is still growing however. Now that you are public ally traded your have a fiduciary duty to manage the firm to the best benefit of your shareholders. As a growth company you are growing 20% YOY, which clearly means the best use of your money is reinvesting in the company to keep growing and making your shares more valuable, thereby returning value to your shareholders. 

At some point you become SO SUCCESSFUL that you are just a cash generating MACHINE. You literally can‚Äôt find investments for the cash your company has. (Think of Apple here...which is almost exactly what happened with Apple). At the point where you and your management team can‚Äôt create a reasonable return by reinvesting the money into the company (R&D, M&A, etc) then you can return capital to shareholders and allow them to reallocate that money to other profitable investments themselves. 


That is the pretty standard startup -> growth -> value transition process. 

Hope that helps",gw87mf5,t3_n0jx5i

At expiration, the value is the difference between the stock's market price and the call's strike price.

1264,1619619612.0,n0fv4o,RobinHood,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

I would like to be to just close this out the loan personally, on my schedule.",Margin Newbie: How to pay back margin loan?,48.0,,,

My strategy for using margin is based upon dividends and future value of a stock. I started to use margin in about 2007 to gain wealth.

April, July, Oct as another stock may pay Feb. May. Aug. Nov. As another March, June, Sept. Dec...so  instead of reinvesting those dividends use the dividends to pay part of your margin.

Some of the big CryptoTwitter influencers will flex their margin skills, but they have all explained that they started with money they were willing to lose, and many of them got liquidated (100% loss to pay back the margin debt) or lost 90% or so very early on, before they got to their current positions.

1467,1619538132.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I think you get it now based on the comments. In case you don't:

Imagine you go to the store and you write a check to pay for groceries. And then you forget and buy a PS5 and then have no money in your bank account. The grocery store just got screwed over by you when the check bounces right - you just stole groceries. The grocery store may now say ""hey from now on if you write a check you have to guarantee there's enough to pay for it"". This is what's happening with Robinhood, and all brokers.

Let's use the broker now. If you have $500 with them, let's say Robinhood, and you want to buy a stock for $200 and another stock for $150. When you place the order for the first stock worth $200 let's assume no one else is selling, so there's an open order you've placed for $200 for 1 stock. When you go to place the order for the second stock, your available balance you can use will be $300 (the 500 minus the 200 for the open order). Why? Well if you say place an order for 3 of the $150 stock AND it goes through, that's like you buying the PS5. You'll have spent $450 and only have $50 left, now that first order for $200 you can't actually afford it, Robinhood doesn't want to be the grocery store (no brokers do). Now if someone else now accepts your order for the first stock worth $200 who pays for it? You certainly can't you only have $50 left. To avoid this, while you have the open order for the first stock worth $200, if you try to place another order your available balance will be $300 to make sure you can pay for the first set of groceries. So no, Robinhood didn't ""take"" your money. Your money's locked away for the order until either the order goes through or you cancel it.",gw28fuf,t3_mz5fmw

So let‚Äôs say you place your limit at .25 USD per Dogecoin... and you pay Robinhood $1,000.00 for this limit order...
If Dogecoin is currently priced at .269 USD per Dogecoin, you aren‚Äôt going to see the $1,000.00 in your buying power because you cannot use it. It is essentially queued up waiting for 1 Dogecoin to fall to .25 USD and if it does and there are available sellers, THEN your $1,000.00 is spent on the Dogecoin and you will see it reflected on your account.

You can cancel a limit order at any time before your limit set is reached... *and* it will automatically be cancelled after a certain amount of time anyway if the price never drops to your set limit.

But keep in mind, if the price **does** drop to .25 USD per Dogecoin... your money will be spent if sellers are available (and there will be most likely lol) and then your money is invested and there‚Äôs no going back. Then you are playing the Doge game! Lmfao. Until you decide to sell of course. In that case you will get back whatever returns you have on the Dogecoin, be it negative or positive... **and** this is assuming someone wants to buy your Dogecoin. So don‚Äôt set a limit price too low. Because then you‚Äôre pretty much setting up an automatic buy-in in the event of the collapse of Dogecoin LOL. Be reasonable with your limits.",gw51cxk,t3_mz5fmw

The money wasn‚Äôt available and the doge wasn‚Äôt in your account because the order you placed could NOT be filled. Meaning that even though you were willing to buy 656 at about $0.15 a coin, nobody was willing to sell at that low of a price. Therefor, the order is not filled. 

Not trying to be mean, but it REALLY sounds like you need to learn the basics of stocks/trading and what it means to buy and sell. To put it plainly, I can‚Äôt walk into a Microsoft store and buy an Xbox for $50, because they aren‚Äôt going to sell the Xbox for that low of a price. Same process behind stocks & crypto.

1570,1619463031.0,mz4w4z,RobinHood,"Hey guys! New to the subreddit, been a lurker on WSB for a long time and discovered this place from In The Money's channel :D This is my first due diligence so feel free to give me any feedback.

**-Why ETF's-**

The truth is, 89% of fund managers fail to beat the market.

According to this report, 88.99% of large-cap US funds have underperformed the S&P500 index over ten years. Knowing this, why do we as individual investors still try to beat the market as opposed to ETF investing? Overconfidence perhaps? Not sure. My main investment is SPY leaps but besides that I have one other secret ETF that has made me very rich...

**-Why investing in a water(liquid gold) ETF could make you rich!-**

I've spent hours upon hours scouring the web for an ETF that I feel could reliably beat the S&P 500 consistently and I think I've found one(two actually). PHO and FIW, two etf's focused on water conservation and infrastructure.

About 70% of the earth's surface is covered in water, but 97% of it is saltwater, which is unfit for human use. Saltwater cannot be used for drinking, crop irrigation, or most industrial uses. Of the remaining 3% of the world's water resources, only about 1% is readily available for human consumption. This creates a demand for desalination infrastructure to solve the global water crisis as the population of the world rapidly rises by the day.

I was watching a TED talk that said in the future, wars will be waged over water. It simply isn't easy to transport and some areas have a lot more than others. For example, everything from steel to potato chips to computers uses water in the production. Did you know that we use 2400 liters of water to produce just one hamburger?

In fact, water futures were created last December because of the growing interest in water investing. If you look at the 13F filings on Whalewisdom you can see that water is also one of the fastest growing sectors among hedge funds.

**-The Big Short-**

I don't know if you guys remember, but Michael Burry said at the end of The Big Short that he is focused only on investing into water. The more due diligence I do on water(Ted talks, books, articles) the more I realize just how right Michael Burry is about this. Michael Burry is also investing in Farmland, along with Bill Gates who is now the world's biggest farmland owner. In addition, water will benefit from the imminent rising inflation due to the fed's QE. After all, it's an essential commodity.

**-Can't be replaced-**

Unlike tech companies which may go out of favor, water will always be essential and relevant to our lives. As the population of the world increases, tendies will flow into our pockets. I almost see this as a no-lose scenerio. Desalination is a necessity, there's no other way around it. The population growth creates the demand, and a growing population is easier to rely on than trying to anticipate consumer demand for something like Apple!

**-Very cheap leaps-**

As of now, you can get $5200 worth of leaps options on PHO for $200-300. Considering this has been rapidly outperforming the SPY, this is a tremendous bargain! FIW is actually better than PHO when you consider performance, however the options are less liquid. I would recommend FIW if you can find a decent price, otherwise PHO should suit you fine.

**-Conclusion-**

I'd advise everyone to do their own research. There's some fancy graphs and TED talk videos on Youtube. Blackrock and other top ETF's know about water and are highly invested. This ETF is one

of the secrets to my success for the last few years(the other being poor man's covered call on certain stable/fed-backed ETF's under low volatility).

My retirement $$$ is in my boring retirement Vanguard acct... set and forget. My joy is meandering through the stock market  generally buying longterm at least for 1 year due to tax implications. But most held for a lot longer.

For me I don't want it to become a job or stress me out. I want to learn and I want it to be fun. I jumped into Bitcoin and held for a long time and cashed out with a tidy profit to do something else. My husband has his own money and we have much different styles. But I jumped into dogecoin with my brother as a sibling type rivalry thing and it gave us something in common and something to rib each other about. He bowed out. I sold enough to cover taxes and my cost and I'm up $1,800. Even if I lose the rest, I really didn't lose. I'll sell a bit more if it goes to $0.50 and let the rest ride. Sister is coming out on top!

 I still have single shares of some stocks because I was too poor to buy more and it feels good to see 1 share of NVIDIA purchased @ $89...  it's like looking back at your kindergarden photos, I also have 21 shares of NVAX @ $4.47, 14 shares of SQ @$15... wish I had bought more but it is what it is. Lessons big and small. It also reminds me means I did some stuff right even on a tiny scale.

All time returns since 2016 I am at 330% balance around 15.5k

Take some small risks but this should not be with your rent money, use discretionary money that you can afford to lose and set a weekly amount and stick to it.  I started at around $12 a week. Patience and consistency is key but so is the enjoyment. I hope you have fun with it!",gw0h15w,t3_mz02ef

That said, I like GSAT and think they will be valuable in the future (I have some LEAPS in them that I'm fairly confident will print).  Would I buy the stock now at 1.36?  No way.  

In fact, just because I've seen this thing happen a bunch, I actually bought some $1p 5/21 expecting it to go down in the next few weeks.

There are some extremely high profile analysts that made themselves famous primarily from momentum trading. I think it has potential for being a decent strategy for new investors, if you are willing to do the research to understand the methods and you are extremely good at sticking to the rules of momentum investing. Maybe look up the investing strategy of Jesse Livermore as a good way to understand the basics of momentum trading, but the caution is in the life history because he died a tragic death and stated that he lost great sums of money because he was unable to follow his own rules for investing.",gvxxule,t3_mz02ef

With meme stocks it pays to buy them before the craze. I bought dogecoin at .069420 because I thought it was funny and because it had been stagnant for a while.

As another example, I bought Amazon after they announced they're acquiring Whole Foods because their stock remained stagnant at just under $1000 for weeks after the news and I had a feeling that the newly added value would be recognized eventually.

As a third example I bought some weed stocks recently such as YOLO. They're down about 33% - I bought at 30, it's at 20 - but I have a good feeling that they'll come back up in the long run.

Anyway I'd personally use a source of information other than trading platforms for my larger bets, because the fact that a security is being highlighted usually means the market is already in the midst of an adjustment that you missed out on.",gvyqan9,t1_gvyov9i

1657,1619410086.0,,RobinHood,,,,"If your state has income tax, then yes, you would  need to calculate taxes for both. $3000 is lower than the federal standard deduction, so when you calculate taxes it will be $0 (not $300). If that‚Äôs really your entire annual income then you‚Äôd owe no federal tax. Depending on the state that may be true for your state taxes too. Search ‚Äú<your state> standard deduction‚Äù and see.

Standard deduction is basically an amount you subtract from your income before calculating taxes. For federal 2020 it‚Äôs like $12,400. So if you make $3000 then $3000-$12400 is less than $0 so no tax! If you made $20,000 then $20,000-$12,400=$7,600 and you‚Äôd owe tax on that $7,600 amount (you‚Äôd look up $7600 in the tax table and pay whatever it said is the tax for that).

""As long as you don't have a type of income that requires you to file a return for other reasons, like self-employment income, generally you don't need to file a return as long as your income is less than your standard deduction.

For example, in 2020, you don't need to file a tax return if all of the following are true for you:

* Under age 65
* Single
* Don't have any special circumstances that require you to file (like self-employment income)
* **Earn less than $12,400 (which is the 2020 standard deduction for a single taxpayer)""**

And in most states taxes are due quarterly so if you realized gain in Jan you'd owe taxes on those profits wherever your Q1 tax payments are due. If you don't pay until you file your federal return at the end of the year you'll owe non payment penalties.

The vast majority of people work for a company that withholds and sends your tax payments to the government on a regular basis. But independent contractors, small business owners, gig workers, and cash employees have always been responsible for sending quarterly tax payments on their income.

1719,1619472093.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Taxable income = short term salary income + short term capital gains from <1 year stock position + long term capital gains from >1 year stock position.

Taxable income determines whether your long term gains is taxed at 0% or 15%. Fed taxes is zero for the first 40k of long term capital gains. 

I didn't make any money from a job last year. So, my taxable income = 0 + 0 +  long term capital gains of 40k.

Let's use an example of someone with 35K salary, 2k stock short term gains and 10k long term gains

The salary and stock short term gains will be taxed like normal income. This amounts to 37k. Now you have space for $3k worth of long term capital gains left. 

The first 3k will be taxed at 0%, while the next 7k will be taxed at 15%.

In other words, there's actually an incentive in the Fed Taxation rule for you to avoid realizing short term gains or have a regular job.

A jobless retiree with a massive portfolio of stocks can just slowly sell off 40K of stocks every year for your living expense with zero fed tax, and zero state tax (assuming you live in a tax free state). Also, this 40k number keeps increasing by a few hundred dollars too. Use that free money and live in a 3rd world country where expenses are 1/10 of the US. 

You said that you live in CA like me, so we both are screwed by the capital gains taxation of California. Short term/long term capital gains are treated identically, which is why I am paying that $800+. Definitely considering to move to Nevada soon, where that number is 0.",gvz7amm,t1_gvv8dsb

It's shocking how many people are under the impression that SMS is secure.  It's not; not in any way, shape or form.

If you use SMS/texts, then essentially everyone on the entire SS7 network can see your messages.  It's like sending unsecured packets over the internet, it's just a stupid thing to do.  NO ONE should be using SMS for security purposes!

There is an argument that it's better than nothing, but even that is questionable because being lulled into a false sense of security might very well be worse, because then you let your guard down \*thinking\* you're secure when you're not.  

Are you better off or worse off having a screen door if a burglar comes to your home?  If you don't have a screen door, you're far more likely to have your front door closed and locked.  If you have a screen door then you may very well lock the screen door, but because it's not really secure, it's not protecting you.

2FA is a great idea.  2FA over SMS is a \*terrible\* idea.  The only reason it's being used is because nearly everyone has a phone number that can receive texts and they know how to find them.  It's laziness on the part of banks and financial organizations.",gw8vfza,t3_mx2fvy

No, it shouldn't. If your bank is purposefully misunderstanding ACH transfers and you know you've correctly entered your checking account number rather than the savings account number, they are likely doing it to violate Regulation D with the intent of charging you transaction fees (after 6 transactions/month). This and overdraft fees (overdraft protection enabled by default) are becoming common again after the last administration started flirting with the idea of striking decade old rules at the CFPB back in 2019. It got so serious that laws [were even drafted to patch it from the legislative side](https://maloney.house.gov/issues/protecting-consumers/overdraft) just in case. It's not a grey area.

Just taking numbers into account -

You‚Äôve sold a put @8 and recd @0.26. This means you‚Äôre bullish on the price and saying that price will be 8 or above.
Selling a put limits your upside so your max profit will be the selling price I.e. 0.26$
And your max loss will be -(8-0)+0.26 = -7.74$

You can calculate your net payoff on expiration date as -(8-X)+.26 where X is price at expiration

You have 2 options -
1. Play it out till the expiration date
2. buying cover (netting off) your put option now (given the numbers above you‚Äôll make a loss of .38-.26 =-0.12

Selling Puts is nothing wrong that you collect money upfront, and hope your option expire worthless so you can keep the money collected only if the stock price goes above your strike price. Here‚Äôs my advice just for your reference: 

1. Wait the day before or on the day your option expires, if still losing money, Roll your option to the later week or weeks, so you hope the stock price will go back up above your strike price. To roll option, Simply click Roll Option button on your trading platform. I made a mistake before by not knowing that function, simply clicked buy back, but never sell again which costed me tons of money. 

2. Close your option once the stock price bounce back and above your cost. or based on your own judgement of the stock direction, set your profit target, either keep part of premium to close the put by buying back, or wait until the option expire worthless and keep full premium you collected. The only risk is you never know if the stock goes to the direction you wanted or not. 

Go to Youtube search option trading to educate yourself, there are tons of videos.

Take the SPY chart (or S&P 500 or any other major index).  Put it on a 5 year graph.  If you squint your eyes you'll notice that you can pretty much draw a fairly straight line from 5 years ago to today and that the actual value of SPY is fairly close to it.  You could do a graph with a longer time frame, but then you'd have to take in account compound growth, inflation, other crashes, and various other factors.

[https://imgur.com/a/zVyeLmd](https://imgur.com/a/zVyeLmd)

So what has happened in the last 3 months?  We have caught up to around where the market would have been if the crash had not happened.  We are even slightly above where the market ""should have been"" if you strictly follow the straight line idea.

My theory is that stock prices have been recovering so quickly that the stock prices have gone above the actual value of the stocks.  I fully expect the market to be stagnant or go down slightly within the next few months until we catch back up.  The market doesn't normally grow at 75-100% in a year.

I'm not someone who looks at charts, but I'm a W.B. walking into a shop and asking which food is the most popular and its brand. Having received the answer, I buy those shares and wait for them to go up. But there is a value that cannot be found neither on charts, nor on financial statements, nor in shops: human value and potential.

I am not referring to the CEO or the CFO but to the people who make the company at the lower levels. I am referring to their behaviors, their attachment to work and the brand. What company is it that its employees are afraid of saying they are wrong if they are then fired. Better silence and go as it goes. There is a story that I invite you to read, and make yours for the future, a true story that can make you unique Redditors: The Story of a lost USB key from a leading company and of a person who found it. I'm not telling you more because you have to find this story on the internet. Then if you can't find it, ask me where to find it and I'll see if you can let you know.

You go to the farmers market to buy some seeds from a seed farmer, pay for it, and off you go.

Now you got yourself some produce, you want to sell them and make some money.

You go back to the market this time as a seller, you make a transaction,sell some produce, and you pay tax on it. 

You sell/make another transaction, pay tax on that, so on and on. 

If you don‚Äôt sell some produces and keep them, no tax needs to be paid as they are yours and they could continue to grow/or store. (terrible analogy now).

Edit- 
keep in mind, 1 year or less of holding any GAINS and sell = higher tax, 1 year or more of holding any GAINS before selling = less tax.

2637,1618867107.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Wash sales aside, the taxman doesn‚Äôt really care how many or the exact nature of the trades it took you to make a profit.

Think about it this way:

Let‚Äôs say you started the year with $50K.  You bought some asset and then sold it at $60K.  Sweet, you just made a $10K profit, as per your example.

You invest more money and then make another $2K.  So now you have a total of $62K cash.

The taxman says, you had $50K and now you have $62K.  That‚Äôs $12K profit.  We‚Äôll take the tax on that, thank you very much.

Now, one exception to this rule might be if you straddle tax years.  For example, let‚Äôs suppose that you bought the initial $50K asset in March 2019, sold for $60K in April. Then you purchased $10K in December 2019 and sold for $12K in January 2020.

Depending on your individual tax situation, it‚Äôs possible that the $10K profit would be counted in the 2019 tax year and the additional $2K would be counted in 2020.

Longterm capital gains (held for at least 1 year) have their own tax brackets (which are set by your income level). Short term capital gains are usually taxed as an addition to your normal income. That being said, when you are only taxed in the gains you make, so in your example the 10k you make initially and then the subsequent 2k would be the tax base. Assuming you have already paid taxes on or are tax exempt from the money you used to invest initially the IRS will never tax you on income you‚Äôve already paid your taxes on (theres a few exceptions). Another thing, if you take a loss on an asset you held for three months, that will lower the short-term capital gains tax base that you have.

(You take losses because you can offset gains with losses.)  You sell it for $50 and pick it back up for $50 the same day (or within 31 days) thinking you can apply the loss against the gain and report $0 gain to the IRS and owe no taxes.  That is not the case.   The sale and repurchase of the stock within 31 days is considered a ‚Äúwash sale‚Äù and that loss is not reportable as a loss to the IRS.  You still owe taxes on the $50.  Now you have lowered your cost basis of the $100 stock that you sold for $50 but not to worry because that loss is added to your cost basis and it still looks like you paid $100 for capital gain purposes.,gv4tppd,t1_gv3xedw

Not exactly true, but pretty close. All you have to do is sell the replacement shares incurred from the wash transaction before the end of the year, i.e. December 31. The easiest way to do this is to just close out your entire position that you have wash sales in.

Then do not buy back for 30 days after the fact. So if you sold on December 30, do not buy back until January 31. To be safe, I'd wait a few extra days.

This is why you get your tax docs in February. Your broker has to be sure you didn't buy back in during January.",gv76bvo,t1_gv5oiiv

We all know Peloton as the popular home-workout brand. Is the company purely a covid play or were they always destined for success? WallStreet seems to valuate the company as a low-margin hardware company, but should that really be the case? We‚Äôll go through some of the ins and outs of the company‚Äôs metrics, potential risks, catalysts, and a look at the company‚Äôs growth as the world re-opens from lockdowns.

**Covid play or is this the new trend?**

It could be debated that Peloton would not be where they are today without covid and the global lockdowns that occurred. However, were they truly a covid play or did the virus simply speed up the process of them becoming a home-workout powerhouse? The world is re-opening, but demand for their bikes are still at peak. The CEO noted in their latest earnings call (Feb-04-2021) that even with the vaccine roll-out demand for the bike has not decreased.

‚ÄúWe still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. We haven't seen any softening of demand.‚Äù

A look at Google search trends for the term ‚ÄúPeloton‚Äù as well as their traffic estimation from high-end SEO tools would also suggest that demand has remained consistent.

https://preview.redd.it/pu09rcxfvxt61.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=08832587d10645ce7759e2cac9bc76d177236eff

&#x200B;

Peloton has been accurate with their next-quarter guidance and they‚Äôve been beating estimates consistently, but they seem to slightly sand-bag full-year guidance creating ‚Äúeasy beats‚Äù. Let‚Äôs go through a few factors that make Peloton the strong company that they are, and a deep dive into some of the growth they can expect post-covid.

**Brand Loyalty** 

Peloton has succeeded in becoming the go-to name for in-home cycling classes, and as they expand, the in-home workout leader. Their brand-loyalty also rivals some of the best of the best. When looking at the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is a ranking of brand loyalty, Peloton has a score in the high 90‚Äôs which is a greater score than BOTH Apple and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/yyuwhwehvxt61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd6838be56deb1e3f136871b78d6b2b8e0a8edb

This is attributed to the high-quality content the company pushes to end-users through their pre-recorded and live classes. Users always have plenty of options when it comes to taking classes with their favorite instructors. Their NPS score is even more evident with the churn-rate Peloton experiences on memberships. Is the churn-rate really that important? In this industry, yes, and in my opinion this is what will differentiate Peloton as more of a tech valuation instead of ‚Äújust‚Äù a hardware company.

To give you reference of how good Peloton‚Äôs churn rate is, let‚Äôs compare it to Apple TV+ and Netflix. First, the ‚Äúchurn‚Äù is the rate of attrition the company experiences over a time-period. Basically it means how often they are **losing** customers. AppleTV+ has a [20% churn rate](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/), which is quite high, while Netflix has a [churn rate of 3%](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/). So what was Peloton‚Äôs churn rate last quarter? 0.76%, some of the lowest levels in *any* industry. The company has consistently had churn under 1% since the Pandemic began, and they expect churn to remain under 0.80% for the foreseeable future. You must remember that this number affects the *recurring revenue* source for the company, which is critical for them.

**Big revenue growth, almost no profits. What gives?**

While it‚Äôs true that Peloton has been having blow-out quarter after blow-out quarter, they have just barely been profitable. Last quarter (Q2-2021), they did a mere $63.6 million of net income [**on over a billion in revenue**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549). Doesn‚Äôt look great from the outside, but we have to remember that this company has been selling every single bike they‚Äôve ever produced and can barely keep up with the high demand over the last 4 quarters. They‚Äôve invested aggressively into the expansion of their [**supply chain infrastructure**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/) and recently they [**acquired Precor**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor), another fitness chain with strong connections to hotels and gyms, for $420 million. The Precor acquisition will substantially increase domestic manufacturing capabilities for their bike and tread product. Here‚Äôs a look at the current OTD (order-to-delivery) times within the USA, from the Peloton website.

https://preview.redd.it/kwnbtizivxt61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96981504fb19209f11e56ef8bd49795c8d5eaf0

We can see that even after exponentially increasing their production capacity over the last year customers still need to wait weeks or months to receive the product. Peloton has been working hard to get delivery times down to the desired 1-2 weeks. Management noted that with these aggressive supply chain investments they will be able to get there by Q3 or Q4, 2021. Management commented on OTD times in their last earnings call.

‚Äúthe successes that we're seeing in getting the order to delivery down and getting our backlog down are 100% based on incredible upgrades, and our manufacturing capacity up to over six times --¬†6x increase in just the last 12 months in our capacity of them know -- we're now making more Bikes on a monthly basis than we did in all of fiscal 2018‚Äù

Due to covid there‚Äôs been a lot of delays (unloading times 4x longer than a year ago) at the west coast port-of-entry that has forced Peloton to re-schedule many deliveries. Another reason why net profits have been affected to such an extant is that Peloton has already started what they expect to be over 100 million expenditure in expediting shipments using more expensive methods (air freight). From the CC:

‚ÄúThough we're beginning to see the benefits of our extensive supply chain investments, our delivery wait times remain elevated‚Ä¶ we are investing over $100 million in expedited shipping to reduce the wait times for our products.

But what I can say is that we do expect that this $100 million, which we recognize is a very large investment. We believe will get us back to normal shipping protocol by the end of this fiscal year‚Ä¶ the expedited shipping investment brings down OTD. And that gets inventory into warehouses, which is going to allow us to get aggressive with marketing really for the first time‚Äù

**Risks to the downside**

I‚Äôm seeing a few notable risks that might have a negative effect on the company. I‚Äôll go through them here:

**Cheaper Competition:** we have a less ‚Äúpremium‚Äù brand also entering the scene with NordicTrack now providing similar products at a much lower cost.

**Long delivery times:** It‚Äôs only natural that when you go to the checkout page for your brand new Peloton bike and see a delivery time of nearly 2-3 months you might be turned away to a competitor (such as the NordicTrack, ProForm, or SoulCycle bike). However, like we mentioned earlier is that Peloton has extremely high brand loyalty. People want a Peloton, just like they prefer Apple iPhone over Samsung (or vice versa), or Lululemon clothing instead of the off-brand (and much cheaper) at Walmart.

**Re-opening risks:** As the world re-opens the risk of churn becomes higher as well. However, it is my opinion that gym-goers will maintain both their gym membership as well as their Peloton membership. This is not a ‚Äúone or the other‚Äù case. I would not be surprised if Peloton subscriber churn rate stayed under 1% as everything re-opens. A risk to the company none-the-less.

**Low-margin equipment sales:** Back in August 2020, Peloton CEO noted that each bike is sold at nearly break-even, meaning they don‚Äôt make any money on the sale. The true net-profit will be locking the user into the Peloton content ecosystem. He also stated that due to the economies of scale they are creating that eventually (and most likely already), they will be making a profit on each bike sold. He also mentions on the Q1 2021 earnings call that both the original Bike and the Bike+ have extremely similar margins. Peloton doesn‚Äôt disclose the specific mix of their products that attribute to revenues and how many treads were sold vs bikes vs Bike+, but I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that each of their products will have similar margins.

**Freight Pricing Pressure:** This has been quite a challenge for the company. They‚Äôve been maneuvering through logistics issues and have dedicated $100 million to reducing the OTD times to keep new customers happy. Due to covid, this freight pricing pressure might continue for the rest of the year and possibly longer. Management has noted that their forward guidance does already include these inefficiencies, which is obvious because the company‚Äôs growth in 2020 would have been much stronger had it been able to fulfill every single order it had on the books.

**Over-investment into supply chain:** There are also some risks associated with all these supply chain investments the company is making. Right now it seems like a smart play to keep up with the demand of bikes and treads, but at what cost? 420 million Precor acquisition, an extra 100 million investment in expediting shipments, further investments into their Taiwan manufacturing site are all cutting deeply into margins. There is risk that 2-3 years from now they have more supply than demand and the question of the validity of these supply-chain investments may come up. However, in my opinion, Peloton management has been doing a great job at managing the difficulties not only with logistics through covid, but also with the explosive growth the company has seen.

**Potential Catalysts**

**International Expansion**

Until now Peloton has been laser-focused on the U.S market. They‚Äôve been slowly [expanding into Europe and Canada](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-expands-to-europe-and-canada-300644577.html), and have just recently opened up the tread market in United Kingdom. From their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had some positive comments to say about European markets:

‚ÄúU.K. Tread sales have exceeded our expectations, and our early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.‚Äù

The demand for Peloton is highest in the United States at the moment, but that doesn‚Äôt go to say the product can‚Äôt succeed internationally. In my opinion, *when* demand in the U.S starts to decrease it will be off-set by the increase of growth in international markets.

**More on the Precor Acquisition**

Going back a bit more on the Precor acquisition. This was a strategic move by management and will have a two-fold positive effect on the company. The first is that delivery times will finally be shortened with the wide manufacturing footprint that will be created in the U.S. This will also alleviate stress of high shipping costs that the company has incurred. The Precor deal and having a U.S based factory should lead to better performance for Peloton‚Äôs bottom line. Second, Precor has very good relationships with channels that Peloton has not yet penetrated. This will help Peloton gain instant-access to some very lucrative end-markets, which include schools, clubs, hotels, and gyms. When asked about the Precor acquisition on their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had to say:

‚Äúit's been enormous curiosity about what this could mean in terms of delivering a combined Precor Peloton experience in the commercial channel‚Äù

They want to get Peloton into all these channels and the possibilities are endless.

**Economies of Scale**

It‚Äôs evident the company has been bogged down by extensive costs and ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù. They‚Äôve maneuvered through the Pandemic and are meeting extremely high demand by spending a lot more on shipping and getting product from their factory in Taiwan to the warehouse in the United States. They also have large expenditures on creating content, hiring instructors, and maintaining the quality of product. All this to keep users engaged. With the Precor acquisition, these expenses will become a lower percent of the revenue generated as margins are increased and revenue increases.

**Valuation**

There are quite a few topics I want to touch base on in terms of the company‚Äôs valuation. I think if we were to use a benchmark of value, we could look at Nautilus Inc (NLS), which is a fitness equipment manufacturing company, is currently trading at 1x trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenues‚Ä¶ On the other side of things, you have tech stocks trading at incredibly high valuations all because they are bringing in high-margin recurring revenue. So the debate will be low-margin hardware versus high-margin recurring revenue. Peloton fits somewhere in the middle.

WallStreet‚Äôs main concerns for Peloton are going to be over the company‚Äôs margins, and the longevity of the increased ‚Äúcovid‚Äù demand. The big question is, what happens when demand slows? After-all, the market is a forward-looking. I want to look at this in two ways. The first is going to be international expansion off-setting a slow in growth in the United States. The second is going to be a look at the recurring revenues and continued subscriber growth over the next 2-3 years.

**Demand**

As with any product, the demand for Peloton products will eventually plateau. Peloton has done well by releasing the new treadmill product, with rumors of a rowing machine and other in-home fitness equipment. I would not be surprised to see Peloton develop a very robust product line. However, as growth slows in one segment (bikes) a new segment will open up (tread/rower/other products). With 2 million in cash on the balance sheet Peloton is in a great position to expand their brand into other segments both in the domestic USA and internationally.

Peloton‚Äôs expansion internationally is still in the very early stages as they‚Äôve only just began to penetrate these markets. Like I touched up on previously, the increased demand internationally will off-set some of the growth slowing in the United States. The end-goal of the company is to increase margins on their hardware products, while selling a lot of it, and then locking users into their ecosystem with the recurring subscription which will be a big money-maker for them.

**Subscriptions**

The subscription revenues, which currently have a 60% gross profit, are going un-noticed with the company‚Äôs valuation. In their most recent quarter (Q2-2021) they did over 1.064 billion in revenue. From that revenue, approximately 81.7% came from sales of bikes, treads, and other products in their ‚Äúconnected fitness‚Äù segment. The other 18.3% came from subscription revenue. Their ‚Äúconnected fitness‚Äù and ‚Äúsubscription revenue‚Äù segments also come in with gross profits of 35.3%, and 60.3%, respectively.

Their guidance for Q3-2021 had similar performance to last quarter, where they guided another billion in revenue and an additional 300m subscribers to their network. This is also coming off their holiday season quarter, which generally provides an additional boost in sales. In my opinion, I think it would be safe to assume that continued high demand in the U.S market, with growing international exposure will get the company doing $2 billion in revenue per quarter. Remember that 18.3% of that revenue is recurring from their subscription model. This would generate about $366 million in subscription revenue per quarter, and on a twelve-month basis approximately $1.47 billion per year. Here‚Äôs a look at their Q2-2021 revenue and subscriber growth.

https://preview.redd.it/no1s4xkkvxt61.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d9030c404791abd6563d9ef13c605fd7a20279

Peloton currently has a market cap of $32 billion. *If* the company were to achieve $2 billion revenues per quarter in 1-2 years, which in my opinion is quite probable, then at current valuations they would be trading at 4x sales, with 20% of that coming from recurring subscriptions. Don‚Äôt forget they have a strong balance sheet with just over 2 million in cash assets for future investments.

I like the stock and would like to invest in it while it is trading at a market cap below 10-15x revenues. At that same valuation today they would be priced at $180 instead of $110.

**TLDR;**

1. The company has had blowout quarter after blowout quarter, but barely turning a profit. They have been experiencing ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù and invested heavily into their supply chain infrastructure. $420 million Precor acquisition, $100 million in *additional* expedited shipping costs, and digital content production have cut heavily into their margins.
2. They are doing $1 billion revenues per quarter and with steady growth they might get up to $2 billion per quarter in 2022. Approximately 20% of that revenue will be *recurring* revenue from their fitness subscription model. Not only that, but they are also adding 300m new subscribers to their ecosystem each quarter. 
3. With all these supply chain infrastructure upgrades they are still selling every single bike they can produce. Management noted that demand has remained high even with global vaccine roll-outs. They are just getting their feet wet with international markets, which could provide another boost in demand.
4. There are a few concerns about the company moving forward, such as: low margin product, over-investment in new factories and acquisitions, long delivery times turning customers to competitors, and re-opening risks. We‚Äôve addressed these above.
5. If the company can prove they are more than a ‚Äúhardware‚Äù manufacturing company WallStreet will give them the proper valuation. They are currently on track to have over 2m paying members to their integrated fitness model and I would not be surprised if they hit over 3-4 million members by 2022.",Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD),14.0,,,

2826,1620568024.0,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is‚Ä¶ Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird‚Äôs eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people‚Äôs money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here‚Äôs a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having ‚Äúfun‚Äù. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",163.0,,,

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough. 

Thanks",Capital gains tax period with mergers,91.0,,,
2925,1620416868.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I doubt you need to see an accountant.  Most stock for stock mergers in the US are tax-free (which means the holding period doesn't restart) to shareholders, but there are requirements that must be met for tax-free treatment.  There are three ways to figure out whether the acquisition qualified (assuming you are in the US, and the companies are in the US):

\- Easiest - find the press release for the merger, which should say whether the merger will be tax-free for investors).  If it doesn't say, don't assume it will be taxable, but use one of the other ways.

\- Find the tax disclosure in the merger proxy.  Look up the old company on the SEC's website using EDGAR.  Find the DEFM14A, which is the merger proxy.  Search for ""tax"".  There will be a few pages on tax consequences, but best to find the FAQs (usually called ""Question and Answers"") or the comment in the Summary re taxes

\- Send a message to RH and they should be able to tell you when your holding period started

Note, any cash received would most likely be taxable. 

An example of a merger proxy is here:

2926,1620415098.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You should be able to just look at your capital gains/losses to-date.  They (the broker) have to specify for tax purposes whether the capital gain or loss of any transaction is short term or long term.   I'm no longer on Robinhood so I'm not sure if you can just look that up or if you have to request your paperwork with them.  If you see that your shares are not showing as long-term, that's Robinhood's problem, as they are required to give you accurate data for tax purposes.  Bring it up with them if there's a problem.  I know I can look at all of my gains/losses broken into short and long term at any time with my current broker.   A merger or other ticker change does not change your date of purchase or cost basis.  Note:  I have not experienced this first-hand, so of course consult a tax professional if your gains still show as short term (assuming you even sold them and the issue comes up).",gxb3aux,t3_n75o8q
2927,1620414456.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Assume you're in the US? I think what you're saying is you're trying to avoid SHORT TERM cap gains right?

2928,1620417755.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You're good.

No capital gains, until you sell the new stock. I've had this happen to me several times before. 

The catch is if it is a cash to shareholders or partial cash to shareholds in the transaction, you will have to pay capital gains on the cash. If it is less then a year short-term gains rules apply.

This isn't uncommon as the buying company only gives even unsplit shares out and the pricing dictated some people ended up with 5.33 shares. The company might give you 5 shares of the new stock and the value of 0.33 shares in cash. You would then have capitol gains on that cash.

&#x200B;

The safest way to check is post-merge check your brokerage account. There will be a section that is called something along the line of ""Realized Gain/Loss"" and you can see your list of gains and losses taken for the year as they occur. You might need to be on the website version of your brokerage account access.

I can see where I had a cash gain due to these partial shares being paid in cash right now in my account in 2020.

In 2020, I had another stock sold to another company that was an all-cash offer, and I had to take capital gains on the year that buy-out of the company happened. 

It will also show you if you had a holding go completely bankrupt and was completely devalued. You can't control when you take that loss, unless you sell it in advance.

&#x200B;

Another scenario, it can also show you. Slightly more complex. I owned Yahoo a few years ago. They old off assets from their primary company, but they also owned stocks in other companies. The biggest was Alibaba. When Yahoo went out of business the stock turned into a holding company with no long-term intention to be an investment company. Over time they sold off their assets and gave shareholders cash directly. I can't control when they distribute that cash, but I pay capitol gains on that in the year they pay me. Oddly enough, these things can take years sometimes and it can become hard to sell off these companies when they are no longer listed in a stock exchange and they become smaller. I usually try to get out of these companies before they get to that point.",gxb90fl,t3_n75o8q

From what i‚Äôve learned it seems that diversification works well for someone looking to grow their money over a long period of time.

Seems like a pretty safe bet long term to either break even or sky like bitcoin, so i added some to my portfolio.

VONG is tech heavy, so no need for VTG.  I don't like MSOS, expense ratio is too high for me.  I consider it high risk and high expense so I would dump it.  I think ETH is a little high, but that is me.  No more than 10% of a portfolio should be in crypto, but that's my personal opinion.",gxkuk4f,t1_gxb61qd

2955,1620433846.0,,RobinHood,,,,Youre taxed on your total gains. If you invested $500 and lost some and remade it back at $600 you will have $100 to report if you would cash out. Remember under a year you pay a higher tax rate than over a year.,gxc54r9,t1_gxbxjfq

2957,1620307509.0,n677o1,RobinHood,"Honestly this post may come off very ignorant and I‚Äôm sorry in advance I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not digging a hole for myself without even realizing it. 

So I setup a Robinhood account last night and I linked it to my bank and put money into my Robinhood account. I got a free stock and I put some money into dogecoin. So my questions are

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.


Edit- Thanks everyone who replied! I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many very helpful and not rude comments. I was expecting to get bashed to all hell",Will I end up owing money?,250.0,,,
2958,1620308797.0,,RobinHood,,,,"If you are on a (free) cash account, it is impossible that you will owe money, as you will only be able to use what you deposit (buying power), you can only buy what you have the available buying power for and whatever you buy can only go to $0, not negative.

If you are on an (free) instant account, when you start a transfer to Roninhood, they make the $ amount instantly available to you for trading, even though it hasn't been withdrawn from your bank yet. So the only way you can owe money is if you start a transfer but it gets returned insufficient funds from your bank, and they will reverse the transfer.

On both free accounts, interest isn't paid, its earned. I have a 0.3% interest rate (be aware that is zero point three percent, as in less than 1 percent, not 30 percent), and you will accrue interest monthly on any cash in your Robinhood portfolio. 

Only when you start borrowing money from them can you end up owing money, and even then, unless you literally are spending money you KNOW you don't have, it will be difficult to go in the negative.",gx5e3iq,t3_n677o1
2959,1620308756.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You will get a tax form for the free stock and you will owe on anything you sell, but only in the part of how much you profited.",gx5e0e1,t3_n677o1

2961,1620308645.0,,RobinHood,,,,Do not use margin that‚Äôs it. You can‚Äôt owe money other than that.,gx5druc,t3_n677o1
2962,1620309076.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You‚Äôll have to see if you have margin enabled. To do that, click on the Account button and go to Investing. 

You should see something called Margin Investing - check and ensure that it‚Äôs disabled. If you enable Margin Investing, you‚Äôre essentially trading on borrowed funds, where you‚Äôll owe 2.5% flat interest rate on anything above $1000. 

You could end up owing money in two ways:

1. If you have margin enabled, where you trade on borrowed money and you don‚Äôt profit and end up owing RH money. If this happens, you‚Äôll get a ‚Äúmargin call‚Äù to make up for the funds. 
2. If you play with some sophisticated options like credit spreads, which may not go your way. 

Obviously these are not the only ways but if you are simply transferring funds and buying and selling stocks, you‚Äôll likely be fine.

Just steer clear of options as a beginner investor and spend time learning how things work.",gx5ep7w,t3_n677o1
2963,1620309235.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You would owe money by buying on margin - which is where they lend you money to buy currency or stock  (so don't do that and you won't owe money)

APY interest is most likely the interest they will charge if they lend you money (called a margin account)

So if you just buy stock or currency with the cash in your account you will never owe them money  (you might lose it but you will never get a margin call)",gx5f1jp,t3_n677o1
2964,1620310731.0,,RobinHood,,,,You will owe taxes on the profits that you make when you sell,gx5ib65,t3_n677o1
2965,1620310655.0,,RobinHood,,,,Also remember that you will have to pay capital gains tax on any profit you make from selling stocks or crypto. You pay 30% on anything you sell and have owned for less than 1 year. You pay 15% on anything you sell and have owned for over 1 year.,gx5i4zp,t3_n677o1
2966,1620308753.0,,RobinHood,,,,Unless you purchase on margin you can't end up owing more than you put in. It may be possible with certain options transactions but Im not sure on that if your just starting out it's best to avoid options.,gx5e04p,t3_n677o1
2967,1620388646.0,,RobinHood,,,,"All you need to know is this: Never sell naked puts or calls, and you probably will never owe money.",gx9hv3w,t3_n677o1
2968,1620383148.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Let's say you invest 10 dollars of your own money (transferred from your own banking account) into a stock, or crypto with a worth of 100 dollars. Now, worst case scenario, the stock, or crypto plummets to be worth half of what it was when you invested your 10 dollars - now your investment is worth 5 dollars - should you decide to sell it. Vice versa, If your investment doubles in worth (now it worth 200 dollars) the ten dollars you invested would be worth double. To sum it up, if your investing your own money;

A. You will never owe money from your loses - should you decide to sell your investment back at a lower price.

B. If you sell your stock, or crypto at a higher price in which you get a profit, you will owe taxes on what you earned as a ""short term capitol gain"". (Example, your investment from 10 dollars went to 20, and you sold. You will owe taxes on the 10 dollars earned)

C. Golden rule, only invest money you are willing to lose, until you get the hang of it. 

I hope this helps!",gx9af7r,t3_n677o1
2969,1620308997.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Owing money?  You won't owe money. All you can do is lose your investment.  The only thing you can owe is taxes if you make a lot of money of your investments.

2970,1620347345.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I don‚Äôt think this post came off as ignorant but you certainly should do some research about investing basics before you enter the arena. 

SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is extremely worried about robinhood and other brokers ability to lure in people like you who don‚Äôt know what they are doing. 

Answer to your question seems to be cleared up already but as long as you aren‚Äôt trading with margin you can only lose what you put into it. 

I wouldn‚Äôt invest in doge though as again you need to do some research.",gx7urkh,t3_n677o1
2971,1620310230.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Hi, you won't end up owing money if you disable margin.
However, you can still LOSE money, so please don't buy things like Dogecoin without proper knowledge. (stick to safer things as a beginner)",gx5h6u8,t3_n677o1
2972,1620309135.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Why in the world would opening an account and getting a free stock make you owe money? Who do you think you owe? Why do you _want_ to owe money?

THAT IS TO RIG IT SO U SELL N A BILLIONARE WILL BUY N IT WILL GO UP.... anything you read just do opposite this worlds fucked up ALMOST AS much as the market.

The good news is that the other 70% I lost was mostly only gains from the 30% profit. 

You can go full retard on options if you‚Äôve got the gains to spend.

2999,1620318544.0,,RobinHood,,,,"This may get downvoted, but it‚Äôs wrong to tell new users that options are bad outright. Options are a useful tool if you have done your research and are within your risk tolerance. There‚Äôs an unhealthy amount of ‚ÄúYOLO‚Äù options posts on subs like /r/options and WSB, but the demonization of options in general is just as unhealthy. It‚Äôs like telling your adolescent child not to take drugs or smoke cigarettes *without explaining why that behavior carries risk.*

That said, if you are new to trading you don‚Äôt want to dip your feet into options until you 1) Have studied and understand the different types of options and how they work (lots of resources on YouTube) 2) Have done an adequate amount of research on the particular stock you want to place an option on, and 3) Have a decent amount in your brokerage account (usually around $10,000) because some of them do carry risk of losing money. 

People do options because you can make a substantial amount of money in a short amount of time, but learn to walk before you preform a gymnastic floor routine. If options were easy, absolutely everybody would be trading instead of working.",gx60m9a,t1_gx5kh2z

3004,1620326421.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You own AMZN at $4,000 on December 15th and sell AMZN for $2000 (-$2000).

You rebuy AMZN at $2000 on December 16th and sell AMZN for $4,000 on December 31st ($2,000).

For the tax season of that year you owe taxes on the $2,000 that you made but cannot claim the $2,000 you lost.

If you day trade and do this many times your losses won't help you on that year of taxes but your gains will still owe taxes. So if you trade a million times and make $1 every other trade and lose $1 every other trade you need to pay taxes on $500,000 you made although in reality you have $0 in your pocket. 

 It's important to note that if you're more than 30 days before Jan 1 this doesn't matter at all. This is to prevent people from selling at a loss and buying the security right back so they can show a loss on their taxes and still own the security.",gx6joay,t1_gx65no0

3011,1620413897.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Not OP but I would think it's because most forces are trying to drive the prices up, so puts are already at a disadvantage. The company itself is trying to do things that make the price go higher, sometimes the government is taking action to try to keep the overall stock market going up, etc. Overall the odds are already against you to start with.

Plus, just think about the price of the stock itself. It goes down when lots of people sell it, but people have to own the stock before they can sell it, so you can typically keep an eye on stuff like that based on the numbers, rumors, etc. You can get a somewhat decent idea of the risk level of a selloff when buying a call. However, a stock goes up when people are buying, and you have no way of knowing when someone out there is about to make a massive purchase that is going to drive the price up, or when the company is going to make an announcement that will cause a buying frenzy, etc. all of which can come out of nowhere and completely screws you over if you have a put. (yes, there are some negative announcements that can come out to make a price drop suddenly, but those seem to be more rare than good announcements that cause big climbs).",gxb0q95,t1_gx7gf17

I buy it again the next day at $900. It goes to $1000 and I sell. Profit $100.

This means I pay taxes on the $100 gain but don‚Äôt offset anything with the $100 loss? Even though I am net $0?

EDIT: in other words, to avoid this issue, if I sell at a loss I MUST not buy the same stock for at least 30 days?

Also what about the reverse situation...
Buy at $900, sell at $1000. 
Next day buy at $1000 sell at $900.

No capital gains tax on the $100 gained but benefit from $100 loss? Or it only works to the IRS‚Äôs favor?",gx6itsa,t1_gx6db2y

Wash sales apply throughout the year, if you‚Äôre in and out of a stock all year long, those wash sales will be disallowed regardless of being before or after 11/30.

You still have to claim the gain but cannot claim the loss.  The order of the transactions doesn't matter. The rule is that if you purchase the same stock within 30 days (before or after) of selling it, you cannot realize the loss. It's factored into the stock's cost basis instead.",gx8mqt4,t1_gx6itsa

3097,1620132244.0,,RobinHood,,,,Great news for STIC today!  It‚Äôs a SPAC and in the final stages of approval to become BARK. May be worth taking a look before everyone jumps onboard after the conversion.,gwwf1s5,t3_n4klpa
3098,1620140763.0,,RobinHood,,,,Why robinhood changed my vxx calls ta vxx1? Vxx1 doesnt exist lol,gwwxsmk,t3_n4klpa
3099,1620145100.0,,RobinHood,,,,I love when people don't know what limit orders are and haven't discovered what the ask and bid are but imagine it's a fee.,gwx8h9n,t1_gwx7cla
3100,1620148668.0,,RobinHood,,,,They don't.,gwxhfqi,t1_gwxdc5a
3101,1620149058.0,,RobinHood,,,,Gained money when you sold the stock - pay taxes (This is called realised gain.) You pay taxes regardless of whether you transfer them to your bank account. Realised gains can be subjected to capital gains tax,gwxidoq,t1_gwxfk01
3102,1620148855.0,,RobinHood,,,,Your friend is right.  When you sell a stock you will be taxed on any gains you've made.,gwxhx0w,t1_gwxfk01

3105,1620142099.0,,RobinHood,,,,https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=48617,gwx127l,t1_gwwxsmk
3106,1620164359.0,,RobinHood,,,,This is reported at the end of the year when you do your taxes correct?  Is there a certain threshold where they start to tax you?,gwyafvn,t1_gwxhx0w
3107,1620173733.0,,RobinHood,,,,Short term rates are subject to normal income ranges so if you make less than 10k in total income for the year then you won‚Äôt be taxed.  Long term gains aren‚Äôt taxed if you make less than 40k per year.,gwyulxf,t1_gwyafvn
3108,1620099796.0,n4f7ns,RobinHood,"I apologize if this is a noobish question, but it‚Äôs one that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen an answer to.",Is it possible to have a negative account balance when trading options without exercising a contract?,104.0,,,
3109,1620131632.0,,RobinHood,,,,As long as you aren‚Äôt writing any options (making you the party responsible for taking the loss from an ITM option) then the lowest you should be able to go is 0. Unless you‚Äôre using margin of course.,gwwdxri,t3_n4f7ns
3110,1620129252.0,,RobinHood,,,,"If you are long options with no leverage, no. If you are short options uncovered, or if you use leverage, yes. There are some cases where your broker will liquidate your position automatically if you suffer sufficient losses on short or leveraged positions, in which case you will need to repay any shortfall in the account. 

One example:
You deposit $5,000 into your account, then purchase $8,000 of weekly in the money calls using robinhood gold. The underlying drops 20% during the holding period and the options expire worthless. Robinhood will either have liquidated the position once the value dropped sufficiently, or an hour before expiration on the expiration date. You now owe robinhood $3,000. 

If you are not intimately familiar with the mechanics of options I would strongly suggest not trading them.",gww9xaz,t3_n4f7ns
3111,1620125047.0,,RobinHood,,,,If just buying calls or puts yes you can only lose premium.,gww3xmw,t3_n4f7ns
3112,1620138393.0,,RobinHood,,,,"No. Apart from what it means to exercise an option, the first thing to understand is the ability to exercise a contract is available only for option buyers - not option sellers. When you buy an option you 'own' the rights within the contract. This is not true for option sellers. The selling party has sold the rights within the contract and therefore cannot exercise those rights (since they do not own them).

The second thing to understand is that when you buy options, you cannot lose more than the price of the option itself. In other words, your maximum loss is whatever you paid for the option.

Let's put these ideas together. When you use the language ""without exercising a contract"" by definition you are referring to option buyers. As a buyer, then, the lowest value of your option contracts, at expiration for example, is 0. 

Hope that helps

(It may be illuminating to note that exercising options is not typical for most traders)",gwws1vq,t3_n4f7ns
3113,1620101832.0,,RobinHood,,,,The lowest value it goes is .01,gwvbv75,t3_n4f7ns
3114,1620100542.0,,RobinHood,,,,No worse that could happen is you lose all your premium.,gwv9spk,t3_n4f7ns
3115,1620143682.0,,RobinHood,,,,As long as you're not trading on margin you shouldn't have a negative account. Trading on margin is when you trade with borrowed money. DO NOT DO THAT.  For options the most you can lose is what ever the price of the option was.,gwx4y14,t3_n4f7ns
3116,1620101160.0,,RobinHood,,,,yes,gwvassr,t3_n4f7ns
3117,1620766747.0,,RobinHood,,,,"What if you did have a bank reversal. But immediately fixed it the next trading day, the message went away. My margin is back to zero. Will remove once fixed but my question. I‚Äôm not allowed to buy until someone checks my account? How long does that take?",gxryih3,t3_n4f7ns
3118,1620111479.0,,RobinHood,,,,It can go to 0 at expiration,gwvopyo,t1_gwvbv75
3119,1620133449.0,,RobinHood,,,,That‚Äôs what I was thinking. Thank you!,gwwhbj5,t1_gwvbv75
3120,1620072631.0,n45zqn,RobinHood,So I began investing in January of this year. Buying what I could here and there. I buy typically between 100 and 150 shares a week of the same stock. Will the long term capital gains clock start on my first purchase of the stock back in January? Or will it be a year from each purchase of the same stock?,Trying to figure out capital gains tax for multiple buys of the same stock,8.0,,,
3121,1620077370.0,,RobinHood,,,,"There are separate clocks for each purchase. Long/short term duration is calculated on a per share basis.

Remember that Robinhood is FIFO, so if you sell, the first shares to go are the longest ones you've held.",gwtytk7,t3_n45zqn
3122,1620126257.0,,RobinHood,,,,"The document they send you at the end of the year does all of this for you.

Doesn't it??? Now I'm asking.",gww5ihr,t3_n45zqn
3123,1620075750.0,,RobinHood,,,,U guys pay taxes??? LOL,gwtv5ft,t3_n45zqn
3124,1620077446.0,,RobinHood,,,,It will be a year from each purchase. Also if you sell and buy the same stock within a 60 day window that is considered a wash sale.,gwtyzpp,t3_n45zqn
3125,1620091546.0,,RobinHood,,,, You gotta,gwusq1r,t1_gwtv5ft
3126,1620127720.0,,RobinHood,,,,I was thinking the same thing. Haha,gww7kuz,t1_gwtv5ft
3127,1620104962.0,,RobinHood,,,,I never understand why people like to give advice on something they are not knowledgeable in. Literally the first search on google about wash sale explains the 30 day rule.,gwvgm2o,t1_gwtyzpp
3128,1620079517.0,,RobinHood,,,,Wash sale is sell for a \_loss\_ and buy back within 30 days actually.   You can sell at a profit all you want (and yes the gains are based on how long you held).  The Wash Sale Rule exists to prevent  gaming your realized \_losses\_.,gwu3ky4,t1_gwtyzpp
3129,1620127699.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Well not technically all the time. If my account stays red for the year, there's no taxes to pay. Hahahaha",gww7jpa,t1_gwusq1r
3130,1620061902.0,n41ivh,RobinHood,,Bid-Ask Spread Definition - Investopedia,111.0,,,
3131,1620062993.0,,RobinHood,,,,I think the asking price is the minimum a seller of a stock would accept.. and the Bid is the most a buyer would pay for the said stock... the Bid-Ask spread is the difference between those two numbers.. the smaller the spread is the more liquidity the stock or option has and the larger the spread the less liquidity.. I‚Äôm not a professional advisor. I am just a guy.,gwt19ko,t3_n41ivh
3132,1620065422.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Khan Academy has a very good series on stocks, trading, and financial markets. Lots of good information presented in an easy to understand format.

3133,1620072787.0,,RobinHood,,,,I think a lack of understanding of the bid/ask is one of the most common issues I see when people new to options ask questions. It's hugely important to know how this works and what you're getting into if you are trying to buy/sell options that don't have a lot of volume.,gwtodm5,t3_n41ivh
3134,1620079039.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I‚Äôve noticed this weird phenomena.. let‚Äôs say the option of company ABC is so: CALL strike 23 EXP May 21 bid is .35x211 - open interest 5,905 and the ask is .40x6 of company ABC. If I place a sell at .39 it moves the entire spread from .39 ask and the bid moves up. The price of the option then moves down from .37 to .36 then up to .38 and the spread then changes to .36 bid to .41 ask - what‚Äôs going on here??!",gwu2jyu,t3_n41ivh

But can we üëè PLEASE üëè talk about this crazy spike in my all time chart? Glitch or what????!!!",gwu0a9c,t3_n41ivh
3136,1620085009.0,,RobinHood,,,,"The best way to think of this is to imagine the NYSE 100
Years ago.  You have a room full of buyers and sellers all yelling over each other to either buy at the lowest possible or sell at the highest.  Within this, buyers are trying to outbid each other while sellers are trying to undercut each other, depending on their determination or necessity to sell and buy.  This is where the bid- ask spread comes from.  This is also why the more people participating in the trading of a stock, the closer the bid/ask of that underlying becomes.  Market makers are essentially doing this in real time.  This is also why, although virtually all trading is done on a computer, we still operate by the same market hours we always have.  Without the most people possible participating in the market at the same time, prices can become unclear and you very likely will get ripped off.",gwuf7g5,t3_n41ivh

3138,1620070989.0,,RobinHood,,,,[deleted],gwtk9mn,t1_gwt19ko
3139,1620085282.0,,RobinHood,,,,"While I agree you should understand where the bid ask comes from, it‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt prevent you from trading options.  Start above the mid and work your way down until you get filled.  If your looking to get filled quickly start below the mid.  Whether or not the debit/ credit is worth the option you‚Äôre trading is always subjective to that person",gwufs24,t1_gwtodm5
3140,1620087488.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Need more info. The open interest isn‚Äôt as important as the volume on the day and the number of contracts you are trading. Once your sell order fills, the bid will go to whatever bids are out there. Spreads on options are totally different than stocks. If you‚Äôre trading something that has limited volume, the spread will be wide AF",gwukdjk,t1_gwu2jyu
3141,1620102019.0,,RobinHood,,,,I think some traders use bots or automatic api connection to automatically match the lowest ask. I noticed when I went from $1.80 a contract all the way to $.30 a contract and the same 18 contracts kept following my price change instantly. If I don‚Äôt see them follow I cancel my order and boom the 18 contracts were $.05 above my price,gwvc63d,t1_gwu2jyu
3142,1620102142.0,,RobinHood,,,,Also your example to me is more that the price will always average out between the bid and ask so when the new ask is lower that the last the price will be even lower than that due to averaging out between the bid and the ask,gwvcd9l,t1_gwu2jyu
3143,1620092830.0,,RobinHood,,,,And I have $2.30 in my checking account but transfered $1000 to Robinhood. Is that a problem and why is Robinhood at fault?,gwuvdwc,t1_gwu0a9c
3144,1620072463.0,,RobinHood,,,,Shitty API design. No concept of depth in their crypto data either.,gwtnnm8,t1_gwtk9mn

3149,1620063810.0,,RobinHood,,,," Hello, I have never had a job or needed to pay taxes so I have very little idea of how to do it in general. 

I have bought and sold cryptocurrency in around $100-$150 increments, 12 total transactions counting buying and selling on robinhood and made maybe $5 at most in the past few days. I was just bored sitting on my phone buying and selling as it went up and down a few cents, I did not do enough research and just did not think about it from a tax perspective.

I know it seems petty but I am concerned about what that will do to me tax wise as I assume I will now have to file for the first time and for such a small amount earned. 

Do I only pay taxes on the $5 earned, or will I have to pay some for each of the transactions?",gwt38dk,t3_n3sdik

3158,1620009621.0,n3m2d0,RobinHood,"I'm in my 50s and just found out I have cancer. I started investing for the first time ever in March. Through trial and error, I'm up $1,700 based on an initial investment of $6k. I'll probably have to pay short-term tax because I did some version of day trading...holding onto stocks for a couple of days then selling. This isn't about taxes, though.   


When should I take out profit so that I recoup my initial investment and am only working with profit? I'm in Eth, BTC, QQQ. I'm also in Apple which I'm going to dump in favor of VTI ETh is soaring, but will likely drop. Should I take out the profit from it -  $760 - then start from scratch with it? I'm tempted to liquidate it all and put it in VTI, let it grow safely, then make another lump sum investment. I'm fine, for now.",When do you take out profits?,46.0,,,
3159,1620016558.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I do apologize for the cancer, I hope it can be cured. 

The right time to finish a position and take a profit is subjective. What you shouldn't do is get greedy. Greed has taken many users for their wealth on this sub. Any profit is good profit.

One other note is that you should invest to build wealth not to pay for cancer.
This is purely an example, suppose your treatment costs $1000 and you have all of your capital in one investment. You make a good trade and it increases in value to 900. You wait until it reaches $1000. But then it decreases in value to 700 and never reaches 900 again.

30% sell when you hit your high goal. 
20% to hold on longer if you feel like it will keep going up, or can be sold at the high goal. 

This is assuming that you are solely looking for profits and are not looking to stay in a stock long term. 

Play around with those numbers based on what you feel. 

Before you buy anything, know why you‚Äôre buying it and what your exit strategy is.",gwr1ajf,t3_n3m2d0
3161,1620019886.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I take out at 5% to 200% so really it‚Äôs up to you. I also own Nvidia and it‚Äôs sitting at 300% return, I‚Äôm not selling that for at least 10 years for example.

I just ask myself, do I feel this will continue going up based on x, y and z info and my overall opinion on a company or investment. In a bull market it‚Äôs hard because most the time just leaving it sitting will gain more. However, in the same time doing swing trades 5-15% makes more over a year so those ones are great.

Also, I wish I learned this before but short term tax rate is the same as ordinary income tax based on what you make. I was all afraid to short term trade, fearing a tax bill but it doesn‚Äôt freaking matter. Just pay your dues and move on. I treat it as a job so thus taxed like one. If I got a few million a year in income then I‚Äôll care.",gwr1he7,t3_n3m2d0
3162,1620141811.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Re: Taxes, ideally try to cash out when long-term capital gains tax applies rather than short-term unless it's a tax exempt account. As for an exit strategy, that's really something you need to figure out on your own and then just commit to. It sounds like you want to take out your initial investment, are you comfortable doing that now, or are you hoping to utilize it to make more profit before taking it out? When I make an investment I commit to not needing that money again for a long time. When I take profits I never really take profits, I exit a position at a profit and then roll that into a new investment. Being in your 50s it makes sense that you might be more on the side of things where you're looking to cash out some of the profits and use them. This is really the kind of situation where talking to a CPA is of use and you should consider it, there are even some resources (e.g. local colleges) that can set you up with a free consultation with a CPA.

I would invest in another stock or wait till a dip in same stock and buy and sell it over and over again.

I have been trying to learn about investing, stocks, crypto etc for a few months now by reading and watching YouTube videos. The truth is I'm still pretty overwhelmed and confused by it all. It also doesn't help that I hate numbers lol

Anyway, I decided to ""just do it""  about 3 weeks ago and started with $500 on Robinhood. I have 4 free stocks so far and got 3.11 GE, 0.0298 AMZN, 2 BUZZ, 1 NIO, and 266 DOGE. I definitely don't know what I am doing but I want to invest more. $500 more or maybe 1k. I know that I want VTI or VOO also.

I know and understand that most people on here are not financial advisors and I know that it is up to me to do my own research BUT I am coming to you all anyway to ask for your help/advice. People are a wealth of information on this app. 

So if you were me, a beginner, with $1000 to invest today, what would you do? Thank you all in advance and I welcome any questions you may have.

EDIT: Wow!!! Thank you all for your responses and information. I've learned a lot of new terminology that I hadn't come across previously, so I am going to look into those as well.

For long term conservative holding, most people buy the big index ETFs that mirror the market as a whole, such as an S&P 500 ETF.

3209,1620003608.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Depends on your risk tolerance. I‚Äôm going to assume since you have a substantial savings yet only invested $500 you are either skeptical about stocks or full of shit. I‚Äôll assume the former and we can infer low risk is what you‚Äôre looking for at this time due to small starting position. My suggestion is look into ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äù stocks. These are stocks like coca-cola, Ford, AT&T, and GE. You won‚Äôt see much growth but they have been around forever and can protect your wealth by always being around. If you aren‚Äôt so sure about managing your own stocks, valuations, or intrinsic value I‚Äôd suggest starting with mutual funds or ETF‚Äôs (exchange traded funds). Most mutual funds require a minimum purchase, can only purchase at a set time of day (regardless if it‚Äôs the best value for the stocks involved), they are managed by a person or persons, they invest in multiple stocks at once, and have fees with no guarantee of progress. ETF‚Äôs are traded on the stock market like stock, they invest in multiple stocks chosen by a person or computer algorithm, the time of purchase is the same time as market hours, they have little to no fee, some ETF‚Äôs use leverage which can be dangerous, and generally ETF‚Äôs based on indexes are the safest. ETF‚Äôs based on index‚Äôs like $SPY or $VOO or $QQQ are safe bets. This is since the market established in the late 1800‚Äôs it‚Äôs had growth. $SPY has an average growth rate of 8% since inception. If you are nearing retirement you might want to lower your risk by moving out of stock positions and into bonds. Both of these markets reflect one another. For specific stock recommendations you should speak with a financial advisor considering your experience level and available funds an advisor would help greatly. Lastly a ROTH IRA can help grow your wealth with stocks. Downsides are you can only invest $6k a year and you can‚Äôt take out until your retirement age. The pro‚Äôs will tell you put all of your $1000 into one investment because you wouldn‚Äôt choose a bad stock to invest in and diversified portfolios are for idiots. I will say I‚Äôm not a trading genius so my dumbass has a portfolio diversified over multiple sectors using individual stocks, cryptos, and ETF‚Äôs. Lastly this info mainly applies to U.S. citizens trading on the NYSE.

3210,1620018924.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Remember that investing requires patience, real investing takes years, really decades, that way compound interest can work its magic. You have plenty of time as long as you don't waste 1p years trying to ""get rich quick""  It also requires cool-headedness. When people are panicking you are looking for buying opportunities, when people are riding high on a single stock, you continue to diversify.

Invest in companies you believe in for the long term, hold on for the ride and add when you beliefs are stronger than ever. Look at market Cap to determine a company's size. Individual share price does not matter, especially with fractional shares available now. Market cap = price per share √ó total # of shares.

If you plan to continue adding money to this like a retirement fund then you can buy VOO, VTI, SPY, etc, but if this $1000 is for you to  actively trade, then find some stocks you believe in and get your feet wet. $1000 isn‚Äôt going to get you far gains wise unless you mess with options, and that very well may be what you do if this is fun money and you don‚Äôt care if it disappears.

3220,1620059039.0,,RobinHood,,,,"When I pick a stock, and I‚Äôm not an expert either, I have gotten to the decision based on a tiny bit of randomness and mostly research. I joined a bunch of relevant subreddits and will watch the stocks being talked about - not to necessarily buy, but to be able to start picking. Otherwise it‚Äôs like letter soup right? Easier to have suggestions and go look them all up from there. Also I try to pay attention to things I like - a year ago AMC was struggling and experts thought they might go broke. AMC is what I‚Äôd consider the best chain in the US and I love going to the movies. Even though I‚Äôm high risk and can‚Äôt get to the movies still for a while, they‚Äôre wonderful. I put a little money in there... and over time more and sold some and did it again. I still have like 11 shares I may just never sell at this rate haha. I also love Disney and in spite of them having similar issues, dumped a bit into them too. With excellent results. Anyway my point is you can think about what you normally do or need and where YOU spend money to get inspiration for stocks to check out and possibly buy into. If you‚Äôre not into tech but recognize that it‚Äôs an area with lots of potential, do your research on ETFs or simply go for long term S&P stuff. You‚Äôre likely to trend up if you spread out your money across things that naturally tend to trend up anyway. 

Oh and, if something isn‚Äôt performing well, you will need to recognize when to cut losses and when to wait. If it‚Äôs a long term investment, hold it, but if you had a shorter term in mind and are down a small percent but want to put money into some other thing, taking a small loss for (hopefully) a decent gain is actually smart. You want your money to work for you.",gwsrwae,t3_n3c5ze
3221,1620060127.0,,RobinHood,,,,"VOO. You get 80% of the U.S. economy, crazy low fees. If VOO goes down, Congress jumps into action to get it back up. It's not like Tesla or any individual company which could go bankrupt and no one would miss it.

Also keep $5 free to do reverse split arbitrage. Sometimes a company will announce that 10 shares will now be consolidated into 1 share, which has the effect of increasing the price per share about 10x. (The exact ratio may differ.) So if you had 10 shares before the split, you'd now have 1 share that's worth ten times as much. That's a reverse split.

If you only had 1 share going in, you'd have 1/10 of a share after, a fraction which historically could not be traded. To get around fractional shares, companies will sometimes pay you the cash value of the fractional share. Other times, though, they will round you up to one full share. When they round up, the share you had bought for $0.50 is now worth around $5. You profit $4.50 with almost no risk.

I post these on Twitter (google it), just follow and turn on notifications. It's a super low risk way to make an extra $10 or $20 a month and get your feet wet trading.",gwsugc3,t3_n3c5ze

This effects what kind of strategies you will want to employ. You also need to determine how much risk you are willing to take. 

Do some reading on different strategies; pick one that sounds like it will fit. Which one doesn't really matter.

3262,1619976262.0,n3b99t,RobinHood,"I am setting up a spread for EBAY on Robinhood. EBay just had their quarterly report on 4/29 and their stock dropped by $7.00 to $55.99. I am anticipating it will rise to $56 or higher by 5/21 and opted to go with the following PUT CREDIT spread as follows: 

EBAY
currently $55.99
sell - 14th May - $56.00 - Put 1x100 -$1.16 - $116.00
buy -14th May - $53.00 - Put 1x100 - $0.26 - $-26.00
Total	$90.00 credit

My profit matrix looks like this (link to Options Profit Calculator):
http://opcalc.com/u6D

$90 is my maximum profit for this option trade which is fine for me.

Can I get some feedback if this is the best spread option to apply? (as opposed to a CALL CREDIT spread, iron condor or any other option programs). Are these the optimal expiration dates and strike values to maximize my profit with as little risk as possible?

Brand new Robinhood user here so please be kind!",Need feedback on Put Credit Spread,25.0,,,
3263,1619982930.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Everyone has their own strategy and yours is fine. Here's how I look at it. 

With bull puts I don't think much about the stock going higher. I look for ones that I don't think will go lower. So imo Ebay is a good pick. 

Also, because I'm not looking for it to go up, I sell weeklies. Less time for it to go bad, faster time decay.

Then I focus on the break-even point I want. I look at the second lowest resistance level and see if I can find a risk/profit balance around that. With Ebay first resistance is around 55.30, second is about 54.88.

When it comes to picking strikes, I like both to be out-of-the-money with a few strikes between them. The larger spread gives you a lower profit %, but it makes the profit/loss slope longer, giving you more time to decide when to bail if it starts going bad. 

So for Ebay, I would be inclined to pick something like May 7th 55.50/51.50. With the chart I'm looking at that would be max gain 0.53, max loss 3.47. Break even at 54.97. But the profit of 15.27% is a bit low for me so I probably wouldn't do it. 

If I base it off your expected break-even of 55.10, then I would probably pick May 7 55.5/54. BE @ 55.12, 33.93% profit, max profit 0.35, max loss 1.12, probability of profit 60%. Then I'd sell 14 pairs for a credit of 490.

Again this is my current personal way of picking bull credit spreads. It's quite conservative and short-term. In this case Ebay doesn't quite fit my criteria, but it's close and maybe going out two more weeks would make it look better, but I thought it would be helpful to walk through my thought process. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how to pick your spreads with more confidence. 

Final thoughts - see what the sentiment is Monday and if it looks like it hit resistance. Also take a look at more expensive tickers so you don't have to sell as many to get a decent return amount.",gwp7424,t3_n3b99t

You can reinvest with instant funds, but selling again before those funds have settled is a no-no. This isn't a brokeage's rule, it's based on the Federal Reserve Board's regulation T.

If you don't have margin and you buy stocks with the unsettled proceeds of another sale, you'll get a freeriding violation (and usually have your account locked) if you sell them again before the funds from the prior sale have settled.",gwgj155,t3_n1vszr

Being that it takes if I‚Äôm not mistaken 72 hours for the funds to settle, by setting a certain amount of money to spend each day, you allow yourself the ability to continuously buy and sell every day of the week without running into any violations. For example if you had $900 that you were going to invest, you could use $300 on Monday, then $300 on Tuesday, and then $300 on Wednesday. By doing this in theory you should be able buy and sell on each one of those days, and by doing so you‚Äôll allow yourself to have funds available while you‚Äôre waiting for the proceeds from your initial sale on Monday to settle.

Freeriding and good faith violations are very similar and both preventable in the same way -- by not selling stock bought with unsettled funds.   I didn't want to complicate my answer with this additional detail, but I should have added it to the ""things to look up"".   

From wikipedia:

""The main difference between a [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) violation and free riding is the eventual deposit of funds to cover the buy. In free riding the buyer sells the security without ever depositing the funds to pay for the initial purchase.

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) considers a good faith violation an ""abuse of credit"" and requires the broker keep track of them. If the trader gets three violations in one year, the broker is required to restrict the account. This is compared to the free riding violation which results in an automatic restriction.",gwjlpnb,t1_gwgj155

Boo no fair‚Äù. However, for the poorer investors like myself we struggle with not being greedy and wanting 15% or more. And we miss the the top and it drops quicker than we think it will and oh snap I‚Äôm DOWN 10% bail! Then a few minutes later it‚Äôs going back up and we jump back in to try to ride it again, but wait it was false. Down another 10%. The ticker is still up 10% on the day, which is good for anyone who was in before the day. But you‚Äôre down 20%. Dodge is a great example. I like dodge and do believe it is just getting started. However; on your next day off, take X amount of money you feel like flushing down the toilet, and try to make 40% on the day just jumping in and out in and out.

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

Not sure what‚Äôs worse, me missing out on that extra $70 in easy money, or watching whoever bought the options miss out on $30 of it (and counting) by sleeping on rise as the stock continues to slide. 

With my luck they‚Äôll fail to execute the option at all and it‚Äôll slide back below $4.5.

3527,1619679124.0,n0ypiz,RobinHood,"I am fine creating stop loss/limit orders on stocks and one-leg options but get confused setting stop loss/limit orders on credit and debit spreads on RH. I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

A nice safe stock will get you a 10% rate of return to get you to $100K in 46 years. I'm assuming you have a much faster target time frame. That means higher return and that means much higher risk.


So I'll assume you're looking for at least a 20X if not 50X or 100X return in 1-2 years. This is way beyond investment category and even way beyond speculative category, well in to (calculated) gamble territory. It's about 1 step away from taking $1000 to Vegas, or just buying $1000 in scratch-offs. Just so you know the risks. It certainly is NOT an investment, and you should never use that word in describing what you want to do. It's a pure gamble, YOLO bet it all and let it ride type move. You'll never get there by buying/selling a little bit along the way trying to work up to $100K starting with $1000 in a few years. Because if you could, you'd be retired from professional trading by now, and would own your own hedge fund. 


You only have $1,000 and are not a professional trader so you have to bet big and let it ride.  Dogecoin was less than a penny on Jan 1, 2021. Dogecoin, on average in April, had a price in pennies according to the day of April. Roughly speaking it was 5 cents on the 5th, was 20 cents on the 20th, was 30 cents today.  A 30X return since Jan 1, 2021.  It's probably exactly the gamble you're looking for. Big risk, big reward. Put in a buy limit order for $1000 worth of doge at 30 cents and you can hold it until it hits $10 and buy your $100,000+ race car.  Edit: Broke up the wall of text",gwgfjsr,t3_n0raqu

3567,1619638866.0,n0mz1n,RobinHood,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part‚Äî Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won‚Äôt. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I‚Äôm tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren‚Äôt required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone‚Äôs advice works and I get my money back, I‚Äôd be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that‚Äôs legal. 

tl:dr I believe Robinhood violated my rights when it sold my crypto after the order officially cancelled and restored to my account, and do not know how to proceed",Securities Sold without Permission,21.0,,,

And lastly, when you buy crypto on Robinhood, you don‚Äôt actually own the coins, you own a fraction of a pool of coins in a larger wallet. I hate to say this, but I think you have to take the L and learn the lesson: if you want control over your securities/crypto, you need to own it, and Robinhood isn‚Äôt the place to own either because neither ever become yours when you trade on their platform.

3596,1619636055.0,,RobinHood,,,,"You clearly lack education in regards to business management, finance, and macro economics. 

Business owners regularly forego taking any form of compensation in the interest of the business they operate. As the holder of a non-dividend stock you are effectively that type of owner. Contingencies on holding that share are the board or whoever is tasked with handling the business finance get to make that decision for you. 

If all stocks paid divdends it would normalize share prices, PEs would converge, and prospecting/speculating would be at least inhibited if not impossible. This would likely hinder innovation and stagnate the financial markets. 

If you think there is only value in receiving a dividend, only invest in companies with a stable dividend. 

It is entirely rational, and even ethical, for the end goal of a corporation to not be dividend distribution. In fact, paying a dividend is a strategy to retain shareholders when innovation and growth have stagnated but the company is cash positive. Basically you have all this cash and nothing left to justifiably (or unjustifiably) spend it on; wages are competitive or even industry leading (or at least employee retention is good) so you distribute it to the shareholders. 

Shareholders get paid last almost always. Companies which are not cash positive but continue to pay a dividend have decided to ski a slippery slope that ends in bankruptcy.",gw7dxqe,t3_n0jx5i
3597,1619648868.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I agree with a lot of what is said here but let me go a bit more in-depth:

You start a business with some savings you have. You are going from nothing to HOPEFULLY something, but at the beginning you are (hopefully) pumping all of your money back into the company and not taking pay (because you have to innovate, advertise, scale, build inventory, etc.). 

At some point you become somewhat successful but you still aren‚Äôt taking any pay, and the company still isn‚Äôt turning a profit. You really need investors to help you scale faster and faster and hit critical mass to where you are cash flow positive. You find a VC that loves your company and they give you $$$ for, say, 20% of the company. 

So the VC works with you and you scale and become cash flow positive and now you can afford to pay yourself a small salary but the VC still doesn‚Äôt take any money out. At some point you and the VC want to go public to allow investors to buy shares and for you to cash out some from your hard work. You go public, your company trades on the market, and you are happy. 

Nothing has changed. Instead of you and the VC being the only owners, you now have millions of owners. The company is still growing however. Now that you are public ally traded your have a fiduciary duty to manage the firm to the best benefit of your shareholders. As a growth company you are growing 20% YOY, which clearly means the best use of your money is reinvesting in the company to keep growing and making your shares more valuable, thereby returning value to your shareholders. 

At some point you become SO SUCCESSFUL that you are just a cash generating MACHINE. You literally can‚Äôt find investments for the cash your company has. (Think of Apple here...which is almost exactly what happened with Apple). At the point where you and your management team can‚Äôt create a reasonable return by reinvesting the money into the company (R&D, M&A, etc) then you can return capital to shareholders and allow them to reallocate that money to other profitable investments themselves. 


That is the pretty standard startup -> growth -> value transition process.

You can sell the option whenever for the current market price, which is a function of the stock price, the time to expiration, and the stock's volatility. At expiration, the value is the difference between the stock's market price and the call's strike price.

Buying calls lets you transfer risk of the stock going down to whoever sold the call, while keeping the benefit of the stock going up. In return, the seller charges a premium depending on how likely they are to lose money.",gw9ygzz,t1_gw7rtih

3667,1619619612.0,n0fv4o,RobinHood,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

This was for all users in our department, it gave use the ability to see everything about the banking customers: Name, address, SS, balances, transactions, other authorized users, etc. 

Everything we did was tracked and such, but since we were all using the same username there was no way to know which one of us in the department was responsible for which tasks. Lucky for the bank, none of us in our department ever thought to use the info with bad intentions. The most I ever abused the system was to look up a long-lost friend of my mother‚Äôs to get her address.

So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

1. It is not interest free, you are paying $5 per mo for Gold to get access.  Equivalent to 6% interest on $1000, if my math is correct.
2. If you use the margin, make sure you understand how margin works in relation to your account.  You are correct in stating that if you make a deposit, it will go on the margin balance.  If you have $1000 margin used, and deposit $500, the account will show $500 margin used.",gw1m7u1,t3_mzmmp9

You have 2k buying power and only spend 1200 your using 200 margin if your margin maintenance (minimal account value)needed to avoid them asking for their money back. If buy 1,200 and your margin maintenance is 900 and your account drops below 900 to 750 they can take their money back (margin call) so they would sale enough stocks to equal 200 which would leave you with 550.

But the first 1,000 isnt really free because you have to have robinhood gold at 60/year to get that 1k of margin so if that's the only reason you are getting robinhood gold and only using 1000 then you are effectively paying 6% interest on it.",gw3bdz8,t3_mzmmp9

So for me my returns are out pacing my margin by enough to make it worth while. That can also be written off as a cost to off set capital gains. But I must warn you, please have the money to back up the margin. If you get a margin call you usually only have a day, or less to transfer funds to cover it, or you have to sell something. If you do not, they will start liquating your portfolio until the call is met. Hope that helps.",gw3vqld,t3_mzmmp9
3759,1619564090.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Oh, you can pay it back by just depositing funds at anytime. If you say buy $500 on margin, and you deposit $500, then you covered the call. Each trading platform is different, so make sure it goes to margin, and not to available cash. On TD Ameritrade say I have $100,000 cash on deposit, my margin account with them would be $100,000, so $200,000 in buying power, if I owned $150,000 in stock, I'd have a $50,000 margin balance. If I deposit an extra $50,000 cash it would bring my margin to zero, and also raise my margin availability to $150,000.

3761,1619557890.0,,RobinHood,,,,"If the stock does not pay dividends then you have to pay it back in full. 

My strategy for using margin is based upon dividends and future value of a stock. I started to use margin in about 2007 to gain wealth. Bought and shopped  great top stocks, mutual funds, REIT that would pay me a dividend monthly. Even though stocks pay quartly, common stocks will pay for the margin for example: Jan. April, July, Oct as another stock may pay Feb. May. Aug. Nov. As another March, June, Sept. Dec...so  instead of reinvesting those dividends use the dividends to pay part of your margin. Yet plan to sell part of your shares when the value of the stocks reaches peak in some future years.

So you use 1000 in margin, add 800, once it clears the next day likely, maybe 2-3, your margin will then show 200. 

And even if you have the money elsewhere, say everything is cut in half tomorrow at open, it‚Äôs not going to give you time to pay. Once you hit your margin maintenance level, it‚Äôs going to start selling stocks till you‚Äôre below it, likely the higher requirement, riskier assets first.",gw2wabd,t3_mzmmp9

3773,1619541422.0,,RobinHood,,,,"To add to this great advice, you don‚Äôt wanna invest anyone‚Äôs money but your own, especially if you‚Äôre on the newer side. Between tax liabilities and potential losses, you don‚Äôt wanna owe anyone else, especially if you don‚Äôt have much to invest in the first place

Some of the big CryptoTwitter influencers will flex their margin skills, but they have all explained that they started with money they were willing to lose, and many of them got liquidated (100% loss to pay back the margin debt) or lost 90% or so very early on, before they got to their current positions.

If this is money you can‚Äôt afford to lose, then you shouldn‚Äôt be investing it in things as risky as crypto or, some would even say not to put it in stocks. But if this is money you‚Äôre prepared to lose, then that‚Äôs a tougher decision you have to make, whether you‚Äôre truly prepared to lose it or something less",gw2g9n6,t1_gw23ton
3774,1619556587.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Uh no, it‚Äôs not like the casino, you‚Äôre not playing stocks against Robinhood. Margin at any significant level definitely have interest. It‚Äôs similar to taking a loan from you bank but it‚Äôs less risky for the lender because they have your stocks as collateral. Using margin has its risk but can be pretty effective. The odds are pretty good if you just look at the last 10 years. Margin can also give you cash flow during dips to buy more shares if you don‚Äôt want to sell other positions.",gw3g7wy,t1_gw23ton

Too many people follow traditional old school investing tropes which basically were written in the same book that you should be 50/50 stock bonds.

I am just planning on using margin to accelerate my ETF purchases. Since these aren't very voilatle. I figured I wouldn't really have to worry about the margin being called if I didn't leverage to much.

Yet, that part about transferring money and it not clearing in time scares me. I use RH and get instant access, but it sounds like from your reply it has to actual clear.

Will this clear up the $500 margin and give me $500 cash? 

Or is the only way to close out a margin is to sell said ETF shares purchased on margin?

I'm not stupid and going to be buying growth stocks or crypto with margin.

I just want a little extra leverage in-between cash deposits. If it's there, I have a good chance coming out ahead by years end with this strategy with minimal risk.

3870,1619538132.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I think you get it now based on the comments. In case you don't:

Imagine you go to the store and you write a check to pay for groceries. And then you forget and buy a PS5 and then have no money in your bank account. The grocery store just got screwed over by you when the check bounces right - you just stole groceries. The grocery store may now say ""hey from now on if you write a check you have to guarantee there's enough to pay for it"". This is what's happening with Robinhood, and all brokers.

Let's use the broker now. If you have $500 with them, let's say Robinhood, and you want to buy a stock for $200 and another stock for $150. When you place the order for the first stock worth $200 let's assume no one else is selling, so there's an open order you've placed for $200 for 1 stock. When you go to place the order for the second stock, your available balance you can use will be $300 (the 500 minus the 200 for the open order). Why? Well if you say place an order for 3 of the $150 stock AND it goes through, that's like you buying the PS5. You'll have spent $450 and only have $50 left, now that first order for $200 you can't actually afford it, Robinhood doesn't want to be the grocery store (no brokers do). Now if someone else now accepts your order for the first stock worth $200 who pays for it? You certainly can't you only have $50 left. To avoid this, while you have the open order for the first stock worth $200, if you try to place another order your available balance will be $300 to make sure you can pay for the first set of groceries. So no, Robinhood didn't ""take"" your money. Your money's locked away for the order until either the order goes through or you cancel it.",gw28fuf,t3_mz5fmw

So let‚Äôs say you place your limit at .25 USD per Dogecoin... and you pay Robinhood $1,000.00 for this limit order...
If Dogecoin is currently priced at .269 USD per Dogecoin, you aren‚Äôt going to see the $1,000.00 in your buying power because you cannot use it. It is essentially queued up waiting for 1 Dogecoin to fall to .25 USD and if it does and there are available sellers, THEN your $1,000.00 is spent on the Dogecoin and you will see it reflected on your account.

You can cancel a limit order at any time before your limit set is reached... *and* it will automatically be cancelled after a certain amount of time anyway if the price never drops to your set limit.

But keep in mind, if the price **does** drop to .25 USD per Dogecoin... your money will be spent if sellers are available (and there will be most likely lol) and then your money is invested and there‚Äôs no going back. Then you are playing the Doge game! Lmfao. Until you decide to sell of course. In that case you will get back whatever returns you have on the Dogecoin, be it negative or positive... **and** this is assuming someone wants to buy your Dogecoin.

The money wasn‚Äôt available and the doge wasn‚Äôt in your account because the order you placed could NOT be filled. Meaning that even though you were willing to buy 656 at about $0.15 a coin, nobody was willing to sell at that low of a price. Therefor, the order is not filled.

To put it plainly, I can‚Äôt walk into a Microsoft store and buy an Xbox for $50, because they aren‚Äôt going to sell the Xbox for that low of a price. Same process behind stocks & crypto.

**-Why ETF's-**

The truth is, 89% of fund managers fail to beat the market.

According to this report, 88.99% of large-cap US funds have underperformed the S&P500 index over ten years. Knowing this, why do we as individual investors still try to beat the market as opposed to ETF investing? Overconfidence perhaps? Not sure. My main investment is SPY leaps but besides that I have one other secret ETF that has made me very rich...

**-Why investing in a water(liquid gold) ETF could make you rich!-**

I've spent hours upon hours scouring the web for an ETF that I feel could reliably beat the S&P 500 consistently and I think I've found one(two actually). PHO and FIW, two etf's focused on water conservation and infrastructure.

About 70% of the earth's surface is covered in water, but 97% of it is saltwater, which is unfit for human use. Saltwater cannot be used for drinking, crop irrigation, or most industrial uses. Of the remaining 3% of the world's water resources, only about 1% is readily available for human consumption. This creates a demand for desalination infrastructure to solve the global water crisis as the population of the world rapidly rises by the day.

I was watching a TED talk that said in the future, wars will be waged over water. It simply isn't easy to transport and some areas have a lot more than others. For example, everything from steel to potato chips to computers uses water in the production. Did you know that we use 2400 liters of water to produce just one hamburger?

In fact, water futures were created last December because of the growing interest in water investing. If you look at the 13F filings on Whalewisdom you can see that water is also one of the fastest growing sectors among hedge funds.

**-The Big Short-**

I don't know if you guys remember, but Michael Burry said at the end of The Big Short that he is focused only on investing into water. The more due diligence I do on water(Ted talks, books, articles) the more I realize just how right Michael Burry is about this. Michael Burry is also investing in Farmland, along with Bill Gates who is now the world's biggest farmland owner. In addition, water will benefit from the imminent rising inflation due to the fed's QE. After all, it's an essential commodity.

**-Can't be replaced-**

Unlike tech companies which may go out of favor, water will always be essential and relevant to our lives. As the population of the world increases, tendies will flow into our pockets. I almost see this as a no-lose scenerio. Desalination is a necessity, there's no other way around it. The population growth creates the demand, and a growing population is easier to rely on than trying to anticipate consumer demand for something like Apple!

**-Very cheap leaps-**

As of now, you can get $5200 worth of leaps options on PHO for $200-300. Considering this has been rapidly outperforming the SPY, this is a tremendous bargain! FIW is actually better than PHO when you consider performance, however the options are less liquid. I would recommend FIW if you can find a decent price, otherwise PHO should suit you fine.

**-Conclusion-**

I'd advise everyone to do their own research. There's some fancy graphs and TED talk videos on Youtube. Blackrock and other top ETF's know about water and are highly invested. This ETF is one

of the secrets to my success for the last few years(the other being poor man's covered call on certain stable/fed-backed ETF's under low volatility). Other commodity/real estate etf's are also worth looking into(DBA, WOOD, DBC, REIT's) as an inflation hedge and for diversification.

But most held for a lot longer.

For me I don't want it to become a job or stress me out. I want to learn and I want it to be fun. I jumped into Bitcoin and held for a long time and cashed out with a tidy profit to do something else. My husband has his own money and we have much different styles. But I jumped into dogecoin with my brother as a sibling type rivalry thing and it gave us something in common and something to rib each other about. He bowed out. I sold enough to cover taxes and my cost and I'm up $1,800. Even if I lose the rest, I really didn't lose. I'll sell a bit more if it goes to $0.50 and let the rest ride. Sister is coming out on top!

 I still have single shares of some stocks because I was too poor to buy more and it feels good to see 1 share of NVIDIA purchased @ $89...  it's like looking back at your kindergarden photos, I also have 21 shares of NVAX @ $4.47, 14 shares of SQ @$15... wish I had bought more but it is what it is.

4030,1619464671.0,,RobinHood,,,,"I think you want to find a source of stock insight that isn't itself a platform for stocks because that information is too derivative. Then you want to get these stocks before they move substantially.

With meme stocks it pays to buy them before the craze. I bought dogecoin at .069420 because I thought it was funny and because it had been stagnant for a while.

As another example, I bought Amazon after they announced they're acquiring Whole Foods because their stock remained stagnant at just under $1000 for weeks after the news and I had a feeling that the newly added value would be recognized eventually.

As a third example I bought some weed stocks recently such as YOLO. They're down about 33% - I bought at 30, it's at 20 - but I have a good feeling that they'll come back up in the long run.

Anyway I'd personally use a source of information other than trading platforms for my larger bets, because the fact that a security is being highlighted usually means the market is already in the midst of an adjustment that you missed out on.",gvyqan9,t1_gvyov9i

Taxable income determines whether your long term gains is taxed at 0% or 15%. Fed taxes is zero for the first 40k of long term capital gains. 

I didn't make any money from a job last year. So, my taxable income = 0 + 0 +  long term capital gains of 40k.

Let's use an example of someone with 35K salary, 2k stock short term gains and 10k long term gains

The salary and stock short term gains will be taxed like normal income. This amounts to 37k. Now you have space for $3k worth of long term capital gains left. 

The first 3k will be taxed at 0%, while the next 7k will be taxed at 15%.

In other words, there's actually an incentive in the Fed Taxation rule for you to avoid realizing short term gains or have a regular job.

A jobless retiree with a massive portfolio of stocks can just slowly sell off 40K of stocks every year for your living expense with zero fed tax, and zero state tax (assuming you live in a tax free state). Also, this 40k number keeps increasing by a few hundred dollars too. Use that free money and live in a 3rd world country where expenses are 1/10 of the US.

4223,1619660359.0,,RobinHood,,,,"""Why can't you use SMS?""

It's shocking how many people are under the impression that SMS is secure.  It's not; not in any way, shape or form.

If you use SMS/texts, then essentially everyone on the entire SS7 network can see your messages.  It's like sending unsecured packets over the internet, it's just a stupid thing to do.  NO ONE should be using SMS for security purposes!

There is an argument that it's better than nothing, but even that is questionable because being lulled into a false sense of security might very well be worse, because then you let your guard down \*thinking\* you're secure when you're not.  

Are you better off or worse off having a screen door if a burglar comes to your home?  If you don't have a screen door, you're far more likely to have your front door closed and locked.  If you have a screen door then you may very well lock the screen door, but because it's not really secure, it's not protecting you.

2FA is a great idea.  2FA over SMS is a \*terrible\* idea.  The only reason it's being used is because nearly everyone has a phone number that can receive texts and they know how to find them.  It's laziness on the part of banks and financial organizations.",gw8vfza,t3_mx2fvy

The vegan trend began gaining traction in the 80's and was popularized by certain art and music scenes. Eventually it gained even more traction and is now becoming mainstream.

Most young people are concerned about their environmental footprint and health, and you will see more and more abstaining from meat and dairy, or at the very least, reducing their consumption considerably.  

Long term, Oatly gas it on lock.  Their Barista edition is always selling out at most supermarkets around me.  Supply isn't matching the demand currently. At least not in my area.  That says quite a bit.

I'm all in on the plant based movement. But I'm also a dumb vegan that feels he's on the right side of history, so there's that.

Warby is interesting but consumer brands are just poor investments IMO. Advertising costs eat into profits as competition chews away market share. It‚Äôs a disruptable industry given luxoticas position and Warbys growth.

You‚Äôve sold a put @8 and recd @0.26. This means you‚Äôre bullish on the price and saying that price will be 8 or above.
Selling a put limits your upside so your max profit will be the selling price I.e. 0.26$
And your max loss will be -(8-0)+0.26 = -7.74$

You can calculate your net payoff on expiration date as -(8-X)+.26 where X is price at expiration

You have 2 options -
1. Play it out till the expiration date
2. buying cover (netting off) your put option now (given the numbers above you‚Äôll make a loss of .38-.26 =-0.12

Selling Puts is nothing wrong that you collect money upfront, and hope your option expire worthless so you can keep the money collected only if the stock price goes above your strike price. Here‚Äôs my advice just for your reference: 

1. Wait the day before or on the day your option expires, if still losing money, Roll your option to the later week or weeks, so you hope the stock price will go back up above your strike price. To roll option, Simply click Roll Option button on your trading platform. I made a mistake before by not knowing that function, simply clicked buy back, but never sell again which costed me tons of money. 

2. Close your option once the stock price bounce back and above your cost. or based on your own judgement of the stock direction, set your profit target, either keep part of premium to close the put by buying back, or wait until the option expire worthless and keep full premium you collected. The only risk is you never know if the stock goes to the direction you wanted or not. 

Go to Youtube search option trading to educate yourself, there are tons of videos.

My theory is that stock prices have been recovering so quickly that the stock prices have gone above the actual value of the stocks.

I'm not someone who looks at charts, but I'm a W.B. walking into a shop and asking which food is the most popular and its brand. Having received the answer, I buy those shares and wait for them to go up. But there is a value that cannot be found neither on charts, nor on financial statements, nor in shops: human value and potential.

I am not referring to the CEO or the CFO but to the people who make the company at the lower levels. I am referring to their behaviors, their attachment to work and the brand. What company is it that its employees are afraid of saying they are wrong if they are then fired. Better silence and go as it goes. There is a story that I invite you to read, and make yours for the future, a true story that can make you unique Redditors: The Story of a lost USB key from a leading company and of a person who found it. I'm not telling you more because you have to find this story on the internet. Then if you can't find it, ask me where to find it and I'll see if you can let you know.

Let's say I made 10k on an asset, and then I sell. I've got  +10k.  


Let's say then I reinvest that 10k into the same asset, it goes up another 2k. Then I sell it again for profit of 12k.

5032,1618846078.0,,RobinHood,,,,You‚Äôre not going to get taxed for $22k of profit if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. You‚Äôll be taxed for the first $10k you sold for and then for the $2k of profit you got on the second.,gv3ahi2,t3_mu1834
5033,1618849499.0,,RobinHood,,,,You would get taxed on the first 10 and the additional 2k. But your rate will greatly depend on how long you held the asset for. If it's less than a year than you will get taxed at a regular rate but if it's over a year you get some real tax breaks.,gv3imdb,t3_mu1834
5034,1618841793.0,,RobinHood,,,,"$10k on the first and $2k on the second trade. You'd go broke in no time if your tax burden compounded.

Especially with all the recent hype around investing and all this money younger people are making from like doge coin. 

It‚Äôs good you‚Äôre asking this now because I think a lot of people could be in for a reality check when tax season comes. I wish all the investing subs - stock or crypto - should pin or include tax info in their sidebars.",gv3p6n3,t3_mu1834

You go back to the market this time as a seller, you make a transaction,sell some produce, and you pay tax on it. 

You sell/make another transaction, pay tax on that, so on and on. 

If you don‚Äôt sell some produces and keep them, no tax needs to be paid as they are yours and they could continue to grow/or store. (terrible analogy now).

Edit- 
keep in mind, 1 year or less of holding any GAINS and sell = higher tax, 1 year or more of holding any GAINS before selling = less tax.

There‚Äôs also accounts to hold and transact or hold your positions for long term and pay less or no tax on under certain circumstances and guidelines. It entirely depends on your strategy, and what your intentions are for you gains.",gv3up8j,t3_mu1834

5040,1618867107.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Wash sales aside, the taxman doesn‚Äôt really care how many or the exact nature of the trades it took you to make a profit.

Think about it this way:

Let‚Äôs say you started the year with $50K.  You bought some asset and then sold it at $60K.  Sweet, you just made a $10K profit, as per your example.

You invest more money and then make another $2K.  So now you have a total of $62K cash.

The taxman says, you had $50K and now you have $62K.  That‚Äôs $12K profit.  We‚Äôll take the tax on that, thank you very much.

Now, one exception to this rule might be if you straddle tax years.  For example, let‚Äôs suppose that you bought the initial $50K asset in March 2019, sold for $60K in April. Then you purchased $10K in December 2019 and sold for $12K in January 2020.

Depending on your individual tax situation, it‚Äôs possible that the $10K profit would be counted in the 2019 tax year and the additional $2K would be counted in 2020.  That‚Äôs to say, you‚Äôd still taxed on the full amount ($12K) but depending on the timing of your trades, it could be divided across two years.",gv4nrqy,t3_mu1834
5041,1618856848.0,,RobinHood,,,,"Part of the tax code differentiates between Longterm and short term capital gains. Longterm capital gains (held for at least 1 year) have their own tax brackets (which are set by your income level). Short term capital gains are usually taxed as an addition to your normal income. That being said, when you are only taxed in the gains you make, so in your example the 10k you make initially and then the subsequent 2k would be the tax base. Assuming you have already paid taxes on or are tax exempt from the money you used to invest initially the IRS will never tax you on income you‚Äôve already paid your taxes on (theres a few exceptions). Another thing, if you take a loss on an asset you held for three months, that will lower the short-term capital gains tax base that you have.

You sell it for $50 and pick it back up for $50 the same day (or within 31 days) thinking you can apply the loss against the gain and report $0 gain to the IRS and owe no taxes.  That is not the case.   The sale and repurchase of the stock within 31 days is considered a ‚Äúwash sale‚Äù and that loss is not reportable as a loss to the IRS.  You still owe taxes on the $50.

Not exactly true, but pretty close. All you have to do is sell the replacement shares incurred from the wash transaction before the end of the year, i.e. December 31. The easiest way to do this is to just close out your entire position that you have wash sales in.

Then do not buy back for 30 days after the fact. So if you sold on December 30, do not buy back until January 31. To be safe, I'd wait a few extra days.

This is why you get your tax docs in February. Your broker has to be sure you didn't buy back in during January.",gv76bvo,t1_gv5oiiv

We all know Peloton as the popular home-workout brand. Is the company purely a covid play or were they always destined for success? WallStreet seems to valuate the company as a low-margin hardware company, but should that really be the case? We‚Äôll go through some of the ins and outs of the company‚Äôs metrics, potential risks, catalysts, and a look at the company‚Äôs growth as the world re-opens from lockdowns.

**Covid play or is this the new trend?**

It could be debated that Peloton would not be where they are today without covid and the global lockdowns that occurred. However, were they truly a covid play or did the virus simply speed up the process of them becoming a home-workout powerhouse? The world is re-opening, but demand for their bikes are still at peak. The CEO noted in their latest earnings call (Feb-04-2021) that even with the vaccine roll-out demand for the bike has not decreased.

‚ÄúWe still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. We haven't seen any softening of demand.‚Äù

A look at Google search trends for the term ‚ÄúPeloton‚Äù as well as their traffic estimation from high-end SEO tools would also suggest that demand has remained consistent.

&#x200B;

Peloton has been accurate with their next-quarter guidance and they‚Äôve been beating estimates consistently, but they seem to slightly sand-bag full-year guidance creating ‚Äúeasy beats‚Äù. Let‚Äôs go through a few factors that make Peloton the strong company that they are, and a deep dive into some of the growth they can expect post-covid.

**Brand Loyalty** 

Peloton has succeeded in becoming the go-to name for in-home cycling classes, and as they expand, the in-home workout leader. Their brand-loyalty also rivals some of the best of the best. When looking at the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is a ranking of brand loyalty, Peloton has a score in the high 90‚Äôs which is a greater score than BOTH Apple and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/yyuwhwehvxt61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd6838be56deb1e3f136871b78d6b2b8e0a8edb

This is attributed to the high-quality content the company pushes to end-users through their pre-recorded and live classes. Users always have plenty of options when it comes to taking classes with their favorite instructors. Their NPS score is even more evident with the churn-rate Peloton experiences on memberships. Is the churn-rate really that important? In this industry, yes, and in my opinion this is what will differentiate Peloton as more of a tech valuation instead of ‚Äújust‚Äù a hardware company.

To give you reference of how good Peloton‚Äôs churn rate is, let‚Äôs compare it to Apple TV+ and Netflix. First, the ‚Äúchurn‚Äù is the rate of attrition the company experiences over a time-period. Basically it means how often they are **losing** customers. AppleTV+ has a [20% churn rate](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/), which is quite high, while Netflix has a [churn rate of 3%](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/). So what was Peloton‚Äôs churn rate last quarter? 0.76%, some of the lowest levels in *any* industry. The company has consistently had churn under 1% since the Pandemic began, and they expect churn to remain under 0.80% for the foreseeable future. You must remember that this number affects the *recurring revenue* source for the company, which is critical for them.

**Big revenue growth, almost no profits. What gives?**

While it‚Äôs true that Peloton has been having blow-out quarter after blow-out quarter, they have just barely been profitable. Last quarter (Q2-2021), they did a mere $63.6 million of net income [**on over a billion in revenue**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549). Doesn‚Äôt look great from the outside, but we have to remember that this company has been selling every single bike they‚Äôve ever produced and can barely keep up with the high demand over the last 4 quarters. They‚Äôve invested aggressively into the expansion of their [**supply chain infrastructure**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/) and recently they [**acquired Precor**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor), another fitness chain with strong connections to hotels and gyms, for $420 million. The Precor acquisition will substantially increase domestic manufacturing capabilities for their bike and tread product. Here‚Äôs a look at the current OTD (order-to-delivery) times within the USA, from the Peloton website.

https://preview.redd.it/kwnbtizivxt61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96981504fb19209f11e56ef8bd49795c8d5eaf0

We can see that even after exponentially increasing their production capacity over the last year customers still need to wait weeks or months to receive the product. Peloton has been working hard to get delivery times down to the desired 1-2 weeks. Management noted that with these aggressive supply chain investments they will be able to get there by Q3 or Q4, 2021. Management commented on OTD times in their last earnings call.

‚Äúthe successes that we're seeing in getting the order to delivery down and getting our backlog down are 100% based on incredible upgrades, and our manufacturing capacity up to over six times --¬†6x increase in just the last 12 months in our capacity of them know -- we're now making more Bikes on a monthly basis than we did in all of fiscal 2018‚Äù

Due to covid there‚Äôs been a lot of delays (unloading times 4x longer than a year ago) at the west coast port-of-entry that has forced Peloton to re-schedule many deliveries. Another reason why net profits have been affected to such an extant is that Peloton has already started what they expect to be over 100 million expenditure in expediting shipments using more expensive methods (air freight). From the CC:

‚ÄúThough we're beginning to see the benefits of our extensive supply chain investments, our delivery wait times remain elevated‚Ä¶ we are investing over $100 million in expedited shipping to reduce the wait times for our products.

But what I can say is that we do expect that this $100 million, which we recognize is a very large investment. We believe will get us back to normal shipping protocol by the end of this fiscal year‚Ä¶ the expedited shipping investment brings down OTD. And that gets inventory into warehouses, which is going to allow us to get aggressive with marketing really for the first time‚Äù

**Risks to the downside**

I‚Äôm seeing a few notable risks that might have a negative effect on the company. I‚Äôll go through them here:

**Cheaper Competition:** we have a less ‚Äúpremium‚Äù brand also entering the scene with NordicTrack now providing similar products at a much lower cost.

**Long delivery times:** It‚Äôs only natural that when you go to the checkout page for your brand new Peloton bike and see a delivery time of nearly 2-3 months you might be turned away to a competitor (such as the NordicTrack, ProForm, or SoulCycle bike). However, like we mentioned earlier is that Peloton has extremely high brand loyalty. People want a Peloton, just like they prefer Apple iPhone over Samsung (or vice versa), or Lululemon clothing instead of the off-brand (and much cheaper) at Walmart.

**Re-opening risks:** As the world re-opens the risk of churn becomes higher as well. However, it is my opinion that gym-goers will maintain both their gym membership as well as their Peloton membership. This is not a ‚Äúone or the other‚Äù case. I would not be surprised if Peloton subscriber churn rate stayed under 1% as everything re-opens. A risk to the company none-the-less.

**Low-margin equipment sales:** Back in August 2020, Peloton CEO noted that each bike is sold at nearly break-even, meaning they don‚Äôt make any money on the sale. The true net-profit will be locking the user into the Peloton content ecosystem. He also stated that due to the economies of scale they are creating that eventually (and most likely already), they will be making a profit on each bike sold. He also mentions on the Q1 2021 earnings call that both the original Bike and the Bike+ have extremely similar margins. Peloton doesn‚Äôt disclose the specific mix of their products that attribute to revenues and how many treads were sold vs bikes vs Bike+, but I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that each of their products will have similar margins.

**Freight Pricing Pressure:** This has been quite a challenge for the company. They‚Äôve been maneuvering through logistics issues and have dedicated $100 million to reducing the OTD times to keep new customers happy. Due to covid, this freight pricing pressure might continue for the rest of the year and possibly longer. Management has noted that their forward guidance does already include these inefficiencies, which is obvious because the company‚Äôs growth in 2020 would have been much stronger had it been able to fulfill every single order it had on the books.

**Over-investment into supply chain:** There are also some risks associated with all these supply chain investments the company is making. Right now it seems like a smart play to keep up with the demand of bikes and treads, but at what cost? 420 million Precor acquisition, an extra 100 million investment in expediting shipments, further investments into their Taiwan manufacturing site are all cutting deeply into margins. There is risk that 2-3 years from now they have more supply than demand and the question of the validity of these supply-chain investments may come up. However, in my opinion, Peloton management has been doing a great job at managing the difficulties not only with logistics through covid, but also with the explosive growth the company has seen.

**Potential Catalysts**

**International Expansion**

Until now Peloton has been laser-focused on the U.S market. They‚Äôve been slowly [expanding into Europe and Canada](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-expands-to-europe-and-canada-300644577.html), and have just recently opened up the tread market in United Kingdom. From their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had some positive comments to say about European markets:

‚ÄúU.K. Tread sales have exceeded our expectations, and our early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.‚Äù

The demand for Peloton is highest in the United States at the moment, but that doesn‚Äôt go to say the product can‚Äôt succeed internationally. In my opinion, *when* demand in the U.S starts to decrease it will be off-set by the increase of growth in international markets.

**More on the Precor Acquisition**

Going back a bit more on the Precor acquisition. This was a strategic move by management and will have a two-fold positive effect on the company. The first is that delivery times will finally be shortened with the wide manufacturing footprint that will be created in the U.S. This will also alleviate stress of high shipping costs that the company has incurred. The Precor deal and having a U.S based factory should lead to better performance for Peloton‚Äôs bottom line. Second, Precor has very good relationships with channels that Peloton has not yet penetrated. This will help Peloton gain instant-access to some very lucrative end-markets, which include schools, clubs, hotels, and gyms. When asked about the Precor acquisition on their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had to say:

‚Äúit's been enormous curiosity about what this could mean in terms of delivering a combined Precor Peloton experience in the commercial channel‚Äù

They want to get Peloton into all these channels and the possibilities are endless.

**Economies of Scale**

It‚Äôs evident the company has been bogged down by extensive costs and ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù. They‚Äôve maneuvered through the Pandemic and are meeting extremely high demand by spending a lot more on shipping and getting product from their factory in Taiwan to the warehouse in the United States. They also have large expenditures on creating content, hiring instructors, and maintaining the quality of product. All this to keep users engaged. With the Precor acquisition, these expenses will become a lower percent of the revenue generated as margins are increased and revenue increases.

**Valuation**

There are quite a few topics I want to touch base on in terms of the company‚Äôs valuation. I think if we were to use a benchmark of value, we could look at Nautilus Inc (NLS), which is a fitness equipment manufacturing company, is currently trading at 1x trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenues‚Ä¶ On the other side of things, you have tech stocks trading at incredibly high valuations all because they are bringing in high-margin recurring revenue. So the debate will be low-margin hardware versus high-margin recurring revenue. Peloton fits somewhere in the middle.

WallStreet‚Äôs main concerns for Peloton are going to be over the company‚Äôs margins, and the longevity of the increased ‚Äúcovid‚Äù demand. The big question is, what happens when demand slows? After-all, the market is a forward-looking. I want to look at this in two ways. The first is going to be international expansion off-setting a slow in growth in the United States. The second is going to be a look at the recurring revenues and continued subscriber growth over the next 2-3 years.

**Demand**

As with any product, the demand for Peloton products will eventually plateau. Peloton has done well by releasing the new treadmill product, with rumors of a rowing machine and other in-home fitness equipment. I would not be surprised to see Peloton develop a very robust product line. However, as growth slows in one segment (bikes) a new segment will open up (tread/rower/other products). With 2 million in cash on the balance sheet Peloton is in a great position to expand their brand into other segments both in the domestic USA and internationally.

Peloton‚Äôs expansion internationally is still in the very early stages as they‚Äôve only just began to penetrate these markets. Like I touched up on previously, the increased demand internationally will off-set some of the growth slowing in the United States. The end-goal of the company is to increase margins on their hardware products, while selling a lot of it, and then locking users into their ecosystem with the recurring subscription which will be a big money-maker for them.

**Subscriptions**

The subscription revenues, which currently have a 60% gross profit, are going un-noticed with the company‚Äôs valuation. In their most recent quarter (Q2-2021) they did over 1.064 billion in revenue. From that revenue, approximately 81.7% came from sales of bikes, treads, and other products in their ‚Äúconnected fitness‚Äù segment. The other 18.3% came from subscription revenue. Their ‚Äúconnected fitness‚Äù and ‚Äúsubscription revenue‚Äù segments also come in with gross profits of 35.3%, and 60.3%, respectively.

Their guidance for Q3-2021 had similar performance to last quarter, where they guided another billion in revenue and an additional 300m subscribers to their network. This is also coming off their holiday season quarter, which generally provides an additional boost in sales. In my opinion, I think it would be safe to assume that continued high demand in the U.S market, with growing international exposure will get the company doing $2 billion in revenue per quarter. Remember that 18.3% of that revenue is recurring from their subscription model. This would generate about $366 million in subscription revenue per quarter, and on a twelve-month basis approximately $1.47 billion per year. Here‚Äôs a look at their Q2-2021 revenue and subscriber growth.

https://preview.redd.it/no1s4xkkvxt61.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d9030c404791abd6563d9ef13c605fd7a20279

Peloton currently has a market cap of $32 billion. *If* the company were to achieve $2 billion revenues per quarter in 1-2 years, which in my opinion is quite probable, then at current valuations they would be trading at 4x sales, with 20% of that coming from recurring subscriptions. Don‚Äôt forget they have a strong balance sheet with just over 2 million in cash assets for future investments.

I like the stock and would like to invest in it while it is trading at a market cap below 10-15x revenues. At that same valuation today they would be priced at $180 instead of $110.

**TLDR;**

1. The company has had blowout quarter after blowout quarter, but barely turning a profit. They have been experiencing ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù and invested heavily into their supply chain infrastructure. $420 million Precor acquisition, $100 million in *additional* expedited shipping costs, and digital content production have cut heavily into their margins.
2. They are doing $1 billion revenues per quarter and with steady growth they might get up to $2 billion per quarter in 2022. Approximately 20% of that revenue will be *recurring* revenue from their fitness subscription model. Not only that, but they are also adding 300m new subscribers to their ecosystem each quarter. 
3. With all these supply chain infrastructure upgrades they are still selling every single bike they can produce. Management noted that demand has remained high even with global vaccine roll-outs. They are just getting their feet wet with international markets, which could provide another boost in demand.
4. There are a few concerns about the company moving forward, such as: low margin product, over-investment in new factories and acquisitions, long delivery times turning customers to competitors, and re-opening risks. We‚Äôve addressed these above.
5. If the company can prove they are more than a ‚Äúhardware‚Äù manufacturing company WallStreet will give them the proper valuation. They are currently on track to have over 2m paying members to their integrated fitness model and I would not be surprised if they hit over 3-4 million members by 2022.",Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD),12.0,,,

I just wanted something where I could pick 30ish stocks and continuously buy but not have to go through the act of partially buying a bunch of shares every paycheck.

You‚Äôre also not necessarily getting twice the margin of what you own either. It depends on how much collateral is needed to back certain stocks. Some need to be 100% maintained. 

I‚Äôve been using margin for the past few months, yet I can still buy things like gme despite people believing you can‚Äôt use margin, or transfer margin back to my bank.
