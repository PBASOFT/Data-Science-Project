My general investing mindset, I'll go with the biggest company that provides the sort of returns I want.  Small banks trading with a lower P/E, if they provide better returns than JPM I'm on it.

That is 100% how it does work. Every year the share holders elect the board of directors.  For the most part the board of directors decide this; the board also appoints the C level executives (CEO, CFO, COO, CIO) and those executives hire the rest of the employees. Now its majority rule; if you want all the profits to be paid out in dividends but the rest of the share holders want to use the profits to pay down debt or expand; well majority rule. However if you can convince the rest of the share holders to vote to pay a dividend, well you can now appoint a BOD that will pay a dividend.

However not to go on a long tangent; but honestly the ""general public"" knows nothing about how to run a business.  Some companies where the founder controls over 50% of the voting rights (so they can basically do about anything they want) actually commands a ""premium"" vs companies who are share holder driven. Why? because usually the founder who has poured their heart and soul into the company and has lived and breathed the company for 10-15-20 years knows more about the company/industry and what is best than joe blow investor.

Again not go on a big tangent but look at facebook , Zuckerburg on a whim with one day just bought instagram. In a normal company this would have taken months of negotiation , share holder votes . However because Zuckerburg  controls the majority of the voting share he just did it. And it worked.

To keep going lets talk about netflix vs blockbuster. The common narrative is blockbuster was this dinosaur who failed to adapt and was eaten alive by netflix. The truth is far different. Blockbuster management early on saw the threat of netflix and did develop a plan to adapt. They created a subscription service  that had mail or in store pick up / drop off, and was even developing a streaming service . Also you hear that blockbuster passed up buying neflix for 50 million , at the time netflix was just like 5 warehouses and 200 employees. Blockbuster had 9000 stores and if they wanted to replicate the mail in service they basically could over night and didn't need netflix.

The issue is all of this stuff costed blockbuster a lot of money; the subscription service eliminated late fees what accounted for a big part of the revenue and the streaming service was hugely expensive in the mid 2000's . Now this cut into their profits, but they 100% realized this was necessary for their long term survival. That was until activist investor Carl Icahn bought 20% of the company then convinced other share holders that the management was dumb and needed to be replaced and was spending all this money on streaming an mail when it didn't need to because netflix was a fad. It ""worked"" and Carl Icahn was able to appoint a new BOD who fired the CEO , CFO and replaced them with people of their choice. The new CEO promptly cancelled all development of their streaming / mail service, cancelled their subscription service and implemented all their late fees.

It worked, for a bit; netflix for the next few quarters increased their profits, as they decreased R&D spending (scuttles their streaming service) then brought back late fees and everything customers hated about rental stores. Well the rest is history , and netflix ate them for lunch. 

So leaving the company direction up to Joe shareholder isn't always the best idea",,

The end value is the same so I am not super worried that I've lost money.

Is this just some kind of a UI error?

Is the bug more or less that the program thinks that I was carrying strictly cash at 8AM this morning, when in reality I was actually carrying stocks and a call sell?

I got very intrigued about this company when I saw that Munger was buying BABA specifically for the holdings of DJCO. BUT I could find very little analyst coverage, Yahoo board convos, etc. about it. Weird

It's interesting that it ran up and then came down with other small-caps recently. I can't think of any other development during that time period (BABA came later IIRC?).

I like that it's a deep value play in a sense, but I also don't know if holding companies ever fully realize the value of their underlying. POAHY is an example. Will it ever catch up to VWAGY? 

I'm still holding POAHY. But unsure why lol. Read about the Burry thesis for it and bought. I like obscure stocks and companies. Some really are diamonds in the rough. But in this case, I'm not sure if this is a diamond in the rough so much as forgotten laggard that has no catalyst or plan to revitalize itself if only with good PR. The float is tiny, but so is volume like you said. It could move fast. But the BABA move didn't do much?

If you like this sort of thing, though, you should look at BOMN. It's a mini Berkshire and has ties to Berkshire itself. Has its own SPAC it brought to market and $DFH IIRC.

Key points:

The transaction will result in Redbox becoming a publicly traded company with an enterprise value of $693 million.

&#x200B;

The transaction, approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. At that point, Redbox’s common stock is expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RDBX.” The transaction is being funded by a combination of $145 million of cash held in the trust account of Seaport Global Acquisition and a private investment in public equity (PIPE) commitment of $50 million led by Ophir Asset Management.

&#x200B;

After the deal closes, Redbox expects to have approximately $209 million in cash that will be used to pay down existing debt and fund digital expansion, content acquisition and marketing initiatives.

&#x200B;

According to Redbox, it generated $114 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020.

My personal opinion, this could be an interesting opportunity especially since Redbox just started launching AVOD service like Tubi/Pluto TV.

They are but they have been making switch to digital. They're also doing avod (free shows/movies with ads) like pluto and tubi.

Redbox has few advantages here

They still have DVDs, revenues are not much but still revenues.

They do EST and VOD, 2 services Tubi and Pluto don't offer

Now they're offering AVOD.

Soon, I suspect they'll be doing originals just like any other service.",nice2u,"Redbox to go public later this year via special purp acq company Ticker = ""RDBX"""

You keep repeating this, as if ""building wealth"" is a risk free strategy. As I explained to you the potential returns are higher but the risk is also higher. The average investor who is trying to save for his retirement shouldn't be taking large risks with that money.

293,,2021-05-22 11:41:16,t3_nigsd4,,investing," Nano Dimension Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, provides additive electronics in Israel and internationally. Its flagship product is the proprietary DragonFly lights-out digital manufacturing (LDM) system, a precision system that produces professional multilayer circuit-boards, radio frequency antennas, sensors, conductive geometries, and molded connected devices for prototyping through custom additive manufacturing. The company also provides nanotechnology based conductive and dielectric inks; and DragonFly and Switch software to manage the design file and printing process. It markets and sells products and services to companies that develop products with electronic components, including companies in the defense, automotive, consumer electronics, semiconductor, aerospace, and medical industries, as well as research institutes. (description taken from Yahoo finance)

This is a company that became a YouTube favorite last year together with Bionano genomics. Cathie Wood started buying into them and then they exploded and became super popular. Their price went from the low 1-2$ to over 15$. During this run some interesting things happened. They started doing stock offerings. When the price went up with 50% they did another offering. The price was dropping 20% and then rallying again and then another offering was coming. They did this again and again and again and at some point people just said the company is diluting too much and it’s going to be a flop. And although usually second offerings are bad in this case I think it was brilliant for the company. Their price went way over what it is supposed to be and they took the advantage to hoard cash. So much that now they have 1.47 billion in cash and their entire market cap is 1.58 billion. That means if you would buy all the shares at the current market price you could pocket the cash and have the company for 110 mil and that makes this company to seem really cheap and the risk of the price going down significantly is really low. Even if the entire manufacturing world would stop today you would basically get 93% of your investment back. Their price was away from fundamentals based on hype and the company took advantage of that which I think it’s a smart move. Now the CEO said they will not do any more dilution because they have enough cash for their planned mergers and acquisitions and also for R&D.

Since they hoarded this cash they acquired two companies: one that is expert in printing micro components (super small mechanical parts) and a machine learning company that they plan to use to improve the quality of their prints and make their 3D printers into a network of printers. I think both of these will help them make more complex PCBAs that could have studs and mechanical clips 3D printed and will reduce the time for assembly. At their last investors call they also announced that they will launch a new 3D printer in the summer. Also they are developing next-gen machines for production (expected to come in 1-2 years). And on top of this they are planning to acquire companies, including PCB manufacturers in Europe and/or US. Quick note: The CEO mentioned a few times they will not acquire companies just to acquire, they will buy someone when the price is right and it helps them to develop vertically and improve their printing tech.

Another way they are consuming the money is R&D and marketing. They need to be heard of to be able to sell and they also need to have high tech. From what I understood they are using silver ink for conductive parts which is conductive enough for anything and for dielectric what they are using now can make PCBs but not high tech ones. They mentioned they made some breakthrough in dielectric materials that they can use but it’s not published yet what it is. It seems at least 30% of R&D expense goes in the materials exploration. I personally love this because if they can position as leaders in this field and have the best tech their competitiveness will make them a behemoth in this field.

The company makes money in two distinct way: selling 3D printers for PCBAs for companies or printing PCBAs for companies as a service. Last year, due to corona their sale of 3D printers went down and that’s understandable. For their 3D printing service I think they are having an issue due to the shortage of semiconductors. Right now if you want to make a board you can print it in China and depending on how fast you want it ready it will cost you more. But if you are ok with waiting 4 weeks for your boards then they become really cheap. Due to shortages in components a lot of companies are ok with waiting because it doesn’t make sense to pay a lot to have your board fast if you need to wait either way for components. The trick is if you want to have it 3D printed by Nano Dimension it’s relatively expensive because it’s fast. Until the semiconductor shortage get’s a bit under control I see NNDM suffering in this field. I had a discussion with their sales representative and got an idea on their prices, it’s a bit high comparatively to traditional PCBAs, while the dimension of the PCBAs they can print is relatively small. Also the CEO said they do not plan to be operating cashflow positive in the next 2 years. This is because they want to expand and cash is not a problem (to put it in perspective, they have 1.4 billion in cash and the 2 new companies costed less than 200mil, R&D costs for a quarter were 3.7 mil). It’s clear that the focus is growth and then switching to positive cashflow.

At their last investor call the CEO of NNDM is mentioning that he wants to revolutionize the printing of PCBAs so that you print just what you need. This will be interesting if it’s possible but I personally doubt this will happen in the next 3-4 years because I’ve seen personally how efficient factories are now when it comes to PCBA manufacturing. What I think it will happen (take this with a chunk of salt) is that they will start printing prototypes for a lot of companies and at some point those companies will just acquire 3D printers for a more agile development in their R&D. Also the space industry will probably use them more and more (they already sent some 3D printed boards to the ISS).

Below you can see their price evolution and all the drops on the way up represent a new stock offering. You can also see that they are increasing their revenue year by year (with the exception of 2020 which is a special year). And they reduced the bleeding in cash flow in the last years. That will look worse for the next years but now they have cash to work with.

This is just for information purposes, it is not investment advice, I am not an investing professional. Do your own due diligence before investing in anything and remember: The market can remain irrational more than you can stay solvent.

Have a good week!",nigsd4,Nano Dimension has as much cash as market cap

BTC is a traditional cryptocurrency, but ETH is much more of a cryptocommodity because it offers access to the EVM. Often why you see BTC referred to as 'digital gold' and 'digital oil'.

That's not to say ETH can't surpass BTC in price because the value of what it does is higher, but to say their somehow in competition is naive. We're still so early in the cryptomarket that the entire economy is pegged to BTC, which is obvious right now, but that could change in the future. Regardless of where ETH and BTC end up relative to eachother that's not evidence of either displacing the other, because they're really solving seperate issues. It's kind of like saying Intel will replace Nvidia in the future, it's not that Intel couldn't surpass Nvidia's market cap at some point (they've already played jumprope here before), it's that Intel and Nvidia are not solving the same issues so to say that one replaces the other is absurd. While Nvidia makes CPU's they're only higher-end and used in the scientific computing context where Nvidia shines, and while Intel makes integrated GPU's they haven't been interested in breaking in to the higher-end GPU market, so neither of them are really much in competition in the first place.

In short: ETH can't take over BTC's job because Ether is inflationary, the BTC supply cap is integral to the role of BTC as a cryptocurrency. BTC can't take over ETH's job because BTC doesn't allow for smart contracts (BCH might disagree on this point) or faciliate tokens on top of it's ecosystem, while the EVM is integral to the role of Ethereum as a cryptocommodity. People who understand both of these cryptoassets also know that they have completely different reasons for existing. You can of course make the argument that BTC will become irrelevant in the future regardless because a cryptocurrency with a max supply who's sole role is facilitating it's own transactions isn't what the market will want, but you can't make the argument that ETH will become that, because ETH is solving an entirely different problem.",,

here in the UK there are two main options - and if you're only planning to invest £20,000 you can out it into a tax free ISA. this means it is tax free of capital gains tax and i believe dividends. 

In terms of providers, Trading 212 as a few options like your VUSA (S&P 500 tracker index) and other ""vanilla"" index funds as well as a few REITs and is entirely commission free.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges commission and for maintaining the account, but the offer a wide range of funds - basically everything you can think of. for example i own something called "" AXA Framilington Global Technology Fund"" and a bunch of other things. It's honestly endless. 

Just make surer for hargreaves lansdown you turn of getting posted reports as they charge £20 a year for this! (its becuase they are in many ways a boomer company that lets people trade via phone and text) 

personally, i would choose hargreaves lansdown if your plan is to just buy some index trackers and come back in 10,20 years. it is one of the big boys in the UK and is designed for this. also, unlike trading 212 a) you can transfer your stocks as you actually own then and b) i actually trust them t have my best interests at heart (for example eToro and trading 212 halted $GME but HL didn't)

399,,2021-05-22 14:04:09,t3_nijbla,,investing,Working on an ESG tilted portfolio for a retirement account and am unsure which direction to go. On one hand adding all 7 of the various Nuveen ESG indexes seems it is the most diversified approach however the expense ratios are slightly higher. And then there are some of the iShares that seem slightly less diverse? There is also the new Blackrock managed ETFS LCTU and LCTD. They don’t have a ton of holdings but the expense ratios are even lower than passive Nuveen ETFS. Can those two work as majority holdings in a portfolio? I know ESG standards can be subjective. It seems Blackrock actually puts pressure on companies with their letters every year. But are their funds diversified enough? I am curious to know what other people have used in their portfolios if they are into ESG investing?,nijbla,Nuveen ESG vs iShares/Blackrock ESG

Azure is a popular choice because most enterprises naturally use Office 365, but it's a bit more clunky and non-intuitive to use IMHO.

Being able to spin up a web server and have it reachable from any AWS datacenter in the world, is just unreal. Developers design their applications around AWS's feature set, which simply is not the case for other cloud providers.

It's pretty clear with the switch of CEO to Andy Jassy that they believe they have peaked their revenue with ecommerce, and have a lot more to squeeze out of AWS. Cloud adoption still has A LOT of room in this decade.

I can absolutely see the comparisons to a holding company but in my opinion, the true deep value is from their legal SaaS business, not from their equities.  In this case, their equities provide a bottom value that the company can reach (similar to how ABBA once had a minimum floor value that was tied to the value of BABA).  

In this case, the deep value comes from Journal Tech which has about a hundred million dollars of revenue that can't be found anywhere on their financial statements.  The accounting practices of DJCO are horrid, but in a manner that can be truly beneficial to early investors since all of this locked-in revenue cannot be identified by stock screening algorithms used by medium to large financial institutions.  These revenues will begin appearing on DJCO's financial statements in a few years, at which point their margins will be incredible because the most labour-intensive work (i.e. configuration) will have already been completed whilst DJCO was not reporting revenue.

To quote Munger during the 2017 DJCO annual meeting, ""You can’t look at our financial statements and make very good judgments about what’s going to happen.""

With that said, I will take a look at the tickers that you recommended as I love looking at random (to me) companies and seeing if there is any value tucked away that is being mispriced by the market.  Cheers.",,

I'm looking to finally start investing and placing money into long term holds where I can just plop money into monthly and only look into it occasionally.

I've been working on this year being investment heavy after finally being debt free and have an emergency savings. I've placed some money into some pennystocks I believed in, but in reality I know those are just a gamble. Now, I'm looking into being responsible with my investments.

I'm 29, using fidelity. I don't really have a target goal, I just know this is something my future self will thank me for. I have a match contribution through my workplace's investing plans but it seems like there's less options to invest in? It seems more general than being able to select individual companies. But maybe that doesn't matter?

* Unit of Account

* **Store of Value**

* Standard of Deferred Payment

* Means of Exchange

BTC was intentionally created with a supply-cap of 21 million to avoid being an inflationary currency, like all current fiat equivelents. It's supposed to be money you can keep in money form without it losing value over time, that's clearly an intentional design of the currency, otherwise it would just have been inflationary which would have been easier to design altogether. Satoshi designed it as such to avoid it falling into the trap of inflationary fiat currencies that are not at all very good stores of value, because governments actively want to incentivize spending and investing.

Trust me, I've read the whitepaper, feel free to disagree with me, but don't accuse me of not having read it just because you didn't realize that 'store of value' was an integral function in the definition of money, and not something maxis just made up. I never said BTC was *only* a store of value, just that it was a store-of-value cryptocurrency, I highlight store of value because it's relevant when discussing BTC in relation to an asset like ETH, because ETH is inflationary.",,

Arcade tickets, like gift cards, are essentially just debt. [Cash on the other hand is defined as physical money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash).

The reason this category is important is because other forms of electronic money, like credit cards and bank accounts, are not actually cash, they are IOUs/debt.

This conversation is way off-track now, I can't have a discussion where you just declare cash is not money without backing it up, when any quick look at a dictionary will tell you that cash is *indeed* money.

617,,2021-05-12 19:20:46,t3_nawyv7,,investing,"A lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",nawyv7,The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortage

Some other comments have noted NJ’s credit profile as a reason not to buy their munis as the state could possibly declare bankruptcy and is relatively quite leveraged.

It’s worth noting that municipal bankruptcy are incredibly rare, especially when you compare them to corporate bonds and their default rates. There are only a dozen or so notably bankruptcies over the 20th century. The low historical default rates relative to their perceived credit quality culminated in the Connecticut attorney general suing rating agencies in 2008 for misrepresenting their credit quality and as a result forcing Connecticut taxpayers to pay unjustifiably high interest costs. I believe S&P settled with the state in 2015. So in general I believe munis have a tendency to be perceived more risky than they actually are, at least by the rating agencies. S&P rates US treasuries as AA+ and sone munis AAA.

That being said, at the state level the largest risk in my opinion are the pension plans. Pension benefits as a percentage of costs for municipalities, particularly states, have been going up. Their pension funding ratios have been trending down. This is because they promised employees / unions a retirement benefit based on 30+ year assumptions of rates from the 80s and 90s, and returns across the board have gone down since then. When municipal bankruptcies are declared, the municipality is usually forced to choose between its bond holders and its pension holders. In one of the largest municipal bankruptcies, the WPPSS (“Whoops”) bankruptcy of a Washington power plant, the Washington Supreme Court sided with the pensioners.

Therefore if I were to buy munis at the state level (I’m not currently - too young and too low an income tax bracket, but I intend to be a buyer as I get closer to retirement.

I personally would be unlikely to lend to a municipality with a funding ratio below 70%.

Also, Michael Lewis (Big Short, Liars Poker) has a great chapter on the California bankruptcies of the early 2000s that touches on the major pitfalls municipalities face in managing their debt in the following book:

Agfy also recently raised 147 million from their recent ipo and secondary offering. So add that into their cash. Their growth prospects and company guidance is phenomenal in my opinion. When the stock was trading in the 6s, company had more cash than the market cap, and for a tech company with such high growth, I believe the fair value of the stock is many multitudes what it is today. Greenhouse agriculture is future of high value crops like strawberries, tomatoes, etc in my opinion, and Agrify will cash in on that sector expansion with high profit margin software licensing.

for - you understand the industry and are in a better position to pick winners and losers       

against - you work in the industry and any industry wide negative event will hit you twice, once at your job and a second time in  your portfolio.  You are in effect concentrating  your risk exposure in one industry.               

If you don't know what you're doing I would recommend starting out with low cost index funds or life cycle funds.  If you have a really good feeling about a company in your industry, dedicate up to 10-20% maximum of your portfolio to individual stock picks and other higher risk investments.

VNYTX | 1.21% | 2.50%

This can effectively double the return profile post-tax for high income earners. They vary in method of repayment (general state obligation, special tax levy, etc.), location, and credit quality, which has been solid over a long period. You can get exposure buying individual bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and closed-end funds, my favorite. One reason is such funds often trade at a discount which boosts the tax-advantaged income. Another is leverage, also emphasizing the tax-advantaged income. MUC, for example, borrows about 40% against the portfolio at super cheap rates to buy more securities. It increases returns and adds volatility. From the end of 2019 to the low of the pandemic, MUC dropped from $14 to $10.76, or about 23%. That’s much better than equities but didn’t increase like US bonds at that same time. Now MUC has rebounded and outperformed while TLT is back to its pre-pandemic price. Anyway, you could make an argument individuals could sub munis for their bond allocation and pick up some yield at not much extra risk. The total muni market isn’t huge like government treasuries, so mostly bigger investors can’t make large allocations, so the littler investors have an opportunity. BBN is a nice fund of taxable muni bonds which at times over the years has yielded 6%+ and been a nice little compounder.",,

I have been pondering selling a ""hot stock"" that is at a peak, because part of it was an RSU (past the 6 month mark so no fees), and I am curious if I should.

I do think it will go down soon, but I also know it is useless to try to time a market/stock. However, I don't feel comfortable with the amount of stock I have in one stock (if that makes sense). So I would like to sell 3k of this fidelity stock, to buy 3k of a vanguard ETF.

I could wait a few months and just add 3k to the ETF in vanguard and not sell any of the fidelity stock, but I worry I will lose some of the free money from the RSU + stock at it's peak.

This is also the first time I've been in this situation, with a decent emergency fund, maxed 401k, planning to contribute to both mine and my spouse's roth, and HSA maxed end of 2021 (hopefully if no health issues).

So now I'm wondering if it's worth it to start looking at the stocks and moving things around. But, again, I don't know what I'm doing with stocks, so hesitant to sell/buy any except a couple hundred on meme stocks and basic investing through my job/company match.

* >  I worry I will lose some of the free money

That stock wasn't free.  It is regular old **taxable income** to you at the time the shares vested; you paid normal withholding taxes on it; and the value of the shares at vesting will be reported on your **W-2** the same as any other earned income.  So don't let the ""free money"" aspect of this cloud your judgement.

* Similarly, once the shares vested, you **own** them -- no different from any other shares you purchased on the open market.  Yeah, they're locked up for a while, but those shares have no loyalty to you, and you should have no particular loyalty to them just because you work there.  The decision to keep or sell should be less emotional that way.

I gather that this risk minimizing effect as a result of diversification also leads to less exposure of swings in currencies (when buying instruments in currencies other than that of your home countrys). However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

Example:

\- Citizen in Denmark that has a local currency DKK  
\- Buys *iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF* (due to low 0.20% expense ratio) in USD

Would the above person cancel out the positive effects of diversification in regards to currency swings because he would now simply be subject to DKK/USD swings? Or is the entire premise wrong?",nir88v,Buying World Trackers in a Different Currency

Caravana buys their cars at auction mainly, details and prepares them, sells them and stands behind them if their is an issue.  LOTZ does exactly the same except they are consigned.  To recognize revenue as they do must have been approved by auditors, lawyers etc pre SPAC.  So it really should be a moot point.

Focus instead on the 10 year track record.  They source cars cheaper, they process them, and they sell them.  The consignor gets more than through the auction process, the buyer pays a little less also.  So in a 1 trillion, totally fragmented used car business that moves +- 5% between good years and bad years there is virtually unlimited growth.

LOTZ has higher customer satisfaction scores than all their competitors.

There is no moat as anyone can copy their model easily, but that takes time.

Lol there are 9 muni bankruptcies right now in the entire US. That is basically nothing when you look at how many there are.  Also Puerto Ricos bankruptcy isnt even done. You dont know what the settlement is gonna be for bondholders. 

>which are roughly 66% for rated muni bonds.

I mean you're wrong....


>Understanding that recovery rates represent a margin of safety in the event a bond defaults, for rated general obligation bonds, the recovery rate is almost 100%. When a municipal issuer defaults on general obligation debt, the issuer is obligated to use every bit of taxation power at their disposal to satisfy bondholders. The full faith and credit of the issuer is the guarantee that is backing the bonds. For instance, a local issuer may be forced to increase property taxes dramatically, while a state may have to increase personal and or corporate income taxes. A county may have to sell off a major park or physical property. Whatever means can be used to return bondholder principal must be exercised. In other states, such as California for example, general obligation debt payment is mandated, by State constitution, to be paid back prior to fulfilling many of its other obligations.

823,gz3he2s,2021-05-22 21:25:51,t1_gz3he2s,t1_gz39m9o,investing,"Hey one thing you may consider.  Why not just put the money into a unit trust.  As an example PBT pays about 6% based on their last monthly dividend (about 2.1 cents per share) and share price (about $4.20 per share).  If the price of oil goes up (or even stays higher) then the units (shares) will probably go up in value, and as a bonus you can even get some tax advantages on selling the shares (but not the dividends) by 1031'ing into another unit trust or similar investment.  This is kinda complicated to explain but just realize you can defer taxes on gains in the share/ unit price by buying a similar investment and carefully following the rules.

As an added bonus for this particular stock/ trust, they just switched operators about 9 months ago (from Conoco to a group called Blackbeard) and the new operator has really picked up the drilling which has caused the oil pumped and thus sales (and stock price) to go up, but it looks like it may keep going up for at least another year (or it may not).

Do your own DD but there was another guy pumping this stock on reddit so you can look for his DD if you are interested. However be a bit warned. He was talking about the stock/ unit cost going up 400-500% and I just don't think that's going to happen, but it still should go up and even if it doesn't there is that 6% yield which will also probably go up.",,

Generally speaking you are talking about a trailing stop.  A trailing stop follows the price up. Once the price tops, your stop is set as whatever you put in.  Maybe you put 2% or 50 cents.  If the price falls to your current stop it will trigger an order.  If the price falls but doesn't hit your stop then rises again, your stop will follow it up again to the next high. 

The risk is getting stopped out too soon.  You can't set your trailing stop to begin above the current price.  Which means if it dips as soon as you set it, you are stopped out.  The other risk is volatility. If the stock price is trending up but is bouncing on the way up, it can hit your stop and execute.

This page is useful for understanding this concept with examples.  https://tradingsim.com/blog/set-trailing-stop/

If you want a more precise order type, some brokers offer stop limit orders, which is basically a mechanism to place a limit order once a trigger price is reached. Anything beyond that is algorithmic trading and it's very specialized. If you're a programmer, you might be able to build a program to do this using your broker's API, but don't expect a standard interface from your broker for something like that.",,

The reality is most individual investors get a vibe about a company, look at the price chart and anchor on a price, then estimate if the company is over or under-valued based on the anchor. The prices themselves for the purpose of the investor is totally detached from the actual financial performance of the company, because that was not a consideration for the investor, and so the whole thing is just rolling the dice. 

Very few individual investors crack open a balance sheet and income statement, make conservative estimates for revenue growth, determine a reasonable discount rate for the risk of the firm, then compare that to the market cap. 

So the difference for them between being married to a position and being patient is really just how many other cognitive and emotional biases are acting on them which may lead to worse performance than guessing",,

Of the dollar on the other hand is strengthened your purchasing power is lowered, a share may cost 55-60DKK each. This also means all the shares you already bought/own has *increased in value* by as much.

If I bought a share in Brazil exactly one year ago and I bought one share in USA one year ago and I sold both shares today, I would have made the exact same profit/loss. This is because when you buy a stock you are not holding the currency that you used to purchase it. Doesn’t matter if you buy apple stock in USA, Russia, London, or Brazil, it’s all the same. 

TD is listed in both USA and Canada and you can buy on one exchange and journal to the other and sell it there. But TD is different when it comes to currency risk. Since TD’s business is mostly done in Canadian dollars when you buy TD (doesn’t matter if you buy in USD or CAD) you are exposing yourself to CAD risk. 

Apple might actually hedge against foreign currencies, in which case buying apple would carry currency risk. 

If you are buying a basket of companies that operate in different currencies then you are pretty much hedged against currency risk, you might lose some on one currency but make it up on another.
