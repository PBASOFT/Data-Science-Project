As of now the only way Russians can buy spce is from the St Petersburg exchange. St Petersburg is known to buy company stocks and re-sell them without the permission of the company… 

April 2018: 
“Under Russian securities laws, a Russian stock exchange can unilaterally admit foreign securities to trading without the consent of the issuer of such securities. In the last several years, the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange admitted securities of a number of foreign companies to trading in a similar fashion.”

So big investors don’t trade there for that reason.. they could be forced to sell their shares, and when they buy shares they have to pay “extra” on them. Our Russian friends always complain about the stock price, when they try to buy we post one number… they see another “higher to buy” lower to sell etc… because of a “delay”.

Anyways, if you noticed during the flight many Russian investors attended the after party of SPCE. Then days later SPCE announced they’ll officially list in the Moscow exchange. 

Is this a coincidence? No. Russian investors are interested in this company, next week we will see “fresh” money buying shares and holding them. 

We will see a difference, just watch!",nmzbs7,SPCE - next week in new exchange

Among the sea of shitposts, memes, gain and loss porn, Wallstreetbets also has some of the best DD I have ever read. From $PRPL, to steel gang, to $GME and beyond, there has been a wealth of incredible DDs on WSB. Unfortunately, there are two issues with DD posted on WSB:

- It is easy to miss the high quality DD among the memes and shitposts
- Once a post has reached the front page and gained thousands of upvotes, the ticker being recommended may already have seen the implied vol on call options shoot up enormously. Sometimes, depending on the ticker, the popularity of a DD post may even move the stock price itself.

Given the wealth of information contained in these DD posts, it would be useful to have an alert system to inform whether a new DD post has been created, and particularly, one that is perceived to be of high enough quality to reach the front page through Reddit's upvote system. 

# My Solution: a Python WSB DD scraper and alert system

I built a Python tool that scrapes WSB every 5 minutes throughout the day and searches through posts which are flaired as ""DD"" and are 30-35 minutes old. Several pieces of information are extracted from those posts, such as their score, the authors' karma, average comment sentiment, as well as a couple engineered features. This information is stored in a dataframe which contains all the day's DD posts. The user can elect to receive email alerts if one of those DD posts reaches the front page (defined as the top 25 posts when sorted under ""Hot""). In addition, the user has the ability to include a model to predict which posts will reach the front page in advance based on the features being scraped. If included, the tool will send email alert when a post is scraped which has a high probability of reaching the front page.

If interested, you can access the code here:
https://github.com/CuriousByNature/WSBFrontPageAlert

The README has a full set of instructions for executing the code. The repository also comes with a sample model object trained to predict whether posts will reach the front page using only on one of my engineered features. The model is able to make predictions with just under 90% out-of-sample precision.


I hope you guys enjoy this tool as much as I have!",nn0q2o,Get Alerted of High Quality DD Posts

I am posting here since it was removed from [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/). I apologize to the mods if this is the right content for this sub.

With the popularity of stock trading at an all-time high, I just wanted to give a small PSA and a note about my experience joining stock trading groups on discord.

Long story short, I have searched around a few different discords to join a community I could learn more about stocks and trading. I can say without a doubt, that the vast majority of them have the following scheme attached to it:

1. Are pump and dumps where the admin, claiming to be an expert, will post a daily watchlist to encourage people to buy into stocks they already have a position in.
2. Are setup to convince people they need to subscribe to daily video and ""secret advice"" in order to make a quick buck.

Some of the people that run these discords are competent and I can see use manipulation tactics to come off as an authority on subject matters and encourage group think to forward the two objectives above. If you understand and learn the fundamentals of investing, you can tell they lack substance, but people green to investing can easily be enticed.

Be careful and research into communities you plan on joining. A few common red flags of toxic stock discords I have found include:

1. Stocks recommendations that constantly change on a daily basis.
2. Cult-like praise for public figures like Elon Musk.
3. Using words and tactics to encourage group-think (Such as ""stock fam"" and encouraging the posting of daily profits).
4. Due diligence that amounts to ""This company looks dope, they have a cool product,"" or ""Their product is the future"" without providing any knowledge of fundamentals, such as finance and balance sheet.

This may sound silly, but there are people out there who are looking to capitalize hard on this craze. Some will come off as smart and can be charismatic. If you haven't read into the fundamentals of finance and investing, their advice looks very enticing.

If you are looking for a community to join, be careful and always scrutinize people's suggestions.",nn1f5a,Be wary of stock discords

If is a stock cannot do that, it’s dead weight and the money better invested in another stock.

If a stock looses a significant amount of its value, usually there is a reason to it. There is no reason to think that the value recovers fast.

But the market is growing for >20 years and so are Index Fonds. That is the Performance that every stock has to compete with. There is no reason to sit on a loss and wait  when there are many options to negate the loss.

In a professional environment,  the Maximum loss decides how many shares will be bought in the first place.

Reacting trends is important to make long term money. 

After 20 years of investment, i still loose money on many stocks.
The important thing is, that I got stopped out before I loose to much.  I may come back when they are trending again.

I know there is an ongoing fight between trend following scene and fundamental analysis folk. I guess it’s a valid argument hat the fundamentalists usually jump on the train early and make more money on a promising stock.

But it’s also true that many of them sit on their stocks for years and decades because „fundamentals are good and it’s undervalued“. 

Truth is, good fundamentals are worth nothing if you are the only one noticing it. You need the the trend at some point.
If the fundamentals are that good, the trend might come at some point. But that might take many years - time that the money would be better spend in trending investments or etf „parking spots“.",,

&#x200B;

""ViacomCBS Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAC; VIACA) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share on both its Class A and Class B Common Stock. The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2021.

&#x200B;

At the same time, the Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.5493 per share on its 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: VIACP). The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2021.""

&#x200B;

Currently, VIAC is trading at about $42.50/share, while VIACP is trading at about $74/share, so VIACP carries less than a 2x premium over VIAC. But the dividend is 6x as much as the class A and class B shares. Can I just sell all my VIAC and get a 6x higher dividend on July 1?",nn20k5,Dividends on various classes of ViacomCBS stock.

This is the exact same reaction faced by bear traders when they see a massive short squeeze - they'll buy to cover a bunch of their positions to take profits & reduce short exposure.

This leads to their respective short stocks going up as the artificial weight is lifted, which then attracts swing traders, adding to the momentum. And that becomes a major rally - not because of any underlying fundamental, but because of market forces.",,

MO dropped a month or so back on news that Biden wants to legislate lower nicotine content. Obviously that hasn’t passed or even been introduced yet but if it does pass could effect them. It’s why MO went from $52 to $47, although it’s been recovering nicely. 

Second, while I agree on the weed play, keep in mind it’s under anti-trust review from the FTC because of the large interest it acquired in JUUL (the weed play). I assume if they lose they will have to divest themselves of JUUL and we lose our covert weed play to some degree, though I still think MO will get involved after federal legalization. 

In short, if you are okay with those risks, then it’s a good buy in price now and has potential later with weed legalization, but those are some decent sized risks.

However, there are a few exceptions that you can withdraw early, such as when you're a first time home buyer. Also you can withdraw money early from your 401K through your Roth IRA (kind of a loophole, called Roth IRA conversion ladder), but that's a bit more complex.  

Overall, a Roth IRA is one of the absolute best financial vehicles you can have, and I highly recommend maxing it out every single year, and not to withdraw an (even the original amounts you put in). Lemme know if you have any questions..",,

In some cases it might not matter. European investors probably have some indication if things are perceived as better or slightly riskier than the day before. The same thing American investors will react to when markets open. It really just becomes a series of small ups and downs to see if one market perceives the price a little lower or higher.

What I would watch out for are quarterly reporting days. Many report at end of market in the US, which means the European market would trade first knowing the results. A few companies release in the morning, when the European markets might still be open. I would just make sure you get the information you need before trading.",,

It makes sense to some degree but you've got to look at the fundamentals.  I own PM because of their international exposure, and also because they're killing it with IQOS. But MO is not in the same position at all... it truly is a disappearing market for them as a US-only company.",,

You're picking winners in a crowded and desperate market there and (I think) the reality of reopening won't live up to the anticipation that the stock market built in. Real estate depends on what sector you're in, is it residential building or commercial? If commercial I see less upside than residential construction but not a bad thing to hold onto.

I'd personally hold Disney, the management is excellent, the price is on what seems like a durable positive trend, and with reopening I expect a lot of good news coming for them (disclosure, I have stock in DIS).

If you’re intrinsically interested in investing and want to dive deeper, then I’d put some time into learning how to interpret a company’s financial statements, learn how to evaluate the fair price of a company, etc. In the long-term, it’ll be important to be invested in companies you like at the right price. There’s lots of information you can find to add these valuation tools to your toolbox. 

If you want a more passive approach that allows you to not think as much about it, then I’d focus more of your resources into broad market etf’s like VOO/VTI. In fact, both VOO and VTI have considerable overlap. A lot of people would suggest you just invest in one, and I think most would suggest VTI. However, there’s significant overlap and the difference in gains will be minimal. Another etf that could compliment VTI/VOO is an international-exclusive etf like VXUS. Not everyone invests in international etf’s though, so it’s just your personal preference. If you do, I would still keep a majority of it in VTI/VOO (like 80:20 or at most 70:30)

Just my opinions. I’m still learning. Best of luck!",,

What they have are a bid, ask, and last.  The last is what is commonly referred to as the price, and it is the last price the stock traded at.  However you cannot make a trade at that price.  If you are buying you can only buy at the ask or higher meaning you can only buy at the price someone is willing to sell to you at.  You can set a limit and refuse to buy above a certain price but if the ask is higher than that your order will not be filled.  The same thing is true of selling but that is based on the highest bid.  What this means is that the price can change without any trades happening.  You can see this on very illiquid markets like out of the money options where both the bid/ask are well above or below the last meaning you will never get the last price for a new trade.  This also happens when a stock is halted.  When it resumes it will usually open a lot higher or lower than where it was previously trading.

In my honest opinion viac is going to rise also though so you get a dividend and you get appreciation of share price so returns will be higher.    
    
Dividend companies normally drop in share price after issuing dividends also. Because cash is removed from the company and given to shareholders.

You need to start big and not small. You need to save for retirement, but first....  Learn basics to investing and not just doing short term trades of single stocks.

You need a retirement account, tax advantaged and put assets into market index funds that are safer. It isn't going for the big scores at once, but it safe to put larger assets into. You will get more back, by not feeling a need to be shy with only small amounts of money. It isn't the big score, but the advantage is you can safely put more money into it and time is your friend. The longer it is invested, the more it gains.

Then take a small portion of money on the side and you can work on individual stock trades. Don't risk so much that you can't lose it and were depending on that amount for retirement.

Whenever someone mentions a big move in a stock, the expert is always quick to say, “Take profits. It doubled? Oh yeah, secure those gains.”

I’ve also heard a lot of them say that if they want to continue speculating on the stock, they will take out their initial investment and leave the profits in. That way, whatever happens, they are risking 0% of their capital. 

The other thing I hear a lot is, “Manage your risk, and the profits will take care of themselves” or “Live to trade another day.”",,

Plus their forward P/E is justified from their insane growth, which has been happening even despite the chip shortage. There is a high demand for their current products that will only grow and they are getting into CPUs now. And even more forward looking, they are the overwhelming leader in AI with CUDA so I just don't see their growth slowing any time soon.
