Volitilty decay causes leveraged ETFs to generally underperform their non-leveraged counterparts (contrary to what some of the other comments here claim).

To explain volatility decay, say a stock goes down 10% - it's at 90% it's original value. Then it goes up 10% the next day. The stock is now at 99% (90% x 110%) of original value - NOT 100%.

If you 3x leveraged that stock - the first day, you would have 70% of original value. The next day, you would only have 91% (70% x 130%). So you lost 9x the money, despite only having 3x the leverage.

Let's give another example where the a goes up 15% and then down 10%. The 1x would end up at 103.5% of original value. The 3x fund ends up only at 101.5%.",,

If climate change is that big of a problem for humanity (and I mostly think it is), then it's our society's job to vote a government that will regulate and legislate to stop these type of things from happening. (I think a global carbon tax is the single best legislation that could be introduced to fight climate change) I don't think it's the role of private companies to be at the forefront of these changes \*\*at the expense of shareholders\*\*.

I don’t think it’s particularly much of a secret, but just hear me out. They tend to start up a small business operation for a while, and just run within their org. If things turn out well at the experimental stage, they invest hard and fast, through acquisition and/or expanding the operation rapidly.

I’m looking at some tidbits where they’re mentioning employee-internal health services, basically clinics with doctors and such.

It seems to me this is a classic R&D effort inside a controlled environment. If they find they have a special sauce that could work in the marketplace, I would imagine there is going to be an announcement at one point where they’ll position a new Amazon product (whatever it’s going to be branded as, but I wouldn’t bat an eyelash if it was simply Amazon Health).

It’s an enormously profitable industry, it’s very hard to make inroads without serious capital and lobbying capacity, and Amazon has both. The incumbents have for the most part a pretty lousy customer experience, and between the software, the retail, and policy influence experience, I’d wager there is some serious potential. Add to this the currently heightened awareness about health care facilities and services.

I believe there is a 2 year time frame before there would be a significant announcement that would essentially put PPOs and HMOs on notice and make them sweat. There are plenty of successful boutique providers, small local hospitals, specialty clinics, a handful of franchises, but they’re all small scale. Acquiring a business that has the right real estate, and then implementing a health services model that allows people to get most ambulatory treatments without the enormous hassle, admin overhead, and time.... seems like a solid proposition in my book.

There are two things to consider.

1)  hydrocarbons are one of the most dense energy storage mediums in existence, and can be transmitted physically, with minimal infrastructure, nearly losslessly.  This is a massive advantage that will always make it important in certain systems, like jet fuel, or....

2) developing markets.  Most ""1st world"" countries use anywhere between 10 to 100 times the energy per capita of their developing counterparts.  For these developing markets to...well...develop, they need access to energy.  Hydrocarbons are the easiest way to expand energy access for these markets.  We arent going to power Africa with wind and solar, they will be powered with nat gas etc.   Additionally there are massive quantities of infrastructure they need to build that will require hydrocarbons to create.  The us has something like 20 B tons of asphalt on its roads.  Thats from oil.  To build out the roads needed to develop these countries that will be needed.

Same goes for all of the plastics/elastomers/etc that will be needed to build their cars, power systems, hospitals, you name it.  

Now think of the scale of the number of people in ""developed"" countries pulling the maximum energy draw, and the number of people who need to expand their draw (and the corresponding geography to build up).   There is a borderline immeasurable need for enhanced power and hydrocarbon product generation globally.

And before we say ""ok but won't that just make climate change worse?""  Well, yes and no.  Many of these poorer countries are meeting the very limited demand thay do meet with absolutely terrible methods.  Coal, straight up wood burning, simply replacing these with nat gas could massively reduce the global co2 emissions while simultaneously expanding the accessible BTUs.

Its a complex issue, no doubt, but we have to challenge the privilege of our perception when we think conservation is globally feasible.   In the developed world we should 100% be aiming to reduce hydrocarbon usage ASAP, but in the rest of the world we should not only plan for its expansion, but encourage and celebrate it.

Think of it like food.   I take time and care to think about sustainable agriculture and organic etc Yada Yada, but when it comes to starvation that is not the first response.

These people don't need the perfect energy source, they need *any* energy source, and Nat Gas and liquid hydrocarbons are the best option for rapid expansion, development, and limited pollution that exist.",,

85,,2021-05-26 22:55:30,t3_nltrog,,investing," **Business:**

LMP Motors $LMPX 's business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. LMPX Rents or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. LMPX then sells its inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process.

**IPO and Price History:**

LMPX IPO'd in December 2019 at 5$ per share and has steadily increased throughout the past 18 months, reaching a peak of $45 earlier this year. It has since retraced in price and is currently trading at $15.8. This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M.

**Revenue Growth and Forecast:**

LMPX reported 10.8m of revenues in 2019 and grew revenues to 30.4m for 2020. Representing a 180% increase in Revenues YoY.

LMPX forecasted revenues of 29m to 31m for Q1 2021 representing a 650% increase in revenues from Q4 2020.

LMPX full year 2021 revenues forecasted at 535 million

Shareholders called out the CEO on these revenues forecasts after Q4 results and the stock subsequently sold off.

**Q1 2021 Earnings Preliminary Numbers (To be reported after close tomorrow)**

LMPX quietly released its preliminary numbers last week directly to the SEC.

Reporting Revenues of $33m, representing 725% increase in revenues from the previous quarter.

Gross profit increased to 6M from 500k the previous quarter.

Cash increased of 1.4M to 19.4m through net operating cash flows.

These preliminary numbers beat the Q1 Guidance of 29M-31M by 15%.

The earnings call tomorrow will prove to shareholders and investors that this company is achieving substantial growth and the the forecasts are obtainable.

Guidance for the 2021 year is expected to increase above its 535 million to 570 million+.

**EBITDA:** EBITDA expected at 4.4% for 2021 of total revenues amounting to 25million which is to be used for repayment of loans on recent acquisitions.

**Valuation to Peers:**

**CVNA:**

Market Cap of 44.7B

Sales of 5.5B

P/S: 8.12

Revenue growth YoY: 41%

**VRM:**

Market Cap of 5.9B

Sales of 1.3B

P/S: 4.53

Revenue growth YoY: 14%

**LMPX:**

Market Cap of 158M

Sales of : 33M for Q1 (570M 2021 full year)

P/S: 0.27 (based on 2021 revenue Guidance)

Revenue growth YoY: 1766% (2020 to 2021 growth)

**LMPX** **Fair Value based on 2021 Sales:**

Market Cap: 2.5B

Share price: $256

P/S: 4.5

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 535 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings resulting in increased guidance.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after tomorrows earnings resulting in a even smaller tradeable float.

**Summary:**

LMPX will report revenues of 33M tomorrow representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". This earnings report will beat expectations by 10-15% and Revenue guidance is expected to be bumped higher to the high 570 million range. New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader. If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 550M+ revenue for 2021 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $250+ a share representing a 1582% increase from its current share price.

Get in on the ground floor tomorrow before the earnings call. LMPX ran today as investors started to catch on to the SEC filing of preliminary numbers. We should see a 20% + move after hours tomorrow and quick run back to its ATH of $45.",nltrog,LMPX - LMP Motors - Growth Monster and Earnings Beat Coming Tomorrow

>  
>hydrocarbons are one of the most dense energy storage mediums in existence, and can be transmitted physically, with minimal infrastructure, nearly losslessly.  This is a massive advantage that will always make it important in certain systems, like jet fuel, or....developing markets. 

I thought about this recently that it's pretty ironic that Elon Musk is pushing for electric cars and renewable energy but in order for his company Space X to work, he needs all the fossil fuels he can get. So in a way, Tesla can be a self serving company by getting everyone else to get off fossil fuels and he and other space companies can just hoard all the fuel for rockets lol. I mean theoretically. 

And with all this venture into space, rocket fuel will need fossil fuels too. I did wonder about nuclear energy but apparently that's only if you're trying to go to mars. I think if we used nuclear for low earth orbit, wouldn't the nuclear waste/radiation just fall back down or contaminate us somehow?  

>  
>  
> Most ""1st world"" countries use anywhere between 10 to 100 times the energy per capita of their developing counterparts.  For these developing markets to...well...develop, they need access to energy.  Hydrocarbons are the easiest way to expand energy access for these markets because you can transport it so damned easily. We arent going to power Africa with wind and solar, they will be powered with nat gas etc.   Additionally there are massive quantities of infrastructure they need to build that will require hydrocarbons to create.  The us has something like 20 B tons of asphalt on its roads.  Thats from oil.  To build out the roads needed to develop these countries that will be needed.

Hmm I was hoping that developing countries could leapfrog developed countries by going straight to renewable, kind of like how they leapfrogged from landlines to cellphones or other outdated tech like fax vs email since they didn't have the infrastructure for older tech. 

Even if developed countries were to say subsidize or invest in renewable projects in Africa, you still think that wouldn't be possible? That's too bad since Africa has so much sun lol. You would think you could harvest a ton of solar energy in the Sahara but I guess your point is the storage and transportation of renewable energy is much more difficult. 

&#x200B;

>Same goes for all of the plastics/elastomers/etc that will be needed to build their cars, power systems, hospitals, you name it.  
>  
>Now think of the scale of the number of people in ""developed"" countries pulling the maximum energy draw, and the number of people who need to expand their draw (and the corresponding geography to build up).   There is a borderline immeasurable need for enhanced power and hydrocarbon product generation globally.  
>  
>And before we say ""ok but won't that just make climate change worse?""  Well, yes and no.  Many of these poorer countries are meeting the very limited demand thay do meet with absolutely terrible methods.  Coal, straight up wood burning, simply replacing these with nat gas could massively reduce the global co2 emissions while simultaneously expanding the accessible BTUs.  
>  
>Its a complex issue, no doubt, but we have to challenge the privilege of our perception when we think conservation is globally feasible.   In the developed world we should 100% be aiming to reduce hydrocarbon usage ASAP, but in the rest of the world we should not only plan for its expansion, but encourage and celebrate it.  
>  
>Think of it like food.   I take time and care to think about sustainable agriculture and organic etc Yada Yada, but when it comes to starvation that is not the first response.  
>  
>These people don't need the perfect energy source, they need any energy source, and Nat Gas and liquid hydrocarbons are the best option for rapid expansion, development, and limited pollution that exist.

Rockets actually dont use refined products, they are coming from chemicals.  The difference is that a refined product requires minimal modification to be made.  You could probably trace it back to fossil fuels in today's market but at the volume they are being used it could be sourced from bio/plastics pretty easily long term.

>Hmm I was hoping that developing countries could leapfrog developed countries by going straight to renewable

>Even if developed countries were to say subsidize or invest in renewable projects in Africa, you still think that wouldn't be possible?

Highly unlikely.   But not impossible.   The up front asset/capex expenditure for renewables is much larger than for hydrocarbon, generally.  Lots of steel on the ground.  Could work though, look at iceland and geo, but requires a very stable government to pull off.

I think we'll see a bit of both, but hydrocarbons will be be the dominant source in these markets for years to come",,

125,,2021-05-26 23:17:33,t3_nlu7ln,,investing,"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today’s price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today’s price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

Therefore,i switched my SCHH to VNQ. I'm thinking about switching my SCHE to VWO because from my little research, VWO is more diversified and they pay dividends quarterly. Unlike SCHE that plays dividends yearly and is less diversified in terms of number of allocations. VWO has a bigger AUM, though a slightly lesser yield than SCHE.

158,gzkrsdk,2021-05-26 23:38:44,t1_gzkrsdk,t3_nlccgx,investing,"Hey all,

I've always been an index fund investor. In February (bad timing), I liquidated and built a portfolio of individual stocks with many tech stocks and growth companies. Two of those companies were Lemonade and Appian, which were both touted on Motley Fool. I'm down a lot on both of these stocks, and really don't feel good about them (Lemonade in particular). I've wanted to hold onto these stocks in hopes that I can at least recoup my losses there. But the more I think about it, I bought these stocks when they were very overvalued, and I have no reason to believe they are going to perform in the future.

I'm faced with a decision I've never really had to make before. Dare I just sell these stocks at a big loss in order to put what remains into something safer or that I at least feel positive about? Am I jumping the gun? Or would waiting just be kicking the can, missing opportunity and generating greater losses for my portfolio? I realize there is no certainty to be found here. Can anyone share similar experiences? 

Thanks.",,

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost

\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores.  Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices.  This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year.  Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels.",,

And the reason for dividends over selling derivatives is the risk reward is much better. All I’m gonna say, is theres a reason that Implied Volatility is high on those covered call premiums, and volatility cuts both ways. Covered calls are great until you’re holding the underlying 3pts below your cost basis and you can sell an atm call for .5pts. Now you’re just averaging down like the rest of us “buy and holders”. Might as well just buy a good company with a solid dividend and ride it out.

>Here’s how the company did:

>* Earnings: Loss of 70 cents per share
* Revenue: $228.9 million, vs. $212.9 million expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

>Revenue grew 110% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 30, according to a statement. In the previous quarter revenue increased by 117%. The company’s net loss swelled to $203.2 million from $93.6 million.

>For the full 2022 fiscal year Snowflake called for $1.020 billion to $1.035 billion in product revenue, which at the middle of the range implies 86% growth and is more than the $1.02 billion FactSet consensus.

Is Lemonade a good investment at its current price? The long-term expectation for the S&P 500 is 10% annualized (\~7-8% adjusting for inflation). I'll leave aside the whole ""do you think forward yield will be lower?"" thing - neither here nor there.

10% annualized over 10 years would mean the market cap needs to grow to $13.25 billion. Most insurance companies trade at 1-2x revenue, so let's say Lemonade needs $6.6 billion in revenue in 10 years to be fairly priced today. If they continue growing at a 40% annualized pace for 10 years (unlikely), they'll have $2.8 billion in revenue in year 10. $2.8B is only 42% of the target $6.6B needed to get a 10% annualized ROI.

You can work out all the math yourself, if you think it's worth the effort. Think realistically about how much Lemonade can grow, is there going to be more competition or are they the only company that can do what they're doing?

I zoomed in, but you'll have to also zoom out. Lemonade isn't the only company in the world. Trupanion $TRUP grew revenue 31% from 2019 to 2020, and its P/S ratio is only 6.6 (compared to \~55 for LMND). You have plenty of options, just need a diversified group of investments that's likely to return a modest 10% annually, altogether. Being overweight in a couple of losers will blow up that plan.

I personally would much sooner bet on FAANG stocks returning 10%+ annually over the next 10 years, than Lemonade (if LMND were $25 today, it might be a tough choice). FAANG as a group could do 15%, maybe 20% annually - wouldn't take much more than a sustained 15% growth to get there.

Last thing I'll say - one bad quarter will tank LMND, just like how FSLY got wiped out recently. That's what happens when years of growth are priced in, you could miss on revenue by a few million, and you're freefalling.",,

Even if 100% of new vehicles sold were electric, it would take at least 10 years for petroleum demand to become negligible. Furthermore, demand for plastics, polymers, asphalt, jet fuel, etc. is only set to grow. 
And oil and natural gas are way too important for forex and liquidity for an overly quick transition.

I just turned 30, and while my total income is pretty low at  
only about $13,500ish a year (YA, Phlebotomy Jobs suck, apparently...), my  
Living costs are ALSO pretty low, only roughly $600-700 a month. This is  
combination of low rent, the lack of any real vices (I don't smoke, drink, do  
any kind of drugs etc etc) and not really going out and doing anything. Most of  
my entertainment comes in the form of games and novels and the like.   
Suffice to say, that means despite being what most would  
consider ""Poor"", I've not really had to ""struggle"" with  
much. Even now, I've got about $2,000 invested in stocks that I play around  
with and use to learn, as well as about $4,000 in savings for emergencies.  
That's even AFTER buy a top of the line 10th gen computer just recently to  
replace my old one (again, even being ""poor"" by most standards).   
Now I know this probably isn't impressive to a lot of people  
here, more so those who make a lot more and probably quicker too, but for where  
I am and what I've had available to me, I think I'm going pretty well. That  
being said, I know I have to start planning for the Future as well.   
The Only problem Is, I don't really know HOW. My family had  
always been the ""spend it while you have it"" kind, or spent it on  
cigs, booze and drugs, so I never really learned that kind of stuff.   
I've tried my best to escape from that, but without knowing WHAT to look for, its been a slow process. 

Thus I'd thought I'd try asking here. 

Basically what I'm looking for (if you've managed to read this far) is any kind of resources on how someone can start a 401k, IRA or other such retirement plan in my setting. What do I need to look for? What Kind of Information am I going to need to collect? What are some pitfalls to watch out for? Are there better options? etc etc etc.

Graphene is a revolutionary material and I believe certain applications could be very profitable if executed properly. What I’m looking for is a company with 
-A cash pile on the balance sheet to support growth
-A plan to Scale
-Groundbreaking Application (3D Printing, Battery Storage, etc.)
-Solid Management

I looked into quite a few but most seem pretty cash poor.

Currently most impressed by Graphene Manufacturing as they manufacture pure Graphene using methane and are beginning to use it in batteries. But still not enthralled with the company, and would like to discuss other options. 

Also do you ever think that a Graphene ETF would be a good idea or feasible, would it be worth investing in?

I would also recommend investopedia to do some reading on retirement accounts.


But regarding your questions, IRAs are the easier topic so I’ll tackle that first. IRAs are personal retirement accounts that anyone can open. There are primarily two types of IRAs (technically a lot more, but I’ll stick with those two). These are known as a Traditional IRA and an Roth IRA. Both allow tax free growth (so no taxes on selling stocks or dividends in these accounts). This means the money grows much quicker. The difference between a traditional vs an Roth, is that a traditional IRA taxes you upon withdrawal, while with a Roth, you put post tax money in and can withdraw without any taxes. Contribution limits to IRAS (either Roth or Traditional) are 6,000 dollars of EARNED income per year. After 6000 dollars, you’re no longer allowed to contribute more.


Starting an IRA is very easy - with both Fidelity and Vanguard, the process is super quick - usually involves just applying with your social security + basic details. I recommend these two companies too, because they’re very reliable with good customer service. M1 finance is also pretty good as well.

One major pitfall to avoid - make sure you actually invest the money. A lot of people don’t realize but IRAs are investment accounts - not actual investments. You need to put the money inside the account into an investment in order to have it grow. Too many horror stories of people who just put money into the account and don’t invest it (I remember one story about a lady who put in 50k into her accounts, which would have grown to 300k if she’d invested it, but because she didn’t, it stayed at 50k). 

For your income - I would recommend an Roth. Because you are at a fairly low tax rate right now, a Roth will be good in case your retirement income is higher, or if tax laws change in the future.",,

Some people said you can withdraw from your Roth without penalties but I honestly can't recall so I wouldn't contribute more until you know.

445,gzle84h,2021-05-27 02:54:49,t1_gzle84h,t1_gzlcmaq,investing,"Yep, you're on the right track. Definitely go for a Roth IRA specifically though, and not a traditional IRA since you're in a low income tax bracket currently. All 3 of those companies should be fine and have a straightforward process on their website to set up the Roth IRA.

Keep in mind that the max per year you can invest in an IRA is $6000 per year, and you can only invest ""earned income"" from that tax year, which is basically any money earned from working for a wage. For example, if most of your money during the year came from something like investment income or unemployment checks, and you only earned 2,500 from a normal job, the most you could contribute for that year would be 2,500, since you didnt have enough earned income to qualify for contributing more. But with your current income you wont have to worry about that and could contribute up to 6,000 per year, although that would require you to live extraordinarily frugally to max it out on that income.

It's an interesting idea to save in a ""city-indexed real estate fund"" as a way to track RE appreciation in your market, but even within a city, property values can vary quite a bit. It is hard to execute well in real estate. There aren't many details provided in that link, but I imagine these are most likely going to be crowd funded private investments, and nothing like publicly traded REITs or ETFs.

First, the idea of ""indexing"" to your neighborhood while saving for a home doesn't entirely hold up. When you are saving, you mostly only need to worry about the purchase price of the home. But when you own a piece of real estate, there is more to real estate return than just the appreciation (or depreciation) of property price. You're forgetting rent, repairs, management, taxes, maintenance, etc., which you would account for while investing in real estate.

Drawbacks are obvious when compared to publicly traded REITs. Concentrated bets, high fees, illiquid, limited fund/manager track record, conflicts of interest (property manager?). Investors taking concentrated bets usually want to know what they are buying and control or limit some of these risks. And real estate is illiquid. Without a public market, I imagine the investors in a ""city-indexed fund"" would not be free to redeem any time. If you have more money to invest, larger real estate funds and private REITs do exist. 

At this time, if you don't have a lot of money, I think the only real option is publicly traded REITs.",,

I think it could be a good deal longer term for AT&T - they unload a lot of their debt and can focus solely on telecom instead of trying to expand into more areas where they arguably didn't need to be. So, it should streamline them some and has the potential to unlock some growth in the share price and not just the dividend. That being said, can current management manage not to trip over their you know what's and enter into another not so great deal?

As for NewCo, it'll be interesting. HBO Max has a pretty solid catalog to compete with Netflix, Disney+, etc. And there are a lot of people who love their Discovery shows. However, they're going to come out of the deal with a lot of debt moving over from AT&T, so I think it remains to be seen whether that will hamper their growth in an industry where you need a lot of cash to dump into content. I am fairly certain that they won't pay a dividend (though I suppose they could start with a small one  but I'm not sure of the point if they go that route), so those looking for an equal dividend to their T shares may want/need to sell immediately and warp it back into something paying a dividend.

I have 200 shares of T and I haven't decided whether I'll hold or sell just yet. If it pops back up into the $32-$33 range, I may sell, take a little profit, and wait to see what happens. But, I may also hold and just see what happens with the deal and go from there.",,

There’s general ideas of what they could be. AI, robotics, quantum computers, fusion or in this case graphene. And while there are companies working on them, most are not publicly traded.  Even big conglomerates that are working on future technology like Amazon, Google or IBM might have research and development teams, but it is not anywhere near a major part of their business.

Once in a while a company will come out with a revolutionary idea and be able to develop the technology to mass produce it and make it profitable, let’s use Tesla as an example. Tesla has been making headlines for years, all the way back when they came out with the original roadster, but investors were super wary of them because it was doubtful that they could make cars on a mass scale, and have people buy them.

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

- 50% american stocks (market ETF)
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
- 15 % India (market ETF)
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
- 10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

533,,2021-05-19 16:40:46,t3_ngamt2,,investing,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. Under this program, the company intends to repurchase up to $4 billion of outstanding AMD common stock. AMD expects to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by the company’s strong operational results.  


“Today’s announcement reflects our confidence in AMD’s business and the successful execution of our multi-year growth strategy,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “Our strong financial results and growing cash generation enable us to invest in the business and begin returning capital to our shareholders.”

Under this program, which is designed to return value to AMD stockholders, offset dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company will repurchase stock in the open market. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.",ngavio,AMD Announces $4 Billion Share Repurchase Program

536,,2021-05-20 01:49:50,t3_ngnide,,investing,"New Investor - Everything I've read says to buy a mutual fund with low expense ratios as the fees add up and you compound more money with lower fees. 

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

&#x200B;

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):** 

\-Expense ratio 0.015%, 1yr +45.97%, 5yr +23.41%, 10yr +14.16%

**Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)**

\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%

&#x200B;

In this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio. I do know I'm not accounting for risk here but, being youngish, I am not too worried about it at this point. I also understand the 1 year growth is a bad marker of growth due to the COVID.

But, I can tell you how I got started and how I think through things.

When I started I found a mutual fund that was a target-date retirement fund. (I don't recommend buying these directly)

But you can pull up their data sheets and prospectus and see how they work. They just buy into 5 or 6 other mutual funds that each capture a part of the market (ie. Large-cap Growth, Large-cap Value, Mid-caps, Bonds, international markets).

You can see what they bought and usually they have some charts explaining how they shift over time towards bonds over time. They shift into bonds gradually mid to late career, probably a bit earlier than most people do on their own.  Some brokerage firms also have an ETF portfolio builder tool you could use for advise, just see what they do differently as you input different things into the portfolio builder.

T.Rowe Price has a fund that targets a 2060 retirement, 2055, 2050, 2045, 2040, 2035, 2030, 2025, etc.... So you can see how they shift into different categories as people get closer to retirement.

&#x200B;

A more complex answer.... Eventually you have to learn to split up your investments into different purposes and you will need to think about the risk of each purpose differently. You also have to think about the time until you need the money.

Emergency Cash: Need \~$20k  Risk:ultra-low  I keep it in a savings account. This is my car breaks down. my house needs a new A/C unit. I had a house fire (which I actually did in Jan 2020).  I lose my job. This is money that can't go down much when there is a recession/crash, I might need it if I also lost my job

Extended Emergency Cash / Extended job loss: Need $40k Risk: Low. This is money I want to invest somehow, but I want it to be less volatile so it won't lose as much in a crash.  I got into some Bond Funds and one low-volatility stock ETF that showed lower risk. 

If you're saving up to put a kid into college, a new car, a house down payment, you have to consider each of those separately and think about the risk relative to when you need the money. Can you put off buying a house for 5 years? for some the answer is yes and they can be a bit more flexible and aggressive at investing their down-payment. But if you're paying for college in a particular year, you can't delay for 5 years. You need that money that year. You have to be lower risk nearing college.

&#x200B;

Retirement.... Depending on how well you're saving up and how much you need, you can have different levels of risk. I'm not going to tell you how much you need for retirement. There are tons of articles and retirement calculators online. Use those to find out what you need at age 65. To use a clean number I'm just going to say $1 million as an example value for what you need to get from 65 to 95+ comfortably and stay in good health. Maybe you don't take many cruises, buy expensive watches, etc..., but you can keep your house, feed yourself, pay for healthcare, go out to eat once a week, keep a car, etc...

This is the essential amount you need to protect. If you're able to save up more and/or you're on course to save up beyond that amount by 65, you can be a bit more aggressive on the amounts that exceed this. This isn't money you depend on to get by, this is the money you use to buy a beach condo, a boat, an RV, go on a cruise 4x/year. If you had money you were planning on passing down to your children -and- you will not rely on it, then you can invest it aggressively as they would at a younger age.

That essential amount needed to live comfortably through retirement, which for many people is all of their investments, is what has to be protected. When you're 70, you can't make more money to throw in there easily. You can look at the S&P 500 charted out from 1927, until now. Look at every major crash and every recovery. 2008 took about 5 years for the market to recover. 2000 took about 8 years for the market to recover. 1987 took 2 years. There are a series of others just like these. The only one that was particularly bad for an extended period was the great Recession. It was 20+ years.

What goes through my mind is I need to be extreme in making sure I have 5 years worth of my retirement needs in a ultra-low risk thing. This is going to be treasury bonds, CDs, savings account. This will let you make it through most recoveries with your other investments untouched. A market crash isn't going to touch this.

Invest money you need 5-10 years out in items that are low risk, but maybe not ultra-low. Maybe more municipal bonds and some safer corporate bonds. That will pretty much last you through every past market recovery, except for something of the great depression scale.

Then for money you need 10-20 years out you can use more diversified bonds that have higher rates with some more risk and more low to moderate-risk dividend value stocks. You get more return, but there is time for this money to lose some in a recession and recover too.

Money you need beyond 20 years out,  that you have a little more room to invest in the general market and get average returns.

Even if your 65, at retirement, and there is a market crash, you still have money in relatively safe places to get you through the market recovery, while you have money you don't need for 20 years when your 85 in the market. You're planning to live another 30 years, hopefully.... maybe more. You just need to have enough money in safer places to weather that recovery.

I'd also consider these time lines before and after you start your retirement. I might be 50 and retirement is 15  years away, but the money I need in 15-20 years should be invested lower risk dividend stocks at that point. So I will start scaling money I need at age 65 into safer investments as I approach retirement.

&#x200B;

When you look at the target date retirement funds or work with a financial planner, they will set up something that is more simple that just says at this age X% bonds, Y% Dividend stocks Z% percent S&P 500, and then at this age.... a new set of percents. But those percents were created by someone scaling risks, relative to the time you need the money.

FYI, the reason I don't like target date funds, you can only sell the fund as one lump sum. You don't get to pick which parts of it you sell for cash at different ages. If there was a crash, I wouldn't want to sell the assets I think will recover. I'd sell the assets I had in a safe place.",,

Essentially, it is reducible to the matter of first and second-order responsibilities of the corporate sector and the political sphere respectively. The following speaks to a responsibility to stakeholders more broadly as well, but we'll keep it specifically to climate-related matters seeing as that's the topic.

First and second-order responsibilities roughly align with climate change mitigation and prevention in this instance. The first-order responsibility the corporate sector has to mitigate climate change is a two-fold necessity. Firstly, they aren't children and should not expect others to clean up their mess or prevent them from making mess. There's no reasonable way to deny the reality of climate change, and as a substantial contributor to it, the corporate sector has a responsibility to modify its behaviour to mitigate the damage it causes. There are obvious other issues as well, such as the corporate sector not adhering to law and regulations anyway - a good example for this discussion being the Volkswagen 'Dieselgate' scandal. But if it just being the right thing to do (and quite obviously so) is not compelling enough a reason, then a discussion of second-order responsibility, I hope, will be more fruitful.

What you say about it being a governmental responsibility is true. Specifically, I would say they have a second-order responsibility to prevent the corporate sector causing harm. However, it simply isn't that black and white an issue. As we saw with Dieselgate, imposing regulations is not always effective. If it were, then the matter would be much farther resolved than it currently is. But the issue with political responsibility is actually a lot more systemic. In the case of climate change mitigation and prevention, it's that it is a truly global issue, and the mechanics of multilateral climate governance (and maybe any sort of multilateral governance) are just too weak and ineffective as it stands.

This is a very complex matter involving notions of sovereignty and the rights thereof, self-determination of nations, and adherence to international law amongst other things. For example, treaties. As far as UN negotiations go, treaties are where the framework in international law for climate responsibility is set. The 2018 Paris Agreement, for instance. That enshrined into international law exactly the sort of political responsibility you speak of. However, all it takes is one regressive administration to decide they are being burdened unfairly and withdraw from the agreement, and the whole accord is jeopardised. Indeed that is what happened in 2018 when the US withdrew. I believe it was a similar reason that the US did not join the Kyoto Accord in the '90s, too. 

The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement represented a shirking of both its first and second-order governmental responsibility to climate change mitigation and prevention. But as well as that, the UN, as the body of multilateral governance, was unable to prevent the US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement because it facilitated unilateral withdrawal, and the correct procedure for withdrawal was followed. Although even if it wasn't, the most that could have be done would have been sanctions, and I doubt a that would have happened anyway. In essence, legally mandated regulations still require voluntary adherence, and this is problematic because it renders them subject to political whim.

The broader issue with multilateral climate governance and bodies like the UN is that it is stifled by too many considerations tangential to the matter at hand. It's an ethical quagmire to determine who has responsibility for what, and who should bear what portion of the cost for climate change mitigation and prevention. Should the cost be borne more by those who contribute the most to emissions, or should it be determined by who has the greatest ability to pay? What about those most vulnerable to climate change, shouldn't they have the loudest voice? Who gets to decide? What if nations are unwilling to contribute? What level of perceived harm or sacrifice are we willing to accept in climate change mitigation and prevention? Their second-order responsibility is barely even gotten to before other political issues arise. What's more, consider the political influence of transnational corporations. If a large transnational corporation domiciled in one nation is creating environmental issues in a second, host-nation, to which nation does the responsibility of enforcing regulation fall? There may be a strong intuition as to which, but arguing the case is never easy and resistance is always met. That matter is compounded by differing regulations between nations, as well as by the transnational corporations themselves sometimes having greater economic power than the host-nation itself. The host-nation may be unwilling or unable to enforce any regulation if doing so entails damaging their economic prosperity by having the transnational pull out. And so on. It's a mess.

To return to the corporate sector, the main reason in my view that it has a responsibility to climate mitigation, as well as stakeholder interests more broadly, is that is has the economic power, reach, and the overall logistical capacity to transcend the problems brought about by the shortcomings of multilateral and even just domestic governance. We saw an example of this when the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement, and the 'we are still in' movement emerged in corporate America.

Sorry, I'll translate that to dumbass: it's worth more than Tesla and amounts to about 1/2 of GOOGL or AMZN.

713,gzm7rnu,2021-05-27 09:07:24,t1_gzm7rnu,t3_nluvff,investing,"I work in data and analytics at a Media company and use Snowflake every day in my work.

I’m bullish on Snowflake because it is BY FAR, the best data warehousing product on the market by a mile. 

Most other data warehousing products out there cost a TON to use (look up teradata - they’ve struggled to grow revenue the past few years) - by cost a ton I’m meaning implementation fees alone can range in the millions of dollars, effectively locking anyone but the biggest of companies out from using their product.

Snowflake on the other hand is cheap. It’s not a SAAS product, you don’t pay subscription fees to use it. Instead, you purchase credits from snowflake (this is the $1.4B in future revenue that they already have booked), and consume these credits to run queries, import data etc into Snowflake. 

Using credits to do our day to day work explains why Snowflakes revenue retention rate is so high. Customers, like us, are constantly querying the data in our data warehouse to update business dashboards, pull reports etc. This data normally needs to be refreshed at least daily, if not multiple times a day. Every time a query is refreshed Snowflake makes money.

Given how easy it is to import data from a variety of sources, the number of business intelligence developers that we’ve employed has increased 5x because the business sees such value in a platform. No longer does it takes days or weeks to import data into Snowflake, you can have clean, transformed and ready to use data, pushing that into your business dashboards, in a matter of hours. As we move more reports away from being manual and done in excel to being automated and powered by Snowflake, our cost to use the product naturally increases over time.

The reason why I am bullish on Snowdlake is because there target market is SO LARGE. They have under 5000 customers WORLDWIDE, who use their product. For reference, the media company I work for is SMALL (i’m based in New Zealand), and we probably spend roughly 30k per year on Snowflake for all our data warehousing needs.

Think of mega cap companies, like Coca Cola, Walmart, Home Depot etc and think about the VOLUME of data that they have! Billions of rows of operational data that is ONLY INCREASING OVER TIME. Think of the number of disparate systems - CRM, accounting, billing, procurement etc, and think about the need for having this data in a place where analysts across a business can query one place for the business source of truth.

Think also about how the amount of data over time is only going to increase as become more of an interconnected world - IOT, more data being consumed over the internet, automated cars, robots - all are going to require that data to be stored somewhere and used at a later date - that’s what Snowflake does.

Literally, they could stop growing their customer numbers and their revenue would still grow 60%+ per year as their existing customers become more integrated with the warehouse and query it more and more.

From a technical perspective, sure they’re competing against the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google, but these products are SHIT compared to the godliness of Snowflake. Literally, the ability to query 320million rows of data in a query in Snowflake that takes 6 minutes to run vs 6 HOURS in Azure.

As a professional in the industry, I will not promote any product other than Snowflake to a future business that I work for if they don’t yet have a data warehouse. This is only going to amplify over time as the people using the product become the spokespeople for it - because Snowflake is THAT GOOD.

So yes, from an investment perspective, Snowflake is HELLA expensive. 60x TTM sales is ridiculous, regardless of the growth rate of the company. However, if you begin to consider the total number of customers that can use them (because their revenue is usage rather than subscription based, both large and small customers can easily use them -  no other product allows for this), the fact that data levels are only going to increase over time, and the fact that their product is clearly superior to everything else on the market, you can see why they are valued so richly.

TLDR: Snowflake user. Snowflake is dope asf. They have so many more people they can sell to and will see revenue growth rates for a long time to come. BUY",,

When William Mark decided to get back into investing after the 2008 financial crisis, he looked past stocks and bonds. Needing to play catch-up with his retirement portfolio, the piping engineer decided to bet on a complicated product he hoped would deliver double-digit annual returns.

It worked so well—earning him 18% a year in dividends, on average—that he eventually poured $800,000 into the investments, called leveraged exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he lost almost every penny.

“I’m 67 years old and I’m basically bankrupt in just two weeks,” Mr. Mark said. (https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bankrupt-in-just-two-weeks-individual-investors-get-burned-by-collapse-of-complex-securities/ar-BB14STeh?li=BBnb7Kz)",,

When I start adding up the bills with my internet expense, I pay a lot for access to content. I can't tell you the last time I watched something on Netflix. My kids use it but they also have Disney +. Being that their children, if Netflix suddenly stopped working they would find something else and one of the other streaming sites we pay for. So when I start going down the list of where can I cut, Netflix always takes the top spot. The only problem is I have other people who use my membership because they are leeches. At this point, the price of the subscription is not high enough in order for me to pull that trigger, but I'm on the edge there. If Netflix raises the price again I am probably not going to stay on. If Netflix suddenly needs to earn more fees because their subscription base flattens out or their content cost increase how many people will jump ship because a price increase those are justify the subscription of a service that is surpassed by other services in terms of use.",,

Stock futures are down a bit, with tech stocks leading the drop. Nasdaq off about 0.4%. S&P 500 about 0.2% lower. Dow Industrials down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a pretty quiet day on Wall Street, with some muted gains. Disappointing earnings from Nvidia and Snowflake after the bell appear to be weighing on sentiment now, especially for tech stocks. This is preventing a breakout.

Bunch of economic data releases this morning that people will be watching in anticipation of a Fed adjustment to interest rate policy.

These all drop at 0830: Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation. Core prices are expected to have increased by 2.3% in Q1, the same as in Q4. If that number beats the upside then watch out for inflation and tapering talk. 

Durable goods orders should shed some light on supply chain constraints as well as demand from manufacturers. Expectations are for 0.8% print for core orders, down from the 2.3% level in March. 

It’s Thursday, so we also get initial jobless claims. Economists are expecting another post-pandemic low there, of 425k. That’s a slight drop from 444k reported last week. 

There’s also a GDP print, but I don’t care about that as it’s entirely backward looking and has no impact on future direction of pretty much anything.

We also have pending home sales at 1000. Expectations there are for 0.8% increase, down from 1.9% in March.

Most people like only roughly 1% of TV and film content ever produced. Knowing this, the subjectivity of it, and the unimaginably varied taste humans have, logic dictates that the optimal strategy is to produce as much content as you possibly can, therein doing two main things:

1. You keep your subscribers subscribed because they’re always looking forward to new content (or sequels). 

2. You have the breadth of varied content and the more content the more things comprise that 1% of things people like.  

I also want to add that while I like things on the other streaming services and I’m a fan of all of them, this strategy has created the most good things on Netflix, by far. They also enjoy the best app design, and highest quality streaming. 

I only have a single complaint about Netflix and that is that they need to renew their originals for 1-2 more seasons on average. They also need to write an ending if they decide not to renew, rather than canceling. No one likes an ending that wasn’t written to be the ending.",,

Some of these articles make it sound like some tooth fairy is going to emerge from the ethos and steal all the capital you have in your account. As if your position is just going to permanently vaporize forever.

I have invested in some inverse leveraged ETFs, and their performance over the last however many years has been just fine. If I buy the ETF at a low market price, why would it not eventually go back up, as it has cyclically over the course of maybe 10 years or more?

Is there something going on that is going to take money out of my position and steal some of the shares I own? Is the ETF somehow withdrawing cash from my positions?

Or is the concern limited to the simple performance of the fund?

Whether im right idk its just a theory I came up with looking at the charts a week ago. I found it curious the in that right around the time BTC was starting to rally was right around the same time all the indexes started to have corrections similar to what we have been seeing this year and right as BTC topped off and fell off a cliff was right around the time the 2018 correction found a bottom. Seems like the same thing that happened over this week.

There are still some strong moves happening in smaller names, but they are looking more like basing patterns that need more time than true breakouts.

Toward the end of a consolidation in November last year the Nasdaq shot up to the top of the range in just two days. There was more volatility after that and a slow breakout, but the move set the stage for higher prices.

In February 2000 the Nasdaq reached it previous highs in four days. From there, it consolidated and broke out higher into a final bubble top.

Moves like these keep traders who couldn’t buy in before on the sidelines. It also makes people who bought late wary of a correction.

That's the worst investing argument ever. We don't have to wait and see, just look at defi tokens and the projects they're doing, and the cash flows they have.

>I think its a ""hot take"" to assume its the future of currency.

This is how I know you have *absolutely no clue* about crypto. None. You're talking about ""currency"". Meanwhile I'm telling you that defi has *billions* of dollars in productive activity. Lending, borrowing, yield farming, nfts, etc...

>99% of people aren't in it for the tech, they are in it for quick money

And I bet you can't name 99.9% of the companies in your index fund, or what their business model even is. This is not a good argument.

>once sentiment changes ut will go down down as it did in 2017

Nobody is arguing that crypto, or any investment, will continually go up. There are highs and lows. This is investing 101.

>you most likely missed the top already 

I'm not a market timer in traditional investing nor in crypto.

>I got out a week before the +50% drop bc it was obvious.

OK cool, ethereum and some defi tokens are 10 year investments for me. ETH dropped 60% last weekend and I bought more.

It's amusing that you use the word ""obvious"" yet you can't wrap your head around VISA and others using ethereum as their b2b settlement protocol.

What isn't obvious to you is the difference between money/finance and currency.

So far you've given no real argument against crypto other than ""it will go down"".",,

In a stock split, the number of shares is simply multiplied by whatever number and the share price is divided by that number. Those holding stock in the company would not lose money because their number of shares would be multiplied, so if you held 1 tesla share at 2000 before the stock split, you would get 5 at 400 because they did a 5:1 split. This boosted their share price since many people wanted to buy tesla and not many trading platforms allow for fractional shares. Plus, it is proven that we would rather hold a whole number of things rather than pieces or fractions. Hope this helps!",,
