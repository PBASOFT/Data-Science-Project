The amount of growth it had in 2020, specially after split and S&P inclusion, it was high time for a correction. A 33% correction after a 900% growth in one year is acceptable imo. 

NKLA on the other hand was a pure speculative bet mostly by people who thought they missed TSLA train and also by people that did not like Musk. However, after their 1st earning report and call it was almost clear that they had nothing for investors down the road.

Whoever did not get out that time suffered big loss and that's on them. Whoever bought after that they suffered loss and that's Their fault too. 

It will be unwise to compare TSLA with NKLA just because the stocks lost values in similar percentage.",,

If AMC drops below $8, you lose all intrinsic value. However your downside is capped at 30k. With the shares, you put up front an additional 30k in capital, get the same sort of profit profile, and if AMC drops below $8, you lose more than 30k.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

586,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

&#x200B;

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

Call is the type of option, meaning that the purchaser has the right (but not obligation) to purchase shares at $185, rather than $215.40.   If the stock price is at $185, OP is ‚Äúat the money‚Äù, anything over is ‚Äúin the money‚Äù, but an investor will only exercise if it‚Äôs in their best interest. 

2) No, OP doesn‚Äôt have to buy the contracts at the strike price. The downside is that OP is paying a fee for the writing of the option, which is the option premium price. Meaning, each share has a dollar amount attached to it (say, $2 per share) that the buyer needs to pay to the seller in order to reserve this right to purchase the shares at the strike price. This is why people who buy options only exercise when the market price is in the money rather than at the money: because in order to make a profit you need to also factor in the price you‚Äôre paying for the option premium ON TOP OF the price of the stock.

So as the other person said l, It reflects stock price and implied volatility. So an increase in premium for a certain percentage OTM only reflects an increase in uncertainty of the future movement of the underlying asset.

Keep in mind call-put parity. The extrinsic value of an ITM call is essentially equal to that of the extrinsic value of the OTM out at the same strike(its whole value). Meaning, if the extrinsic value of the OTM puts are increased, bearish, that means the extrinsic value of the ITM calls are also equally increasing, bullish. Hence, they offset and can‚Äôt be used to determine direction.

Tesla died down when a lot of retards were wiped out after battery day and Elon stopped commenting here. AMC has always been somewhat suppressed, but GME was really supressed when the thread was removed and people were invited to leave. That also wiped hundreds of thousands of daily active users and polarized further the sub.

‚ÄúBecause Vimeo is that commercial-free, its videos are allowed on ad-supported outlets like Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter. Being Ad-free is also vital for distribution on online retailers like Amazon, Etsy and Shopify. And Vimeo‚Äôs corporate clients don‚Äôt have to fret about random advertisements‚Äîor, worse, ones from competitors‚Äîappearing in the middle of their branded content. 

Companies like Deloitte, Pottery Barn, Rite Aid and Forbes use Vimeo to deliver training and onboarding videos in addition to livestreaming corporate events to employees now spread worldwide. Meanwhile, a million-plus smaller businesses use Vimeo to distribute advertising, product demos and how-to videos. Vimeo may have failed to launch its own streaming channel, but thousands of others‚Äîfrom indie filmmakers to Pilates instructors‚Äîuse it to create subscription channels on streaming services such as Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV and Xbox.",,

What I mean is ""if you are assuming shit goes sideways and the report is going to be bad"" -> thus stock will tank -> therefore buy puts ahead of time to profit from that.

Only problem is that in the run up to earnings, IV will be going up due to uncertainty, so the price of the puts will be going up too. 

So even if you're correct and the earnings are garbage and the stock drops, IV will tank too because the uncertainty is resolved, so the price of the puts will be negatively impacted because of vega.

So what is the best time to buy to minimize IV crush (which is something calls get equally fucked by too, if you happen to believe the report will be good and the stock will go up)",,

I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

1473,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Yes, it‚Äôs the exact opposite with puts, in fact puts are the reason why GME has exploded in the first place. The hedge funds performed a strategy thats called a ‚Äúnaked call‚Äù, meaning they sold call options to buyers and made money off the premiums (for every call option there is a buyer and a seller, and the amount that the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù makes directly correlates with the amount the ‚Äúloser‚Äù loses). The difference here though, is that they don‚Äôt actually own the stocks that they are selling, so if the price goes up, the buyers of these call options can do what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmargin call‚Äù to get their shares, which forces the writer of the option (the hedge funds) to purchase the stocks in order to fulfill the contracts. This puts buying pressure on the stock which raises the price, putting more options in the money and thus creating a positive feedback loop called the ‚Äúgamma squeeze‚Äù.",,

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

1638,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Before Gamestop you can find articles such as linked at the bottom here that point out that hedge funds overall don't do very well. In other words if they have all this special access that gives them a leg up to beat the market, it is not working very well.

Oh, as to shorting a stock over 100%, it is perfectly legal, you just don't understand how shorting works. It is just crazy risky as it sets up a short squeeze because it makes it easier for someone to buy over enough of the float that covering becomes very difficult.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

1778,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

Valuations, PE ratios, and market cap will sooner or later matter. No one will pay $500k for quarter or a million for a popsicle stick, because those things are easily valued by laymen (we know a quarter is about $0.25 and a popsicle stick is maybe $2)

A 600PE ratio like Tesla means it'll take 600 years of revenue of break even.
A non existent PE ratio like amc means they spend more money than they make right now.

Some companies honestly deserve to be bankrupt. Their CEOs are still taking in million dollar paychecks and pay their workers minimum wage.

AMC and some companies are like a lemonade stand that costs $25/yr to run but only sells $5 worth of lemonade per year, and for some reason you the neighbor is willing to buy it for $35. Oh and the stand owes $100 of debt, so you gotta pay that off once you buy the lemonade stand from the original owner.

Disclaimer: I just like the stock 


PS: I truly hope I will be able to truly communicate how beautiful the impact of just liking a stock can have on the greatest 180 in history?! We are the whale we thought we needed.

Hi! Thank you for reading this far! Thank you for trusting me on the promise of helping you to grow a wrinkle with a 50-50 mix of jacked titius and confirmation bias DNA. I don't really know how anything in the real world work tho. So you are a ape who likes a certain stock? Welcome to the 300k strong home where research of this stock is debated. DDs on how it might act in the future. A common thesis on this sub has been that there have been some fuckery on the stock market and somehow more shares than actually exists have been sold. But being the dumb money irrational retail investor that you are you might or might not now that the stock market is a zero sum game. One might now that the person selling the stock believes that the value of the stock is equal to the price they sell it for. While the buyer believes that the price of the stock is will actually be greater in the future. Meaning that this ape can get this stock at a discount.


This ape might have exchanged a share of his life for some bananas. Exchanging his time, knowledge and skills and transforming that into bananas that he can spend on things this ape like. This is economics 101. The average ape thinking like this might decide that he is willing to bet on average $100 on this outcome a month. A few people here might earn way more than others. But if you are living paycheck to paycheck the rewards should be proportional to your cost of living either way. This ape might also be so wrinkly and wise that he knows that infact this investment isn't into a dying brick and mortar store. Despite what the MSM have been preaching for the last few months. Because dumb retail investors have not access to the resources that smart money have. Because smart money believes that this stock is actually overvalued and should go down. They believe it so much that they might infact be betting more than they what they have on hand on it every day. The dumb ape might infact have some more bananas over for leisure spending at the end of each month. Being such a dumb ape he knows from Warren Buffet that spending money on a product you are a shareholder in isn't market manipulation and does infact might give a boost to the companies earnings number. And infact the average ape might reward him or herself with 20 dollars of spending at his new favourite store. Many apes don't have access to this store at the moment but lets say that the average wise ape have the brain wrinkle count that when he/she wants a gopro, instead of buying it at another store he can just order it from his favourite store. This ape gets super excited when he sees his item being delivered faster than any other place while also knowing deep inside his/her head that at the absolute minimum 5% of this banana spent goes to the pocket of the company he is a owner of. That is adding 5% to the bottom line of a company this ape is a proud owner off. This dumb ape knows if more and more people starts agreeing that this business isn't in fact dying but it's actually growing at an insane pace. Which this dumb ape knows would only add to the demand of his golden tickets. With his basic understanding of supply and demand for a finite product. He thinks that this only makes the odds of his bet paying off.
300k apes that likes the stock enough to spend 100$ a month that the price goes up is 360m money betting that the price goes up. 
It is also 6m spent in his favourite store which is 300k in pure profit in the store he believes will grow in the future. That 300k isn't wasted but is used to find more items and ways to turn a profit for gamestop. The average ape might like his investment strategy that he explains his reasoning and the amazing service to 0.1 of his/hers ape buddy. That is 30k more people that decides that 100$ on this investment seems wise. And soon all the people might realise that this is actually a gold nugget in the making and it might actually be a wise investment decision after all. Making this a self fulfilling prophecy. It was even written in the sky tonight. A bloody full moon what more confirmation bias do you need.

360m might not be seen as a lot but I'm really doing some bare bone calculations here and that is 1.8m shares being locked up a year at 200$ a share. That is 20% of a Ryan Coan or 2.5% of the total amount of shares in existence. Every day that goes by more and more people will see that this might actually not be a bad investment. I evolved from an X holder in January to a XX holder now and when Gamestop opens back up in my country I will for sure spend my bananas there. How many people are there actually out there with the same belief than me?


Thank you for reading! My tits are for sure jacked and my hands are made out of diamonds. The educational value here has for sure made my smooth brain turn a little more wrinkly so I will always consider myself in the green. I might even decide to retire some of the shares I've bought since I know the extra wrinkles on my smooth brain will give me ROI for life. Which might raise the floor for some less fortunate souls. How much money does people actually spend for education? A share seems like fine tuition",nlbewk,Power to the players!

I also spent a year in architecture school and after looking at career opportunities, potential earnings and the amount of debt I'd graduate with, I decided to get a degree worth something and changed majors.


Did I give up on my dreams? No. I bet a majority of architecture students just have the dream of designing their own home. So I got a degree in CompSci (well, the easier one, which was Computational Informatics) and busted my ass and taught myself employable languages so I could graduate and start a high earning career 


Now, I'm not saying student loans are perfect the way they are, quite the contrary. Realistically what should happen, is fixed interest rates (c'mon, no company should be making 10% off student loans), not a full on forgiveness.


If student loans were forgiven, that would be horrible. Colleges and lenders would jack up their prices because, hey, in 5-10 years maybe YOUR student loans will be forgiven too!",,

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

&#x200B;

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

China announced it will curb the ""unreasonable price"", which led to a decline in the past week after hitting all time highs seen in 2011.

ALOT of investors suggests a higher demand for copper in the next ten years as the economy and infrastructure transforms into eco-friendly systems. For example, an electric car needs 11x more copper than a one powered with fuel.

Nonetheless, is the percentage used for green-technology a noticeable portion of copper usage? China, the highest spender of Copper by volume, uses the majority of its copper for construction. Some organizations are claiming a housing bubble in China. This would lead to a sharp decline in demand if the bubble bursts the next few years. 

The majority of copper production healed from the pandemic. So there's no supply shortage. Nonetheless, the demand is expected to increase in the next few months as industries haven't yet fully recovered. I searched for materials online about the copper inventories state, but unfortunately with no luck. Can anyone give insights? 

Is Copper currently overpriced? What's your prediction for the next week? And as a long-term investment?",nlbiei,Copper as a long-term investment.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

Lo que importa es conseguir entrar en un strike que puede caber alguna o varias veces en la diferencia entre el precio actual y un precio objetivo a un plazo determinado.

Yo comprar√≠a el 17 de Junio de 2022, si entras en 3‚Ç¨ y toca los 4‚Ç¨ pr√°cticamente doblarias, si toca los 4,5 casi triplicas.

Si compras 4‚Ç¨, cuesta 0,15 pero a menos que toque los 4,30‚Ç¨ no doblas.

Al final es una cuesti√≥n de probabilidad, riesgo y beneficio.

Yo prefiero sacrificar algo de beneficio por probabilidad, esto es porque si aciertas m√°s frecuentemente puedes repetir el proceso y la rentabilidad se multiplica m√°s que con un suceso menos frecuente.

Figurate, puedes multiplicar 1,3 veces tu capital con un movimiento de un +3% si compras una CALL a un a√±o con un spread ajustado y se mueve ese? 3% en menos de un mes.

Si est√°s en una acci√≥n que aparentemente se mueve lateralmente, es posible capturar ese movimiento 4 o 5 veces en un a√±o.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

üçå Worth $30

üôä thinks üçå is going to be more expensive soon and buys a call option from üçå merchant for $25 (the price of the contract, called 'premium'), which allows üôä to buy 100 üçås at a later date for $30 dollars each, but he doesn't have to buy the bananas if he doesn't want to.

Scenario 1:

Volcano erupts, üçåüéÑ wiped out, üçå Price goes üöÄüåô and üôä decides to exercise his option to buy 100 üçå for $30 dollars each, and then sells them for $100 each making 70*100-25 ($6975 for you retards who can't math).

Scenario 2:

Volcano is üìÑüëê bitch and doesn't explode. üçå price stays the same. üôä Decides the option is not worth calling and is out of the 25 bucks he gave to üçå merchant.


Puts:

üçå Worth $30

üôä thinks üçå is going to be cheaper soon and buys a put option for $25 (the price of the contract, called 'premium'), which allows üôä to sell 100 üçås at a later date for $30 dollars each, but he doesn't have to sell the bananas if he doesn't want to.

Scenario 1:

Volcano erupts, üçåüéÑ wiped out, üçå Price goes üöÄüåô and üôä can't exercise his put option so it expires worthless. He loses the $25 bucks he paid for premium. 

Scenario 2:

üçåüéÑ are planted on a super fertile soil and provide absolutely insane amount of üçås.  üçå price tanks to $10 and üôä can:

1) üôä already owns 100 üçås, and exercises his puts, thus selling 100 üçå for $30 bucks each even though the price is already down to $10. This is called a 'protective put'. üôä didn't make any profit, but he didn't lose anything either (except the $25 premium). This is good to hedge your investment in case it tanks.

2) üôä owns 0 üçås, but buys 100 üçås at $10 each. He then exercises his put option, and sells them for $30 each, making a nice profit (($30-$10) x 100 - $25 = $1975)",,

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

>

There is no ‚Äúpotentially infinite loss‚Äù unless you are really, really, (and I mean, really) retarded, such as shorting something like a 0.30 dollar Biotech penny stock and then it discover the cure for cancer or some shit like that. This actually happened when that guy Martin Schkreli bought a penny biotech on the verge of bankruptcy and went from 0.10 to like 8 dollars, but again, people who short that kind of stuff are waiting for a catastrophe to happen. 

I always, routinely short ‚Äúnormal‚Äù stocks because it‚Äôs actually much safer to be hedged (so I long X finance stock and short another Y finance stock). This way I‚Äôm market neutral and I don‚Äôt care if everything goes to shit, which actually reduces my risk. 

There‚Äôs also a thing called ‚Äústop losses‚Äù, which I know many of you here don‚Äôt even know what they are, but you always use stop losses when shorting, as easy as that. Many times my short has gone south (it‚Äôs a normal part of trading, even a 55% winrate is pretty decent for example) and I just take my loss. Unless there is an extreme squeeze event (such as Volkswagen or something crazy like that), you always get filled close to the SL price.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

This is not the next Amazon,  but it's underevaluated for what it is 50 YoY growth (market cap 5B   for  3.8B re. 1.8B cash flow  and no debts)  
That's why  average target analysts is about 24$

Still they have to figure out how to get profit from the growth in RE,

IF they do, it will easlly be a 30B market cap.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

Roblox for example targets a niche demographic and functions as essentially an interface and platform for people to make their own creations that can be run in instanced ways. No matter how innovative the ""game"" created on the platform, these ""games"" will always be constrained by the limits of the platform. As a result any ""game"" that becomes successful enough and is growing will depart the platform to become its own standalone title, for example unturned.

Thats the main issue here. Platforms such as Linden Lab's Second Life does and has everything Roblox has, while also doing far far more and has true persistence as an internet of virtual spaces in a true sense rather than instances of creations you load or join. Second Life also has a thriving creator economy and virtual real estate turning over thousands of dollars per day for creators. Second Life on top of this targets all demographics by being a web protocol rather than a platform for content. 

Despite all of this, Second Life remains neutral in its growth and even slightly negative in growth and while profitable sees little to no growth. 

So if competitors to Roblox are doing more than roblox and despite this are not seeing growth in value, how is roblox going to be different despite doing less and targeting an even smaller demographic?",,

I think the most recent indicator though, was price going up when 13Fs came out. Made no sense at the time, but I guess big money ended being super bullish on retail ownership. At a minimum of 20% SI and 50% institutional ownership, retail holds minimum of 50M shares. It's like TSLA on crack.",,

4980,,2021-05-25 17:28:55,t3_nkv7q2,,wallstreetbets,"Something interesting happened today. Vimeo, the video hosting service that is 100x better than YouTube but still nobody knows about (except losers like me) just had it's IPO today and it got fucked!

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

4984,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4di35esjtb171.png?width=2177&format=png&auto=webp&s=822146cd7f5af19db4410aeae6646557bd864cd9

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Ford‚Äôs plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
5017,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
5018,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

5019,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

5447,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
5448,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
5449,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

5450,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

| On May 25, 2021, Academy reduced its term loan obligation by $99 million, leaving an outstanding principal balance of $300 million, and lowered the interest rate on the remaining balance by 125 basis points to LIBOR + 3.75%. This new rate will save the Company approximately $9 million in interest expense on an annualized basis.‚Äù

Works out to about 0.09 per share. At a 10x P/E, That should add 0.90 to the share valuation.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

In the first quarter, it sold 73,000 houses, while Zillow and Opendoor sold fewer than 5,000 combined. But eXp World reports a smaller revenue number because, for it, that metric doesn't represent the sales value of the houses. (Because of an accounting quirk, Opendoor and Zillow report all the houses sold as revenue to the company).""

Zillow currently has a market cap of 27b. While EXPI has a market cap of 4.22b at the time of this writing. While EXPI is doing 14.6 times the amount of selling that Zillow is it has a market cap that is 6.75 times less than Zillow. That means the EXPI could easily move up 6 times what it is trading at now.

28x6=$168 per share.

EXPI also just increased their share buyback program from 75m to 475m. Which means they could buy a ton of stock and are probably going to announce a share buyback. Sending the already 54% insider owned stock absolutely skyrocketing due to them not selling the stock and supply running short.

They also are expanding into other countries right now and are on pace to be the largest worldwide real estate company.

>What could be ‚Äúthe biggest crash ever,‚Äù he argues, will hit by the end of June, if not sooner. It will be ‚Äúthe initiation of the next big economic downturn,‚Äù Dent predicts.

>‚ÄúFake earnings, fake GDP, fake interest rates and super-high valuations‚Äù make for an increasingly untenable situation, he warns. The expanding market bubble has been building since 2008. But the Federal Reserve keeps averting the next huge crisis by continuously ‚Äúprinting money,‚Äù declares the Harvard Business School MBA.

>His HSD Publishing, an independent research firm, generates monthly newsletters that he and Rodney Johnson, HSD president, each write.¬†

>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs better than sleeping with 30-year Treasury bonds,‚Äù he exults. They‚Äôll ‚Äúmagnify your money.‚Äù He then describes a portfolio allocation for the investor that‚Äôs ‚Äúwilling to take more risk.‚Äù As for the notion of high inflation, ‚Äúno way in hell,‚Äù he says.

Not sure what to feel about this, especially when there are lot of big players saying the same.

5661,,2021-05-25 16:18:02,t3_nktkfy,,wallstreetbets,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Tilray's merger with Aphria paved the way for creating the world's largest cannabis company (by revenue). After checking out a lot about TLRY i was buying 1.170 Tilray-stocks today.

So how are people going to try to cut cost of building homes? Are they going to look for traditional alternatives to cut down on cost like brick/stucco/hardie/vinyl instead of a wood based exterior, tile instead of wood floors, etc. ??? Or is there other materials that can be used? I know we will still be using wood for most construction. At this time, lumber it is still the most cost efficient but who is to say someone doesn't discover a more cost efficient way. Personally I see brick being used more in new construction on single family homes.

5665,,2021-05-25 17:28:55,t3_nkv7q2,,wallstreetbets,"Something interesting happened today. Vimeo, the video hosting service that is 100x better than YouTube but still nobody knows about (except losers like me) just had it's IPO today and it got fucked!

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

We can do this same thing with other companies.

CVS stock would be worth $3960. 

Walmart stock would be worth $8430.

I hope this gives a little perspective into how crazy the tiny number of gamestop shares impacts this play.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Zillow currently has a market cap of 27b. While EXPI has a market cap of 4.22b at the time of this writing. While EXPI is doing 14.6 times the amount of selling that Zillow is it has a market cap that is 6.75 times less than Zillow.

EXPI also just increased their share buyback program from 75m to 475m. Which means they could buy a ton of stock and are probably going to announce a share buyback. Sending the already 54% insider owned stock absolutely skyrocketing due to them not selling the stock and supply running short.

They also are expanding into other countries right now and are on pace to be the largest worldwide real estate company.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

So how are people going to try to cut cost of building homes? Are they going to look for traditional alternatives to cut down on cost like brick/stucco/hardie/vinyl instead of a wood based exterior, tile instead of wood floors, etc. ??? Or is there other materials that can be used? I know we will still be using wood for most construction. At this time, lumber it is still the most cost efficient but who is to say someone doesn't discover a more cost efficient way. Personally I see brick being used more in new construction on single family homes.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

5900,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

5932,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
5933,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
5934,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

5935,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
6385,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
6386,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

6387,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

""Doing research your own research"" has got to be near the top of the 2020-2021's ""shit uninformed people say"" list. 

Doing your own research SHOULD be a relatively respectable statement to make, but in reality what ""doing your own research"" typically entails is looking up someone else's research that is dumbed down and presented in a slightly entertaining way to give your brain a feeling of productivity and entertainment. The big picture of this is everyone is sourcing each other, using each others ideas, and feedback looping information and the use of that information.

WHICH WOULD BE FINE IF THIS SOMEONE WAS RIGHT.

But in almost every instance, they're not.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

7339,,2021-05-25 16:18:02,t3_nktkfy,,wallstreetbets,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

7347,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices. So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",nky421,Here‚Äôs some DD that WSB had been lacking

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in.",nkza6a,$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.

In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

7379,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
7380,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
7381,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

7382,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

| On May 25, 2021, Academy reduced its term loan obligation by $99 million, leaving an outstanding principal balance of $300 million, and lowered the interest rate on the remaining balance by 125 basis points to LIBOR + 3.75%. This new rate will save the Company approximately $9 million in interest expense on an annualized basis.‚Äù

Works out to about 0.09 per share. At a 10x P/E, That should add 0.90 to the share valuation.

Few weeks ago when they talked about the dillution they were saying amc will not dillute it and all, then amc dilluted and they just changed the narrative to ""its all for the best we stronger than ever""

So basically amc is a cult without reason. The only legit reason they can provide is that post covid people will go to theaters ... It doesnt justify a climb in prices with the last year and the previous ones that were a downhill fall but with crazy support you can expect crazy reactions. I know its going down as a business model but i decided to ride along with the cultists.

It is expensive to make and hold stock of raw materials if you can‚Äôt sell them, it‚Äôs not free to use a warehouse or even guarantee that your materials aren‚Äôt ruined in storage. The cost of transportation increasing would not be because of an increase in wages, again several of those costs are associated with months of shutdown. The idea that rising wages causes supply of a good to decrease is not consistent with intertemporal models, especially in the long run. Additionally the wage increase has not been across the board for everyone in the economy. The supply chain disruption is in chips (leading to car price increases) that are primarily made in China and some other parts of Asia (I don‚Äôt believe they have had a significant wage increase, please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong not trying to be sarcastic I really don‚Äôt know). 

Please look at the median inflation not the average and then compare it to the price deflator. There is a reason economist have multiple tools to measure the relative price of things. The CPI is a great tool but it is not the end all be all and it has a tendency to overstate in its own way. (I know price deflator has its downfalls too). But comparing them will generally let you know if your off base when one has ‚Äúflashing lights‚Äù

If there were a wage increase as you hypothesized than inflation is negating that to where the wage increase is offset by the price of the goods and there is no real change only nominal. Compare the nominal wage increase data that you have to the nominal inflation rate and see what the real difference is and if you believe that number is extreme enough to classify as runaway inflation.

The last thing is this, inflation isn‚Äôt bad. Especially when macro growth has been centralized and over stated by gig economy workers since the last recession. We need inflation and have always had it, if we don‚Äôt it means we aren‚Äôt growing as an economy. It also makes it relatively cheaper to pay back personal debt, which is something that burdens almost everyone that had a ‚Äúwage increase‚Äù 

You also forgot to mention that whole wage increase was going on the central bank was buying bonds of companies at a rate and risk they never had before. I guess my main point is inflation is a tool to use but doesn‚Äôt control everything. There is a lot more going on than just inflation going up so the stock market moves. You gotta dig deeper

This is all my opinion and you can tell me to F off, one love.",,

However I do not buy your premise at all. Catastrophes like pandemics and market corrections really don't affect the wealthiest peoples day to day lives, and at ticket prices anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000 for a couple hours experience who is Branson target audience?

If Travis Barker, Joe Rogan, Neil Degrasse Tyson, or Bill Ney the Science Guy want to go to fucking space; the tail end of a pandemic and a market correction are going to be totally irrelevant. The real limitation is Virgin's abilities to actually be able to do it, but once Branson goes the real limiting factor will be their turn around ability of how often they can do it, and mechanical repairs.

Also even if your point WAS valid, they ALREADY have 600 tickets sold and a huge waiting list. SO even if the pandemic worsens and a Q3 or Q4 market correction took place, they already have their first 600 passengers ready to go. Ideally their goal is 400 flights a year, and at the very start of the project that is obviously going to be much slower, turn around. So its not a stretch to assume that is 2 years of passengers already ready paid and agreed to go, decisions been made market forces or pandemics be damned.

I agree between now and the announcement of the Branson flight, their price will decrease gradually from where it is now. But the minute Branson's confirmed to fly, (Q4 I think) as long as their aren't any accidents this rocket will at minimum 3x and not come back for a long time.",,

He also pushed real hard for FSD Beta to be available widely and then had to walk it back.
Plus, just go look at youtube videos of people testing the FSD beta in suburban and urban areas, especially unprotected left turns where it always wants to wait during a gap and T-bone the next car or pull out directly in front of it...  not to mention the times it misunderstands speed limits or tries to drive where there is no road when it gets confused.

Elon is good at overstating shit and then hoping it plays out, but I think his luck there might be running out...  just look at how the Boring tunnel went from cool carts that zip around your car autonomously to an underwhelming and claustrophobic tunnel with trained taxi drivers.",,

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
8673,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

&#x200B;

8674,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

You've missed my point. DYOR is a tagline often spouted by people who have done nothing but ""do your own confirmation bias"". 

> clearly, you can go on youtube and see other people‚Äôs work but you can also look at the charts on your own

Lmao you're proving my point for me. Watching a video on YouTube of someone's charts? Do you think this counts as research? Do you have a understanding of why certain chart patterns look a certain way to begin with? Like the actual underlying auction theory reasons? Have you read into how HFT's have changed the way patterns form in charts, such as option greeks and MM hedging obligations have changed the way patterns are seen on screen? 

Watching someone elses video without doing anything else appears to be your qualifier for ""not researching, but watching"" but your qualifier for turning that into ""researching"" is simply...looking at the charts yourself and checking in on a couple of articles? This is the feedback loop I mentioned earlier. 

**You haven't once suggested looking into the actual academia, and I'm not talking about quant-tier math PHD shit.** I'm talking like trading 101 shit like Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg. I'm talking about reading like maybe 1 whole book.

Options contracts allow you to either sell or purchase 100 shares per contract of an equity at a particular strike price on or before the expiry date.
  
Owning a call contract allows you to purchase 100 shares of the underlying strike price.  
Writing (selling, net negative contract ownership) a call contract obligates you to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  
  
Owning a put contract allows you to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  
Writing (selling, net negative contract ownership) a put contract obligates you to purchase 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  
  
Purchasing a contract costs a premium per share. Writing a contract means someone else is paying you a premium per share for the contract you are writing.  
  
If a contract expires out of the money, then the contract has no value. The writer of the contract in this case profits the premium for which it was initially sold. The purchaser of the contract has a loss of the premium for which it was initially purchased.  
  
The current value of a contract is related to the statistical likelihood of the contract being ITM by expiry. The more unlikely, the cheaper the contract (e.g. a SPY $500 call that expires tomorrow when the current price of SPY is $420).  
  
When looking at options contracts, your primary factors in price changes are Theta (change in value over time), Delta (change in value by price), and Vega (change in value by volatility).  
  
For purchased calls, Theta is negative (you lose money as time passes because there is less time for the stock to go ITM/further ITM), Delta is positive (as the price of the underlying increases, the contract value increases by the Delta amount), and Vega is positive (as the measure of volatility of the stock increases, the contract value increases by the Vega amount). These values are not static and change over time (which is represented by the other greek values).  
  
You can generate profit off of options without the underlying ever going ITM. For instance, you have likely seen posts of people profiting off of GME with $800 strike calls, even though GME has to date never closed above $500. This is because both the stock underwent huge changes in price and volatility, which means the contract increased via delta and vega proportionally.",,

It also won't be fooled by optical illusions like light glares and shadows (anyone see the video of a Tesla randomly cutting over lanes bc the camera saw a pattern of sunlight caused by shadows that looked like lane dashes?)

Lidar, radar, cameras, ultrasonic - each sensor type has it's limitations and advantages.  Sensor fusion is the process of combining that data to get more reliable probabilities of the real world.  You don't need them all, but relying solely on cameras seems like a step backwards. 

But, ya know... do your own research:

Roblox will \*not\* fail, but it is \*not\* going to be an avenue for future growth.

The concept is sound, but for context Roblox is far less developed and is far narrower in scope than other things that have done this.

For a comparison, Roblox is essentially ""Youtube Kids"" in metaverse. We don't consider YouTube Kids something new and innovative, just like Roblox isn't.

Likewise, Youtube has content that targets younger demographics, as does Youtube Kids. But YouTube Kids is \*only\* that demographic.

Roblox will be profitable, what it will not be is a growth stock. However, this is a concept that \*will\* be a growth stock from something else that tries this, without the hamstringing Roblox has put on itself.

As mentioned, the problem that exists with these platforms is they are based on their foundation codebase and engine tech and firmly stuck to it. Any porting to future engines either is limited by partial implementation to preserve legacy content, or a total abandonment of legacy content which leads to user disenfranchisement.",,

AMC is currently trading at a $9000mm market cap... prepandemic levels placed this at $600mm.

AMC has had **no bullish news** for **years**.

The stock is relying *entirely on buy pressure that is detached from the company's actual value.* This **only works in tech companies, because you're investing in the technology and market ownership**.

AMC has **no room to grow in the cinema industry in the USA**. 

AMC has diluted shares from 50m to 500m... raising **billions of dollars**. They **still have debt**.

So why is GME better? Because it *doesn't need a squeeze.* It has more investors, despite what forum sliders want you to believe. It has institutional investors, because of the fundamental value proposition posed by Ryan Cohen and the team they're building.

The company has 99% market share to grow into, and an exploding technological industry to take advantage of. Theyre rapidly and radically transforming their product offerings and their delivery models.

The stock is still undervalue.

If RC had launched a startup with the same vision that Gamestop has... it would be valued *more than Gamestop currently is* at its IPO.

Gamestop has an established customer base, that is now expanding into Europe.

Wake up guys.

AMC isn't it. It never was. It never will be. They aren't working with Gamestop.

Gamestop is safe on its own strengths. It doesn't need a squeeze. It will continue to grow overtime regardless.",,
