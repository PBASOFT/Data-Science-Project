I am a college student currently writing my bachelorthesis on hedge fund replication. 

Unfortunately my university does not poses a bloombergterminal so I have to use Reuters. For some reason the Barclay, BofA and Citi bond index families are not included.

Has anyone here got an idea where I could get them in high quality or with what I could substitute them?

I love to code, I think I'm pretty good at it. I do it professionally as well. Algotrading attracted me because of potential upside, maybe working for yourself someday. Because myself like many others here, at the end of day would just like to make some money.

I've realized though, I just don't love learning about markets. I don't love studying charts, it just isn't for me. I like building systems/improving them/ debugging them/watching them work. Unfortunately that is obviously much less valuable as anyone can do it. I remember a relatively heavily upvoted post of a guy (claiming obviously) that too many of us in here just want to code, and don't really want to trade. Not sure who true that is, but I could see that being possible

Those of you who find/found yourself in my shoes, what did you do? Did you focus on other things besides algotrading? Did you focus on particular parts of algotrading? Did you go into building tools?

It seems reasonable me that it would happen on smaller timescales, since there are thousands of trading bots self adjusting to live orders coming in.

However, I would think that it would happen to less of a degree on timescales greater than daily / weekly candles, since orders from individual traders much more easily fly under the radar, aggregated with the day's / week's volume.

I've already written down the pseudocode for my strategy and all that's left to actually write the damn thing around whichever trading site I decide on. 
I've heard good things about Coinbase given that it has pretty good open source and a wide variety of cryptos to choose from. I've also heard that Coinbase Pro is specifically really good for algotrading

My question has to do with the rates, I've tried looking online but I can't seem to get a straight answer, I can adjust my code to account for fees and I'm hoping that it at least gives profit the majority of the time

What are the rates and fees for Coinbase Pro? After all is said and done how much can I expect to lose each time I buy and sell? 

Let's say I'm starting with $1,000 in my wallet and trading in increments of $250, how much loss do I have to account for? (Percentage and flat fees)

Alternatively, if there are other options that you think are better than Coinbase Pro I'm all ears! I also toyed with the idea of having my own wallet and, if possible, buying and selling crypto without having to deal with third party fees but I've only ever traded through a third party before so I have no idea about the logistics of that but if it's worth it, I'm willing to put in the extra work and learn.

In a crisis, large fund flows dominate the entire market. But it also seems like the market largely moves in tandem on a daily basis, as if the market is constantly repricing macro variables that result in bid/ask prices moving higher or lower ""across the board"", but this kind of seems weird to me outside of short-term financial crises. Why should everything move so closely together? It just seems irrational.

Hoping for a good explanation of why this is the case so I can understand it.

For instance, large institutions might decide to de-risk and sell off large ETF holdings affecting mostly S&P 500 stocks. I guess it then makes sense that all the stocks inside those ETFs might get knocked down a bit. But why should that also affect surrounding stocks, and even stocks in other geographies?

I have been searching around for an affordable real time API for stocks prices. The Finhub free API has what I'm looking for (60 calls per minute is OK for me) but it's only for the US markets and I want for international, or at least for Europe.

I am just starting out that's why I'm looking for something affordable at say max 50-100 USD per month. The real time accuracy does not need to be super great, it's enough if it's somewhat accurate on a per minute basis.

I've been searching a lot but I really struggle to find something affordable for Europe that is real time and not with 15 minutes delay etc.

If I can't find any I will consider web scraping, but I would like to avoid it since I want to get prices for many stocks at the same time. I reckon that if I scrape a website for say 60 stocks per minute they will block me or at least limit my connection a lot).

12,2021-05-11 17:19:16,t3_na27ox,na27ox,algotrading,"I recently built an efficient frontier app that is built on python and hosted on my github. App [here](https://share.streamlit.io/diegodalvarez/streamlit_efficient_frontier/efficient_frontier_streamlit_base.py). 

But sometimes I would run it an get a plot that would look something like this

https://preview.redd.it/lkfv57yutey61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54a0635e1b0c80de79d5a45e6fec964bcd13dc6

I thought it was interesting that I would get this shape with outlier points when I am used to this shape

So I started looking into the problem and my first assumption was the number of tickers. The first test was around 30 stocks and the second test  was 6 stocks. Each used the same calculation method 10y of daily historical adjusted close data using mean returns and covariance with 100,000 simulations. I then built a function in python that drops tickers and then runs the efficient frontier and this is what the results look like. 

https://preview.redd.it/idwa0dmxtey61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0046bb4a209de931b8aafeb2816ce1e3050d86a7

The way that this function works is that it pulls stocks from S&P 500 and then it drops a random amount of tickers then runs the efficient frontier over and over. It uses 10y of historical  adjusted close prices, mean returns for returns, covariance for risk, and 100,000 simulations. The title of each graph is how many tickers are used. Also the algorithm doesn't redraw after each calculation, it drops from the previous test. 

I ran around 10 test which you can find in my github repo ([here](https://github.com/diegodalvarez/efficient_frontier)). I also kept track of what tickers are used in which test. What I've noticed is that the efficient frontier starts to fit a more ""curvy"" shape as we decrease the numbers of tickers used. Later tests will involve using different groups of stocks separated by industry, risk, and return characteristics. 

I have also added this function to my app above which you can find by selecting the ticker drop function on the left side bar. It does take a long time with 16 efficient frontiers, more than 300 stocks, and 100,000 simulations each so it takes some time. You can also pull the code from my repo and run it in python yourself.

Something that I've also started working on is using anomaly detection to get rid of the outlier points for the minimum-variance and the mean-markowitz portfolio. 

I was also wondering why this shape occurs. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I'm not sure why with more stocks it looks this way.",Something I noticed with the efficient frontier,,

16,2021-05-11 22:55:28,t3_naa633,naa633,algotrading,"1. My lesson started from contrasting my calculated EMA values with platform such as TradingView and Webull
2. I was surprised that even large platform gives me ***different value*** of EMA for the same symbol and same window size.
3. For example, symbol **COIN** has EMA10/MA10 = **274.08**/286.53 from Webull, but TradingView gave me **283.77**/286.53. (on 05-07-2021)
4. The EMA10 of COIN between two platform is having delta **-9.69** = 274.08 - 283.77 (**3%** of diff.)
5. Then the question here is which one is correct? and why they are different?
6. (Spoiler) TradingView is correct.
7. (If I jump to the conclusion) Fortunately, the delta **only happens** in the scenario that the symbol does not have long enough of price history and **will not happen** if price history is long enough.

[EMA formula from Wiki](https://preview.redd.it/lkcro5megky61.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=005b6f674016de3a13344dd5a322befefe962353)

1. The root cause comes from the EMA formula itself. The very first value (S1) of EMA is very critical, since all subsequent EMA values will dependent the first EMA value. (e.g. S2 = Y2\*1/3 + S1\*2/3, when alpha = 1/3)
2. Let’s call the first value of EMA as **initial value**. The interesting part is there is no a strict way to define what is the initial value. However, the common way in trading is **using the SMA value as the initial value of EMA**. Reference \[2\].
3. Fun fact, If you look into tradingView screen shot, then you would notice the first value of SMA10 and EMA10 are the same.
4. Then how do we calculate correct EMA value? In theory, we should calculate the very first value of the price history and all the way to latest. But, isn’t it inefficient? Then AAPL has so long history, should I calculate from 1980?
5. The answer is it depends on the window size. As long as we prepare long enough of price history versus the window size, then the EMA value will becomes the same. In an other word, as long as the the overall price history is **X** times larger then the window size, then **the effect of initial value will drop**.
6. I did a small experience using Python, in the case of EMA10, as long as your total price history is larger than 4 times (**X**=4, window=10, price history=40), then the EMA10 value will be the same to the **second decimal.**
7. **Key takeaway**: Be careful when the symbol is just IPO, the EMA value could be different depend on which library you used to calculate. Also **MACD** value might be variant a lot since it is based on EMA12 and EMA26.

I had posted by mistake earlier about TradeIdeas - I wanted to ask about TradeStation

I realize there is a separate TradeStation forum, but the activity there is low. So posting it here, hoping for some inputs -

* Can TradeStation be used to execute orders based on a custom built scanner?
* How versatile can the rule setting be?
* What can EasyLanguage be used for - Build scanners, backtesting, order management?
* Would  it be possible to send a bracket order (Limit buy/sell/stoploss) and  then after 10cents profit have an automatic trailing stop trigger and  remove the initial stop loss?
* Can  you build a scanner that scans the whole market for stocks with certain  parameters and then set up an automatic trade set-up to trade those  stocks based on a set strategy?
* Can you backtest only on single stocks or backtest on past scanner results?

I am not a finance researcher so I can not speak to the credibility of the journal or the author, but the analysis the author presents for his claims seem credible enough from my layman's perspective (understandable, all models and sources used, etc.).

Main takeaways I had from the paper:

* No significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional asset classes on returns or volatility. 
   * Only significant correlation was with commodities like gold, on both volatility and risk. 
      * Share common features like a limited supply and their price being driven by aggregate demand and being seen as ""alternatives"" to traditional financial institutions.
* Negative, but not significant, correlation on volatility compared to other assets.
* Significant correlation between trading volume and returns occurring at the same time, as with assets like stock.
* Correlation between lagging returns (returns in the past) and trading volume, hence also future returns.
* Positive and significant correlation between trading volume and volatility (more trading --> more risk), but lagging volatility lead to less trading volume.
* Trading volume effected by both volatility and past returns, but more so the latter.
* Trading activity not significantly correlated with macroeconomic indicators.

I have a strategy that I am running on the 1 min or 5 min interval.  It is getting eaten alive by slippage.  Right now it places market orders.  I am working on optimizing which trades to let go in order to minimize slippage.  I believe this will create a profitable algo, but it is leaving a lot of money on the table (80% reduction in profit due to slippage, which is better than the 120% I was getting before).  Just to illustrate, this strategy can return 10% daily if slippage were not a factor, but loses money in production.  I think I can get it to a couple percent return daily by being more selective on which trades to take (going to test this tomorrow).

If I were to move to limit orders, my fear is that on the best trades I won't get filled and on the worst ones I will, so ultimately I will be worse off.

Can anyone attest to their experience going down this type of road?

Now, it seems like an awfully simple strategy, but when trained on say GOOG (I'vea tried hundreds, all work well) from 2010 to 2018 and then backtested on unseen data from 2019 onward. It's getting some amazing returns, far better than other simple strategies and B&H. 

I'm wondering from the more experienced persons here, what the caveats of such a trading algo? Surely I'm not the first to attempt something like this. 

I'm going to start paper trading with it from next week, so I guess I'll report back to you guys soon anyway.",An Algo that predict's dips and peaks....what problems do you foresee?,,

I was looking into strategies to sell covered calls on some of my shares, and was basically wondering what ideal threshold for otm calls (always selling at 1.5 times the current price for example) to maximize the premiums collected and limit the number of times where my shares get called. Did some python and matplotlib to investiguate and i wanted to share with you.

Obviously the further away from the price the safer it is (first graph), but then I simulated spreading out contacts between two thresholds (sell calls from 1.2 to 1.5 times the price) and how effective that would be (graph 2). As you can see in the second graph, risk gets used with an acceptable loss in premiums, so I can prefer such a scenario.

I pretty much found that for $PLTR the best historic threshold is around 1.3 (you get all the shares called for at the spike that happened in february, but otherwise pretty safe) and spreading from 1.2 to 1.4 can achieve similar outcomes.

I have already studied an elementary econometric course covering regression, multiple regression, binary, logit and probit etc, etc. In the next year or so I will  have the option to choose some more intermediate level to advanced econometric courses. I'm just wondering how applicable the models ill learn in econometrics are to issues outside the social science spectrum? That is, the application of econometric models to data for purposes of non-formal analysis, maybe even call it ""recreational analysis"". For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",Applicability of econometric modelling methods outside of usual social science applications?,,

Given n stocks that were successful at a strategy (or conversely m stocks that weren't), how would you find what they had in common?

 - information & terminology on this approach (there must be a proper name?)
 - general strategies for consuming this type of data
 - specific formats that are commonly used 

I'm happy to dive into any books, source code, whatever resource or other jumping off point that might be helpful. 

For context, I'm building a crypto intelligence platform - basically it aggregates meta-information from many sources (source repositories, social accounts, blogs, forums, governance) into a structured feed of events (releases, partnerships, listings). This has the massive advantage of low latency & great coverage compared to human-curated feeds. I'm exploring how this might be used by trading systems, but I'm completely green in that regard. 

TLDR: I have structured event data that seems relevant for trading, how can I get it to traders most effectively?

146,2021-05-18 01:53:28,t1_gyiq06y,,algotrading,"This seems quite normal from my experience of looking at technical analysis trading systems that focus on high winning percentages (swing/mean reversion) rather than high payoff ratios (trend following).

High win% systems tend to have worse win:loss ratios (payoff ratios) and often use profit targets with far wider stops than normal. The extra risk they're taking is why they're able to achieve high winning percentages.  It allows more room for the swing trade to swing in their favour (at the expense of a much larger loss if it doesn't swing in their favour).

The main thing I guess is he needs to assess what happens if he gets a continuous run of losing trades (perhaps by running some monte carlo simulations over a long testing period).  Looking for the worst case scenario for a run of losses and risk of ruin.

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

196,2021-05-18 09:08:57,t1_gyjrldl,,algotrading,"1. Don’t use coding to dictate your strategy, instead come up with a sound premise like a strategy based on sound market dynamics and it’s states e.g trending, mean reversion, breakout, consolidation. use code to implement that strategy for testing. Your strategy is a hypothesis only. You backtest it as an experiment to test your hypothesis 

2. Ensure you back test with enough sample trades - trading your strategy on 500 trades is not enough sample data to rely on the results. Understand the law of big numbers. You want to expose your strategy to all market conditions and let it place at least 2500 trades for the results to be of value and to give you a better indication as to its edge.

3. Ensure the tick data or backtest data is clean and accurate (no missing candles etc) and also find a way to ensure the spread of your data reflects that of your broker. Spread from 10 years ago is greatly different from today’s average spread and spread can massively affect return (transaction costs add up and can dilute your results as to your strategies real edge)

4. Optimisations are meaningless unless you have ensured the tick data you have tested on is “accurate”, understand what makes tick data accurate.

5. If you’ve identified a sound hypothesis, coded it’s first iteration, tested it on accurate tick data (with enough trades placed) and it has positive results, only then should you navigate towards optimisations and parameter adjustments 

6. If you’ve passed all the stress test from this point, expose it to real world market on demo account and results should reflect your backtest, pre live phase should confirm the same results as your backtest",,gyjrldl,t3_ndl5xf

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future. 

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL). I can see some ways of improving it but I feel like Im trying to achieve smth which is not feasible without collocation and other serious HFT stuff.

I have an idea which revolves around exploring options chain pricing inefficiencies (assuming my math is correct).

In order for my idea to work I need to design a system which can monitor options prices of a handful of companies with large options chains. I have written a matlab script which can take in option spread information along with the stocks variance metric and let me know if there is a likely profitable trade. I won’t go into the specifics here, what I have made is not perfect.

Ideally this would then run over the course of trading days and notify me of any opportunities it see. 

In order for this to work, I need to be able to run my code continuously and retrieve up to date option chain data which can be fed into my script. Is the best way to get this data to physically data scrape financial sites, or are there any python api or packages that would work better? I have seen mixed results and am wondering if anyone here has experience they’d like to share. Ideally any API’s would be free as I am a poor college student at the moment.

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,200 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! However, just using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?

Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

This is apparent if they're using 85 years worth of data (which isn't very practical). Your strategy will have a specific stop-loss which is optimal for it. Obviously a good starting point for building your strategy may be to start with a simple stop-loss based on these observations, but to use it as a hard rule would not be wise.

You also need to account for things like max-drawdown and Sharpe ratio, which will likely be adversely affected by looser stop-losses. Increasing your profit from 1% to 2% isn't worth it if it means you'll get a margin call.

Also consider that a static stop-loss is quite naive. Using a 20% stop-loss as a rule may make sense when your manually day trading and can't constantly keep up with price action, but it won't be as affective as something more dynamic if your having automated system trade for you anyways.",,gym5gcp,t3_nfkgfs

A distribution with a fat tail will have more samples in the center and less samples on the outside, but those outside samples will be more extreme. If you do a test with 200 samples how many are going to show up on that tail?  Will you have enough samples on the tail to really see what the distribution looks like?  So the more fat tailed the distribution is the more samples you need to really see what the distribution curve looks like.  What's more the number of samples you need increases exponentially as the fat-tailedness of the distribution increases.  


So he thinks he understands the profitability of his system with 200 samples when really he probably needs north of 10,000 before he'd realize it doesn't work.

Which fee tier are you in?   
Because i am pretty sure the fees are 0.1% (0.075% with BNB rebates) for Spot trading.   
And with Futures you have 0.04% (0.0360% w/ rebate) Taker and 0.02% Maker (0.018% w/ rebate).

Unless you are a whale on Binance with incredibly high trading volume and 6 figures BNB balance, you are not getting 0.01% fees anywhere.  


But let's do a little calculation here anyways to get a grip if what you are doing is possible. Always do this when developing strategies! Start from a really simple model that is plausible and provable and then put parts in one by one. Never start with a complicated model.  
Let's start easy with following assumptions (we can later add more complications to our model or change its parameters)  


(1) We have no fees  
(2) We make a trading decision every minute  
(3) Volatility: We observe that every minute we expect the price to move by Sigma = 0.15% (up or down) on average throughout the day (this is a somewhat realistic average value for many cryptos. of course volatility changes all the time on every timeframe)  
(4) We close our trade after every minute (for the models simplicity sake. of course you would let a winning position run if the following time horizon has the same prediction)  
(5) Let us assume that our ""HFT algo"" can achieve a 60% prediction up or down for the next minute. (which is pretty good)  
(6) No slippage on market orders, no lag  
(7) We use market orders, so we don't have to worry about fill probabilites (Kappa)  


How much do we profit? In 5 hours (300 minutes) we have 300\*0.6 = 180 winning trades with 0.15% profit = 27%. We lose 120 trades (300\*0.4) with each 0.15% loss = 18%.  
PNL = 27% - 18% = 9%  


Our incredibly simple model makes 9% in 5 hours. wow right? That works. We can procede further. Let us just add fees to our model.   


Let us assume we are trading futures with 0.04% per trade, which is cheaper than spot. We need to pay this fee every time we open AND close a position. In our model that would be 0.08% every trade/minute.  
So here we can see how bad our model gets busted by fees alone: 300 \* 0.08% = 24%  
Our new adjusted PNL = 9% - 24% = -15%. We lost 15% with our ""naive"" HFT algo that had 60% prediction capability every minute...

Our new adjusted PNL = 9% - 24% = -15%. We lost 15% with our ""naive"" HFT algo that had 60% prediction capability every minute...

So how good do we have to be to beat the fees (with this naive ""hft"" model?) and break even on our trades?
To calculate this i made this somewhat time independent and instead of minute closes i plugged in volatility as take profit and stop loss (0.15% each)
For break even we need to solve PNL = 0 = trade_count * win_percentage * TP - trade_count * (1- win-percentage) * SL - (trade_count * fees)
How many trades we do actually does not matter here, so we simplify: 0 = win_percentage * TP - (1- win-percentage) * SL - fees

Get your pen and paper... i'm kidding. We are not in school anymore, we can just plug this into wolframalpha:)

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0+%3D+0.15x+-+%281-x%29+*+0.15+-+0.08

And we can see... to break even with this kind of approach we would need to win roughly 76% of the time.

We can adjust this model however we like and see what wolframalpha tells us:)
Let's say we find out that expected hourly price volatility is now around 1.5% (10 times more movement than on the minute timeframe)

Our next improvement is the following: Since take profit orders can be more easily transformed to limit orders, we can shave off some of our fees.
(i would keep stop loss market orders because stop loss limit orders that are placed on the book depending on a trigger event are not guaranteed to fill)

Instead of 0.08% (two future market orders 0.04% + 0.04%) we expect on average our fees to be: (0.04% + 0.5 * 0.02% + 0.5 * 0.04%) = 0.04% + 0.03% = 0.07%
(This is the worst case estimation of our fees, assuming our algo just coin flips between take profits and stop losses. Ideally we have more take profits and therefore less fees)

Next we want to earn 1% every 24 trades (assume a day of trading) with an average duration of an hour (1.5% volatility). So we place our TP and SL there.

What is the model now? 

profit_percent = trades* win_percentage * TP -  trades * (1- win-percentage) * SL - trades * fees
1 = 24 * x * 1.5 - 24* (1-x) * 1.5 - 24 * 0.07
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+%3D+24+*+x+*+1.5+-+24*+%281-x%29+*+1.5+-+24+*+0.07

402,2021-05-19 01:15:19,t1_gyn4a6o,,algotrading,"No problem. Partly i wanted to write this down for myself also. 
I somewhat already had an idea, but never got around to actually calculate this out for some real world values:)

Maker orders are still 0.02% on binance futures. Let's say we have BNB rebates, so we have 0.018% and since we also need to close the order 0.036% in total.
The model tells us we still need over ~62% success rate to make profit on minute data with ~0.15% volatility on average.

But it gets worse. With limit orders you do not only need to predict if price goes up or down by TP and SL, 
we also need to know if we get filled.

What usually ends up happening is adverse selection: You don't get filled on most of your correct predictions,
(because price ticks up without anyone selling into your bid offer, and your order then rests a few levels deeper in the book and is essentially stale)

And the other way around: You sometimes also make a wrong prediction (30%) and now aggressive sellers gladly fill your bids only to take down your position into a loss.

So you don't get filled on many of your 70% correct predictions and you get filled on many of your 30% wrong predictions, which drags down your success rate to eventually losing money.

(This is also the reason why you can't just go to BitMex or ByBit and coinflip yourself to richness with -0.025% maker rebates)

Using limit orders with a simple statistical ""prediction"" does not suffice. What you need here is a way to solve an what is called an ""optimal control"" problem
in statistics, involving computing fill probability Kappa from level 2 orderbook data.

To make it short: If you have a low fee tier with high fee rates and you only mess with candle data, you wont be able to make it. All the odds are against you.
Fees and limit order mechanics are the way bigger elephant in the room than the problem of latency and colocation. 

I just wanted to spare you the time and money thinking just spinning up an Amazon AWS instance will solve all your problems. Nope. It won't.
But is an incredible interesting topic and there is much to learn and have fun:) 
And who knows... eventually you'll find something good and make money. But don't expect instant results.",,gyn4a6o,t1_gymyzea

I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

I’m trying to doing some historical testing on quarterly sales growth and EPS growth on equities.

I guess if the data doesn’t have the percentage change quarter on quarter then raw sales and eps data that I can then manipulate should also work.

Does anyone know the best place where I can get this data as fair back as possible for US stocks?

I’ve been looking at https://www.quandl.com/ but isn’t clear which package would be best suited for my needs

Any other recommendations or help would be much appreciated

As for code python being so limited with scalability and object orientation, another language may be more interesting… I’ve just moved from .net to open source technologies in a recent job move, i love the speed you can spin up projects with python great for learning stuff for say example trading (playing with packages and apis) and concepts but if your building a trading platform or complex bot something more object orientated (.net, java, scala) or even golang to be honest in my opinion.",,gyooffy,t1_gyokm33

Started off doing the whole indicator slosh pit of stuff trying to find some edge. Problem is, I have always had an edge, its why I wanted to setup the bot.

My risk is the problem, I trade very fast, very frequently, and sometimes positions get too large, or I will have too much on the table, and not pulling enough out back r/R wise .

I have outlines of the bot, mindmaps, endless links, notes everywhere. I know what I want to implement, I just need to do it.   Constantly leaving money on the table and its really killing me.

But sometimes I would run it an get a plot that would look something like this

https://preview.redd.it/lkfv57yutey61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54a0635e1b0c80de79d5a45e6fec964bcd13dc6

I thought it was interesting that I would get this shape with outlier points when I am used to this shape

So I started looking into the problem and my first assumption was the number of tickers. The first test was around 30 stocks and the second test  was 6 stocks. Each used the same calculation method 10y of daily historical adjusted close data using mean returns and covariance with 100,000 simulations. I then built a function in python that drops tickers and then runs the efficient frontier and this is what the results look like. 

https://preview.redd.it/idwa0dmxtey61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0046bb4a209de931b8aafeb2816ce1e3050d86a7

The way that this function works is that it pulls stocks from S&P 500 and then it drops a random amount of tickers then runs the efficient frontier over and over. It uses 10y of historical  adjusted close prices, mean returns for returns, covariance for risk, and 100,000 simulations. The title of each graph is how many tickers are used. Also the algorithm doesn't redraw after each calculation, it drops from the previous test. 

I ran around 10 test which you can find in my github repo ([here](https://github.com/diegodalvarez/efficient_frontier)). I also kept track of what tickers are used in which test. What I've noticed is that the efficient frontier starts to fit a more ""curvy"" shape as we decrease the numbers of tickers used. Later tests will involve using different groups of stocks separated by industry, risk, and return characteristics. 

I have also added this function to my app above which you can find by selecting the ticker drop function on the left side bar. It does take a long time with 16 efficient frontiers, more than 300 stocks, and 100,000 simulations each so it takes some time. You can also pull the code from my repo and run it in python yourself.

Something that I've also started working on is using anomaly detection to get rid of the outlier points for the minimum-variance and the mean-markowitz portfolio. 

I was also wondering why this shape occurs. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I'm not sure why with more stocks it looks this way.",Something I noticed with the efficient frontier,,

For example, let's say you need a moving average. One way to calculate this is: store incoming ticks in an array of size N, and on each tick average the values in the array. If N is large, you can gain efficiency by storing the sum in a state variable. Then each tick you just add the new tick and subtract the oldest one; no looping over N values. There are also filters that do not even need the 'delay line' of the last N ticks; they just continually work with a couple of state variables (IIR filters).

TD Ameritrade's API is very popular for those of us that are interested in trying to build their own trading tools. The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it). 

I really struggled to try deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs is to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

Hope this is helpful to some of you [https://github.com/duncanmcdonald/Dealing-With-TDA-API-Options-Data](https://github.com/duncanmcdonald/Dealing-With-TDA-API-Options-Data)",Dealing With TD Ameritrade API Options Data - Example Solution,,

It's currently generating income for me and my partner and neither of us work for hedge funds or any investment funds, mostly just part time work accumulating over a few years. We started with promising manual strategies and added more automations as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30+ trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years, on data extracted from Thompson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...). 

Here are the results directly from my actual IBKR account so far this year:

Basically I was frustrated how shitty the sec’s api is and how there is no defined format for a lot of forms which makes it very difficult to algorithmically use the data.

This project was quit tough but I managed to make it work. It checks for latest sec filings and parses certain forms and then sends a message to my other bot through a websocket. It is at a point where it serves my needs and I could stop developing it further.

On the other hand, I could see potential in this being expanded in a full fledged api to query parsed sec filings and connect to a WS to include qualitative live data about recent filings.

I’m curious to hear if you guys would find value in such an api mentioned above. If so, I’d be happy to further develop it and make it publicly accessible.

Do you guys incorporate sec filings into your strategy? If so how have you been getting the required info so far algorithmically?

We use our current feature set because it's the one which results in the most accurate model based on what we've tested so far. While the training assigns weights to each feature based on its importance, it's not a good idea to include ALL possible features (we generate a thousand or so) and hope it comes up with the most important set on its own.

810,2021-05-20 04:53:17,t3_ngr5jq,ngr5jq,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

&#x200B;

Hi,

I realize there is a separate TradeIdeas forum, but the activity there is low. So posting it here, hoping for some inputs -

* Can TradeStation be used to execute orders based on a custom built scanner?
* How versatile can the rule setting be?
* What can EasyLanguage be used for - Build scanners, backtesting, order management?
* Would  it be possible to send a bracket order (Limit buy/sell/stoploss) and  then after 10cents profit have an automatic trailing stop trigger and  remove the initial stop loss?
* Can  you build a scanner that scans the whole market for stocks with certain  parameters and then set up an automatic trade set-up to trade those  stocks based on a set strategy?
* Can you backtest only on single stocks or backtest on past scanner results?

And yes, I have asked myself why has no one else done this if this strategy is so good? And I have a reasonable answer I wont share because I would rather not give away the strategy.

The issue is it won't work well with a low amount of capital and this strategy is most profitable with millions of pounds or dollars being used. I dont have much capital at all because I'm a student so I can't really employ this strategy myself.

Is a typical RDMS good for this, or one should look into time series DB or other data streaming DB? Also please suggest the kind of cloud technologies needed to support this conversion to FIX.

An Empirical Assessment""](https://jai.pm-research.com/content/23/2/162) published last fall in the Journal of Alternative Investments.

I am not a finance researcher so I can not speak to the credibility of the journal or the author, but the analysis the author presents for his claims seem credible enough from my layman's perspective (understandable, all models and sources used, etc.).

Main takeaways I had from the paper:

* No significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional asset classes on returns or volatility. 
   * Only significant correlation was with commodities like gold, on both volatility and risk. 
      * Share common features like a limited supply and their price being driven by aggregate demand and being seen as ""alternatives"" to traditional financial institutions.
* Negative, but not significant, correlation on volatility compared to other assets.
* Significant correlation between trading volume and returns occurring at the same time, as with assets like stock.
* Correlation between lagging returns (returns in the past) and trading volume, hence also future returns.
* Positive and significant correlation between trading volume and volatility (more trading --> more risk), but lagging volatility lead to less trading volume.
* Trading volume effected by both volatility and past returns, but more so the latter.
* Trading activity not significantly correlated with macroeconomic indicators.

Obviously you can backtest whatever currency you want on whatever chart period you want with whichever timeframe/indicators you want. BUT I've done about 60 backtests in the last two hours just tweaking small things to get the best results and it got me thinking:

&#x200B;

**If you can create a backtest to setup an algorithm for a bot to trade off of, can't there also just be a bot that auto backtests every variable on every currency that's available to you to, to generate the best possible trading algorithm on every currency(for the time it was created) without spending hours on 100's or 1,000's of backtests? Sure that is a large amount of data processing, but I'd assume the ends would justify the means.**

&#x200B;

I've looked around everywhere and searched everything that I can think of and can't find an auto-backtesting bot. Perhaps it is because I simply don't know what to search *for*. Even then, anyone I've talked to who is into Forex, Stocks, or Crypto and have used backtests before for their own trading strats, has never heard about anything similar to what I described above.

I can't be the only one who has thought of this. Surely it exists right?",Do Auto Back Testers Exsist?,,

A little bit of a follow up post to my post about being an engineer last week ( [https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/n9imc8/what\_if\_you\_are\_just\_an\_engineer/](https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/n9imc8/what_if_you_are_just_an_engineer/) ). 

One of the users (shoutout u/[**Prize\_Bass\_5061**](https://old.reddit.com/user/Prize_Bass_5061)**)**  in the post commented about the wheel strategy, which is a relatively well known options trading strategy. After spending some time simulating it and experimenting with it this more seems like something I am looking for. It is a little longer term, and is more about watching prices and probability, less about playing specific signals on a chart (not that there is anything wrong with that, I've just really struggled to grasp some of that). 

Is there a particular term for this type of trading? is this just options trading? This systematic style approach just really makes a lot more sense to me. Do you guys know of any other strategies like this?

I have a strategy that I am running on the 1 min or 5 min interval.  It is getting eaten alive by slippage.  Right now it places market orders.  I am working on optimizing which trades to let go in order to minimize slippage.  I believe this will create a profitable algo, but it is leaving a lot of money on the table (80% reduction in profit due to slippage, which is better than the 120% I was getting before).  Just to illustrate, this strategy can return 10% daily if slippage were not a factor, but loses money in production.  I think I can get it to a couple percent return daily by being more selective on which trades to take (going to test this tomorrow).

If I were to move to limit orders, my fear is that on the best trades I won't get filled and on the worst ones I will, so ultimately I will be worse off.

Can anyone attest to their experience going down this type of road?

Eventually I will probably test anyway but the process of iterating at night, trying it out during the day, then combing through the results is actually taking much longer than I would have expected, so I am looking ahead here.",Is it possible to improve on market orders?,,

As the moment, backtesting it.....it seems pretty impressive.

The strategy (with accompanying SL) buys at high probability dips. It holds those positions unless a SL is triggered or a high probability of it being a peak is reached and it sells. 

Now, it seems like an awfully simple strategy, but when trained on say GOOG (I'vea tried hundreds, all work well) from 2010 to 2018 and then backtested on unseen data from 2019 onward. It's getting some amazing returns, far better than other simple strategies and B&H.

I was looking into strategies to sell covered calls on some of my shares, and was basically wondering what ideal threshold for otm calls (always selling at 1.5 times the current price for example) to maximize the premiums collected and limit the number of times where my shares get called. Did some python and matplotlib to investiguate and i wanted to share with you.

Obviously the further away from the price the safer it is (first graph), but then I simulated spreading out contacts between two thresholds (sell calls from 1.2 to 1.5 times the price) and how effective that would be (graph 2). As you can see in the second graph, risk gets used with an acceptable loss in premiums, so I can prefer such a scenario.

I pretty much found that for $PLTR the best historic threshold is around 1.3 (you get all the shares called for at the spike that happened in february, but otherwise pretty safe) and spreading from 1.2 to 1.4 can achieve similar outcomes.

For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",Applicability of econometric modelling methods outside of usual social science applications?,,

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL).

I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains.

It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years on data extracted from Thompson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).
