Bond yields are ticking a bit lower. 10-year down to 1.569, perhaps an indication that investors are less worried about inflation. Disappointing new home sales yesterday likely contributed to that. The VIX is down to about 20, but not sure if that really means anything anymore.

There just isn’t that much to move markets today. Couple Fed speeches. Bank CEOs will testify before a joint session of Congress. Some earnings, but mostly not until after the close: Dick’s Sporting Goods, Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, NVIDIA, Snowflake.

I am currently still learning about finance, but i have a few questions in mind.

How should i invest my money i will get from paychecks and savings? (currently looking for jobs)

What investments should i focus on, like stocks, index funds, crypto or mining? My friend mines ethereum and makes 45 dollars everyday, but the miner costed him 10k. So if i calculate it correctly his ROI will break even in 8 months. I dont know if mining crypto is worth it, but it seems really cool and fun. Please tell me about your experiences.

What books, videos etc to learn about financial literacy. Marketing, strategies, and so on. I have read rich dad poor dad. 

What are some ways to make passive income, that are worth it and not very hard to set up. I heard about afiliate marketing and e commerce and rental income but that wont be happening anytime soon. 

If i start doing e commerce or sell on Amazon fba is it profitable, is it hard? Because i watch alot of youtube videos of dropahippers making 100k a month. Ifk if its bs, because everyone on yt magicslly makes 100k a month from this business. 

Also, i am going to become a electrician or automatician i think, so ill make 50k a year with no debt.

Thank you for taking your time reading this",nldvyr,Iam 16 years old and how should i invest my money?

Starting early is a great way to be able to retire financially comfortabe,  but , go hang out with some old people.   They generally have enough money,  but old age sucks.  Enjoy being young,  take your money and spend it on experiences you aren't going to do when you're older.

He's got too many responsibilities to go hiking for a month.  When the kid is grown and moved out,  he's not going to be in shape for that kind of hike.   Reality sucks too.

34,gzi0oj6,2021-05-26 11:06:56,t1_gzi0oj6,t1_gzhldel,investing,"> Yeah but those fairly routine pensions were not sustainable.

I have to disagree.  They are working fine in many other western countries where the actuaries are allowed to do their jobs and the CFOs can not mess with them.

Life expectancy has increased a great deal, but most of that is due to reduced infant mortality, vaccines for childhood disease and not getting killed as often on the job.  But what matters in this discussion of pensions is life expectancy at retirement age.

In 1940 a 65 year old American could expect to live another 12.7 years [source](https://www.ssa.gov/history/lifeexpect.html)

In 2018 a 65 year old American could expect to live another 18.1 years [source](https://www.ssa.gov/history/lifeexpect.html)

So an improvement of 5.4 years, however in the meantime the full retirement age has been bumped to 67 so the net increase in retirement years is only 3.4.  

Pensions provide effective means to mitigate longevity risk (by pooling longevity over a large group of people of the same retirement age) and sequence of returns risk (by pooling that risk over large groups of different retirement ages).  What they do not do is let financial service companies bleed retail investors for fees.

The pension system is broken in the United States, but it does not need to be so.  However a lot of people stand to make a lot of money out of this mess, and they have a loud voice in the financial press.

Finally, if a professionally run pension system can not provide for retirement income then what chance does an individual have with a 401k/IRA?",,
35,gzi0r0s,2021-05-26 11:07:46,t1_gzi0r0s,t3_njy53z,investing,"Kind of weird reading some of the responses here with regards to Kraken.  Coinbase Pro has a better fee structure than Kraken and significantly more liquidity, meaning less slippage. If you're actively trading, you should use Pro.  I strongly disagree that Kraken is in any way easier to use, but I'll leave that as a matter of taste. 

Analysts expect revenue to decline > 30% in Q2. Publicly available data suggests that Coinbase has already matched Q1 revenue with 5 weeks to go in the quarter. They are on pace to beat full-year estimates by \~50%. Their custody and prime brokerage businesses are going to be big revenue drivers and have excellent defensibility. 

Below is my thread on Coinbase's future prospects which touches on some of their opportunities and why ""crypto winter"" isn't going to be as bad as people think. If people want to throw a company trading at a 11 forward multiple under the bus, that's their prerogative. But you are ignoring that this is the most profitable tech company IPO ever and they are positioned to be the Google of their industry. Keep an open mind and you may like what you see.

Pension funds can also bleed investors of their money, depending on their fee structures. Oftentimes that function is outsourced and it’s not like some company is doing it for free out of the kindness of their hearts.

Furthermore, pension funds have to take meaningfully less risk (which translates to lower returns) than do individual investors over the course of their lives as the money is pooled both to provide for current retirees as well as future ones. The most common private pension scheme in Germany has a guaranteed rate of return of 0.9%. Nominal. You pay 4% up front to the scheme on contributions. 2.5% yearly admin fee. Net of fees, your promised real returns are negative. Not to mention that 20% of German pension funds are at risk of insolvency and many more will be at risk if low interest rates persist.

If you go to /r/eupersonalfinance you will very quickly find out that the pension system in Europe is much more fragile than you’re making it out to be. They have to invest in stocks just like we do. State pension income replacement rates are certainly higher, but usually funded by higher contributions (in Germany it is ~18% of your salary, half paid by employer and half by employee).",,

You have to be going nearly orbital speed for point to point travel over any appreciable distance - which requires full re-entry heat shields and hypersonic aircraft design.

The reason for this is that the Earth is a very big sphere with a radius of 6400km. In order to fly from one point to another ballistically, your flight path has to have enough of this 6400km circle such that you intersect the atmosphere at your destination. Given the difference between orbit at 150km and the ground at 0km is just 2% the radius of this circle, you need to be doing almost orbital speed to go from New York to Sydney.

When you play Kerbal Space Program, you can see this. The time it takes to go for transoceanic abort to orbit is usually just a few seconds of burn time. Reentry is pretty similar in either scenario. It's fiery and hot.",,

They've been that way for a while now. Automobile manufacturing is a costly, difficult business - there's a massive list of carmakers in the US that have gone bankrupt over the years - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States. Aston Martin has gone bankrupt 7 times and almost was #8 last year.

Could there be some degree of multiple expansion if legacy companies succeed in EV? Possibly, but EVs don't make a difficult business any easier. How many times has Tesla talked about being in distress along the way? This is an industry where few succeed, but in the last year the way that people were buying anything EV-related would suggest people thought all of these names were going to succeed.

People hyped up EVs to the point of a massive bubble in things like WKHS last year, which only delivered 6 trucks last quarter. A lot of the weaker/weakest EV plays have now lost well over half their value. Rob Arnott called the rise in EV stocks a ""big market delusion"": 

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.” (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)

Amusingly, Ark seems to now be inching towards Volkswagen the other day after acting like anything that wasn't named Tesla was a dinosaur.

""I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode""

Of course they do. Weedstocks thinks weed stocks are going to the moon. So much of the silver stuff that I've seen resembles variations on precious metal bug blogs a decade ago.

I’m 23 years old, CPA, currently investing about $2,000 per month into individual stocks. Total portfolio is about $40k, made up of 28 stocks. Mostly high multiple tech (ARK stocks), but also some healthcare, big tech, and REITs for the yield. I also have a Roth that I contribute $500 per month.

I won’t need the money for 20-30+ years, and I’m comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I’ve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. How often should I be taking profit? Does this strategy make sense long-term?

Thanks in advance",,

Short term (i think/hope) they will have a blow out quarter,  they are such a well run company that they said they don't expect any problems with chip shortages that are shutting down the other car manufacturers. Morningstar has them rated as a three,  but said they will reevaluate after the June numbers come out and I expect those will be good. 

Medium term,  I really don't think the infrastructure for mass adoption of pure Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) will be in place for a lot longer than people anticipate, for example,  large number of chargers in apartment building or hotel parking lots.   Toyota has the Plug in Hybrid (PHEV) that is the perfect balance right now of a 60%-80% EV, but can go anywhere without range anxiety.   They have two models right now and more coming next year (I think).  They currently have eight regular hybrid models (all the minivans are hybrid) that look really good.   This should improve the financials even more since it's less CAFE credits to purchase making the other companies Pure BEV need to actually be profitable instead of supplemented by selling CAFE credits.  

Long term they have the scale and are working on both advanced batteries and Hydrogen and will be ready whichever becomes adopted.   They do have a pure BEV for next year,  and expect eight models by 2025 which i think is still plenty early even with optimistic assumptions about infrastructure.

Examples; 

* The only thing they are / aim to be dependent on for true, force majeure delays is raw materials (think, the aluminum and steel for components).
* A communications satellite antenna part costs $100K? No, it doesn’t. Find a way to make it yourself, I mean, it’s just soldered circuits in a titanium box, right? You can do it in house for $4K? Great.
* Supplier gives an 8 month lead time for a rocket fairing? Well, how much of that is straight manufacturing vs. waiting on sub-contracted sub-components? Let’s just repurpose 2000 sqft of the main factory floor and build our own fairings in 2 weeks.
* Anything that they have the manufacturing ability to make themselves, short of nuts and bolts probably, they will attempt to make themselves. That way they aren’t depending on lead and shipping time and supplier shortages.
* Analysis is in-house. Rocket blew up? Wait, your external engineering consulting firm is asking for $500K and 4 months to run FEA failure simulations on it? No. Re-purpose 4 engineers in my team who specialize in it, and get me an answer by end of the day. It doesn’t even have to be right, but we’ll have a plan for tomorrow.
* Single (or few) product lines. Falcon, Dragon, Starlink. That’s it.

Au contraire, most large Fortune 500s will subcontract everything, run a lean inventory, pray that just-in-time shipping doesn’t get stopped by a hurricane, project manage EVERYTHING, run loss-leaders as product lines to diversify, and there’s a preferred Smith Engineering Consultants LLC for every contracted out field of design and failure analysis imaginable.

From the little I understand of the company, there are two parts to their vision:

1) Space tourism.  This is basically just a gimmick for the small number of super-wealthy who are willing to pay a fortune to be weightless in space for a few min.  Can't really build a business around this.

2) High speed international travel.  This is the more realistic part of the business.  If you could fly from the US to Paris in 90 minutes, that would significantly change air travel.

Early this year, they decided to change clearing firms, from Apex to their own in-house firm, Axos Clearing. The transition was supposed to be seamless; it wasn't. They ""lost"" both my main investing account and my IRA (about $25k total) for about a month. Couldn't find them in the system, couldn't access them, nada. When they finally recovered the accounts, I transferred them over to TD Ameritrade (ACATS, *not* a liquidation).

Once I saw the funds hit my TDA account, I thought the nightmare was finally over. Until I noticed that the value of my securities and my YTD P/L were the same number. I contacted TDA, and they said that Axos had not provided them with my cost basis info at the time of transfer, and that they had requested it from them a couple of times. I contacted Axos myself, and was told that they were still working on getting it from the former custodian (Apex, I'm assuming), and would send it to TDA once they got it.

It's been a few months now, and I'm getting nervous, because  I already made a couple of trades in the non-IRA account, and I'm showing an $8,000 capital gain, which should be far less.

Low volume overall is a factor, but that alone doesn’t concern me too much. If low liquidity combines with other factors… that’s when trouble can brew. 

Keep an eye on the dollar, bonds, and high yield debt for clues to when something may go wrong. All looks well at the moment, but don’t lose sight of them.

EUR/USD 

This is approaching its January high. I don’t think it will be a double top. The fed wants a weaker dollar and I think they will make it happen. It just takes longer than traders are willing to accept. I expect resistance as it reaches the January high which could then cause some turbulence in everything, but I still expect it to push higher this summer.

10 Year Bond 

This been in a range of 1.5-1.7 at it’s pre-pandemic levels. It’s approaching the lower end of the range and looks like it could have the setup to drop lower but another reversal higher along with a dollar in correction would give me caution in stocks.

High yield debt

Want the best indicator to market risk? Look no further than high yield debt. Simply put, if this is correcting I make myself have the patience to wait for it to calm down before buying any stocks. 

Right now high yield debt looks good, but the weakening trend since the start of the year is concerning. It’s correction coming out of the March lows was strong and it’s move down in the last month has not been able to find momentum to the downside. It looks poised to break the weak downtrend of the last month. ",,

I wanted to mainly comment on the article though, I just didn’t wanted to start shiting on it without valid opinion. Over my now longer life I’ve noticed a trend. There these very strongly written articles and doomsday preaching documentaries that follow the same template. They only change the topic through the years. When I was very young I read and watched a number of things about the deforestation of the rain forest and the huge hole in ozone layer. I was young so I took that to heart. I also remember the solution captain Planet offered(eco friendly cartoon superhero). He suggested we stop using paper bags in the grocery store and start using plastic bags. Keep in mind I was in Eastern Europe where there were no bags available in the store, you always bring your own. Now many years later the ozone layer has healed and it turned out corporation are cutting down the rainforest to open land for animal raising and it’s not for paper. Now we are watching documentaries showing a huge pile of plastic bags floating in the ocean and the climate change caused by the cars and not the ships they say. If you’re following along you will know why the article is so strongly worded. The more extreme the language and data the more likely it will get the attention of more people. It got your attention so you’re sharing it too. I understand the climate is getting warmer and weather gets more extreme as consequence. However, at this moment billions are invested in developing Florida’s beach front properties. Some of them are not even diversifying lol. I watched Florida’s cost transform over the last decade while reading that the ocean is rising. In summary they will be a few companies that will need to change a lot but I wouldn’t stress over it.

1) They don't want competition for the same target from other SPACs.

2) If an announcement is made too prematurely, the target company will have an advantage in the negotiations. 

3) If the deal doesn’t go through, SPACs credibility takes a big hit resulting in investor pull out. By keeping the names a secret, in the event of a deal falling apart, they can quietly move on to the next target without public embarrassment.

Whole Foods in 2017 reported around $16 billion in revenue in 2017, the same year MGM reported $1.3 billion in revenue. Those numbers, along with the fact that analysts valued MGM at $5.5 billion in December 2020, shows just how valuable the studio’s assets are for Amazon’s plan to touch nearly every part of its customers’ lives through Prime. CEO Jeff Bezos said in April that 175 million customers have used Prime Video in the last year. Those numbers would put Amazon within spitting distance of Netflix’s nearly 208 million subscribers.

It's not really a crisis either or unexpected.  When the SLR exemptions were removed earlier this year, one of the potential issues people were concerned with was excess deposit money flooding into money market funds and pushing t-bill rates to zero or negative which is exactly what has happened.

There's a bunch of excess cash sitting around as deposits currently and not enough short term debt or overnight borrowing to put it into for money market funds and banks.  That's pushed all these rates towards zero or in some cases below.  That matters to the Fed because it impacts their target rate and  they enforce that rate through OMO, repo and reverse repo operations like this.  It should also be transitory as it's largely caused by the US treasury drawing down the TGA for the most recent round of stimulus and maybe tax refunds going out as well.

In short, I do.  Now, do you remember what they used to say about IBM in the 1950s-1960s and their stupid computers.  IBM, MSFT, AAPL, DELL, HPQ, all of them had a huge run from the 1960s-2010s.  With that said.  SPCE, if it works will have a similar run, you are getting in on the ground level.  Need I mention TSLA 10 years ago that you would have bought at $25.   Most serious investors, unless they are in already, will not join you until later stages.  When they join, the stock will get so expensive you will pass it by and miss it. 

They have a different approach from Space X and others.  They have a plane that launches another small plane into space.  It is re-usable and can carry people to the edge of space.  They will be the low cost travel to low altitude space.  No other company that I know is currently doing that.  They already have a their own Space Port and have successfully launch people to lower orbit.  They do not have rockets, their business is to take people to lower level orbit for a short time and give everyone a taste of what it means to go to space.

This stock is not one that you will see with any amount of real revenue soon, but they have a plan and it is new and with the backing they have (Virgin Companies), they will likely be successful.  Get some money there and let it be.  Never invest what you are not willing to lose and things will look clearer.  

Sincerely,

YT Professor Choy",,

I'm going to lay it too you straight: Virgin Galactic is a BS company with no real future, which is seeing stock bumps based on mostly meaningless accomplishments and (more important) the fact that people want to desperately invest in SpaceX, but can't. Virgin Galactic is the girlfriend you get when the one of your dreams isn't remotely interested in you.

First, let's talk about business model. Its suborbital fights.To date it's sold about about 600 tickets for $250,000 for what amounts to a joy ride where you experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the earth in a vehicle, that despite extensive testing, is far less safe than a jetliner (obviously). 

Wealthy adventure seekers and influencers with deep enough pockets and tolerance of risk will go for it. How big is that market really? For comparison climbing Mount Everest, a modestly comparable ""once in a lifetime adventure"" costs about $50,000 on average. The very upper end of an Everest adventure is $150,000. An expedition also takes about two months, after months of preparation. So adventurers are getting a substantial return on their $50,000 - $150,000.

&#x200B;

By contrast, a Virgin Galactic flight amounts to an afternoon trip. About 3 hours, and 5 minutes of weightlessness for $250,000. Word will get out on that among those who could afford that real fast: it's a dangerous rip off, and you're better off waiting for a the real thing.

Well a Blue Origin New Shepard Flight will be significantly more substantial a suborbital experience for a (reportedly) comparable price. Furthermore in terms of ""experience factor"" (which is ultimately, what you're paying for), you experience blasting off on a rocket and landing in a capsule... way more ""adventure-y"" than taking off and landing like an airplane. I know that sounds ridiculous on its face, but folks are only buying experience, and nothing else. And the more authentic space experience? The one that blasts off like a rocket and lands like Apollo 11, or the one that is closer to a business jet?

&#x200B;

But even New Shepard is pretty B.S. too because its experience will be both costly and short. The ROI, compared to an Everest Expedition, is still ridiculous.

Really, what people would be looking for is a two week trip to space on a Crew Dragon or Starship, the former of which are in an entirely other price bracket (for now) and the latter is years away. That, with a couple of weeks of space-training (or however long they do it for a fully private trip like that down the road), would be much more in line with the Everest model of a high-price adventure with a substantial ROI. 

&#x200B;

Virgin Galactic said that they expect $1 billion in revenue annually at their spacepot. That's a complete joke. They would have to sell 4000 tickets a year, and fly three times a day. They will not sell 4000 tickets a year. They will not fly three times a day including weekends and holidays. They have one vehicle that can fly.  Even with two more, they won't turn them around in less than 24 hours. And they won't be durable enough to fly without prolonged maintenance at that rate. That's better than even a Boeing jet.

It's a trap. It's a huge trap. I've been saying it's a trap well before meme stocks and SpaceX being substantial. It's been Richard Branson's flight of fancy for nearly 20 years because unlike Elon Musk, he did not have the ambition or vision to develop actual orbital spaceflight from the ground. And that's not typical Elon bootlicking. The fact is, for folks who weren't old enough to remember, in the Early 2000s, in the wake of Columbia, a lot of private space companies started. A bunch of them tried to buy surplus government hardware. A number of them also tried to do suborbital because it was supposed to be cheaper, faster and easier. That is where Virgin Galactic fell. But tell me if you've heard some of these names: Rocketplane Kistler, Excalibur Almaz, Space Transport Corporation, Mir Corp, Armadillo Aerospace,  XCOR Aerospace. Many more mostly paper companies.

&#x200B;

Who made it from that era?

SpaceX, Orbital, SNC, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic. And of that list, Orbital and SNC's overall business long predate the commercial space era, Blue Origin has Bezos billions and SpaceX is the only one to truly start from scratch and launch things into space. Even Orbital spent years largely relying on old Russian engines and retired US ICBMs - as I said, the original private space model of using surplus government equipment to skip developing technology from scratch. Only SpaceX and Virgin Galactic did it. Difference being, SpaceX aimed higher, while Virgin Galactic built shoddy vehicles, on bad times, and got people killed in the process.

Can you make money in the short term on Virgin Galactic? Probably. There just isn't a lot of options for people who want to invest in the commercial space industry, and our darling SpaceX just isn't interested in going public. 

But in the long term? 

\- It's business forecast make no sense and presumes a flight rate it'll never meet.

\- It's nearest competitor, Blue Origin, will offer a better experience and compete for the same customers and nearly the same price target.

\- Given its rate of technical development, it'll be 15 years minimum before it puts a person into space, and by then, ""Block II"" Starships with huge passenger loads will (potentially) be flying into orbit. 

Does this sound like a serious space company? Does this sound like a business worth investing in? Getting SPCE as its symbol just underscores the lack of seriousness of it as a business. Yeah guys... totally SpaceX, right? Totally about space travel, right? Ridiculous.  It's a suborbital stunt flight vehicle with no future and a business that's been built on bad tech and bad promises since four years before the Falcon 1 flew the first time.

Avoid it if going long. Short, better people can give you advice for that. But long... no shot. It's bullshit.",,

Depending where you are at in life, there is a decent chance that you'll have money in the market during a crash. Law of large numbers and all that. (Or even multiple if you are young!) But, we have no idea when that's going to be. Could crash next week. Could crash in 8 years. If you hold your money back and it turns out the 8 year scenario is more accurate though, then there's every possibility that the crash won't even extend down to the current price point. Meaning now was really the last time to get in at these prices. And if it turns out to be next week, well, yeah, that does suck. However, if your holding for decades it's fairly irrelevant actually. 

Then there's also the possibility that you fuck up trying to buy the crash. Lots of people missed the bottom of the covid crash thinking that the market still had a much larger fall coming. Turns out it didn't, and they lost a lot of money trying to time the crash. 

Try not to let the fact that the market grew scare you. The only time that scares me is when I'm making individual stock plays.

>The success by activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 in getting at least two candidates on Exxon's board marks a big loss for the largest U.S. oil company, which incurred a $20 billion-plus loss in 2020 and has been slower to embrace lower-carbon investments than its global rivals. Exxon had sought to stave off investors aiming to reshape the board to better align the company with global moves to combat climate change.  
>  
>Two of Engine No. 1's board nominees, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, were elected to Exxon's board, with counting continuing.  
>  
>The dissident shareholder group led by Engine No. 1 put up a slate of four nominees to the 12-member Exxon board of directors at the shareholder meeting in the first big boardroom contest at an oil major that makes climate change the central issue.

>Exxon has lagged other oil majors in its response to climate change concerns, forecasting many more years of oil and gas demand growth and doubling down on investments to boost its output - in contrast to global rivals that have scaled back fossil fuel investments.

>That approach boosted the company's debt load by billions of dollars in recent years, leading to a record $22 billion loss in 2020 after years of underperformance.

Walmart buys and sells all of the same products today.  So their spend would go higher yield lower purchase price points for WMT.  Immediate synergies.  Also, no cannibalization of existing sales.  Walmart and Rite Aid already co-exist.  The spend that is done at Walmart at its large department stores is separate from the ""convenience"" spend that is done at local, nearby retail pharmacies.  Another synergy is that the larger spend with product vendors and prescription providers will also yield a reduced cost on Walmart's existing business base.  So the result is a big net incremental gain for WMT of $24 billion in sales and $3 - $5 billion in profit. 

For Amazon, perhaps the same synergies are not in place.  However, if Amazon allows Walmart to snap up RAD, the AMZN should just get out of the pharmacy space.  The business will never scale up to warrant the focus.  

Amazon knows they can't run a pharmacy business without a physical retail chain.  That is why they are now investigating this option.  The idea that they will put pharmacies in Whole Foods is ludicrous.  You don't create a space for sick people to come to get their medicines when you are trying to promote fresh, healthly, organic food options.  Whole Foods is a no-go.  As for starting to build your own chain of brick and mortar retail locations --- forget it.  Walmart buys RAD and leaves AMZN in the dust.

I’m no expert, but here is some food for thought based on my learning in stocks...

1) You need a well-defined system in order to be profitable.  Your trade idea is to buy large cap stocks after they post small gains and ride the momentum until they stop moving up.  Are you talking about gains between market open and close, or do intraday gains count?  How much of a loss will you accept before cutting a bad trade?  Does there need to be a catalyst gain, or or do any old gains count.  That’s just the tip of the iceberg of what swing traders typically consider.

2) A typical trading system goes through these steps:  study, back test, trade in a simulated account, trade with very small amounts, trade full size. Beginners tend to be impatient, so they skip the prep steps and then lose their money.

3) Typical swing trading systems break the total bankroll into 10 parts (that would make your trade size $1,000 each)

4) There is a popular swing trading system called CANSLIM that I suggest you read about.  It has fairly simple rules and is popular among less experienced traders.  investors business daily has a subscription service where they give you tons of good stocks to consider with notes about how they stack up in the CANSLIM system.  It costs about $40 per month and gives you stocks to consider while teaching you the context of why they are good for swing trading.

5) you need a trading platform that can support this type of trading.  I suggest thinkorswim through TD Ameritrade

Hope this helps!

Considering you're already worrying about short term returns, being in leveraged funds is going to make you more likely to sell in a downturn and thus have a negative effect on your returns.

Now moving into more personalized advice that others might debate, I would also encourage you to ignore stock picking and crypto and leverage and options and all the other ""sexy"" shit people talk about and do a simple 3 fund portfolio and just focus on piling money into it.

Gotta love the hot takes from redditors who think they know more about the streaming business (or any business really) than the executives who specialize in that business.

Piracy is not as much of a threat to the majority of these players anymore.  The subscription costs don't just buy you access to their content, it buys you convenience.  The convenience of having that content on any device, anytime, anywhere.  I'm sure someone will brag about how their sick plex server or whatever bullshit, but your average consumer doesn't want to deal with that nonsense.  The majority just wants to hit a button on their phone or TV remote and see the content as soon as it's available    

> it becomes more expensive with each one incrementing prices and a new service popping up every 5 minutes?

>We use data from the U.S. airline industry to test the hypothesis, consistent with the general equilibrium oligopoly model of Azar and Vives (forthcoming), that inter-industry common ownership should be associated with lower prices in product markets. We find that, as the model predicts, increases over time in intra-industry common ownership are associated with higher prices, while increases in inter-industry common ownership are associated with lower prices. We also find that common ownership by the “Big Three” (BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street) is associated with lower airline prices, while common ownership by shareholders other than the Big Three is associated with higher prices.

I would add on to what the others are saying, have the majority of your holdings and things that will guarantee a steady return over the next 30 years like the total US market, QQQ, small cap value, but you can do ""satellite investing"" with a much smaller allocation (less than 20%) in single stocks and other riskier things.

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&#x200B;

I would recommend avoiding BTC until tether is fully audited and we know what companies that commercial paper is from.",ng3im3,The truth about tether and crypto prices

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

- 50% american stocks (market ETF)
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
- 15 % India (market ETF)
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
- 10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

635,,2021-05-19 16:40:46,t3_ngamt2,,investing,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",ngamt2,Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

&#x200B;

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):** 

\-Expense ratio 0.015%, 1yr +45.97%, 5yr +23.41%, 10yr +14.16%

**Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)**

\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%

&#x200B;

In this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement & Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President & CEO of DDC.",nh1ol9,Drone Delivery Canada selected by UBC for remote communities delivery initiative

My takeaway from the comments as a whole, and further reading suggests that entering a leveraged ETF position to hold might be a very good idea if you wait for a major correction and get in then.

Generally to enforce the “public good” necessarily requires a concentration of power because it’s impossible for everyone to agree on what is “good for the public”. Enforcement of the public good has been a huge sticking point of collectivist philosophies throughout history and that is not unique to Marxism (i.e. French Revolution). But democratic socialism has so many flavors I would need to know which philosophical strain strain we’re talking about.

>	Everything else you described has nothing to do with farming and everything to do with private ownership of land. 

I know farming as root cause of class struggle isn’t a mainstream argument but I literally have not found one agricultural based society throughout history that has mitigated the exploitation of people. I ask because I’m looking to poke a hole in my argument. 

>	What if there never were any kings (people that own all the land)?

This was how we lived for a couple hundred thousand years, and humans did not live in peace with one another. We banded into tribes and there was a constant struggle for resources, not a sharing of resources (the tribal struggle?). If you think about it on a biological level humans compete for 100% of the same resources as other humans. Why should I let you have access to the best land with the most food and the hottest chicks if I am as entitled to it as you are? The tribal societies were pretty much all conquered by agricultural societies. 

>	Privatisation is what leads to class struggle. Nothing else

A problem with disbanding our kingdom and giving everything back to the people is then who will stop the kingdom next door from taking over our land? This is the impossible dilemma of democratic socialism - I’ll give you the land back AND protect you from your neighbors AND do it equally There is an inherent instability in this equation that will necessarily lead to a concentration of power. A stable system needs checks and balances to power.

It would appear as though I was partially mistaken. I will likely update my strategy because of this. What actually occurs to any security in S&P 500, Russel 1000, or QQQ is any price movement of greater than 10% of the last day’s close results in a 15-minute halt. So the actual advice should be as follows:

In the occurrence of a black swan event, QQQ can only drop by, at most 10% every 15 minutes. A drop of 10% is highly likely, but not guaranteed, to correspond to a drop of at least 7% on S&P, triggering a market-wide halt. If not, the halt of all QQQ-listed securities (for 15 minutes) will likely result in the bid-ask of QQQ to become quite wide due to the difficultly of price discovery while all of their assets aren’t trading. This corresponds to a 30% drop in TQQQ before a temporary halt occurs.

So it is theoretically possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day. It would require that all of its holdings *not in the S&P 500* drop more than 20% in one day. Due to how many stocks are listed in both, you would need a pretty severe drop in the others (with those listed in both dropping <20%) for QQQ to drop >20% while S&P drops <20%.

So, TL;DR: it is possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day; however, it requires S&P 500 to drop less than 20% while the few (relatively) insignificant holdings of QQQ to drop significantly more than 20%. TQQQ should also not drop more than 30% in a short period of time without all of its holdings halted; price discovery at -30% will be difficult, but it should be reasonable to come up with a strategy to sell as a stop-loss just before a 30% drawdown.",,

Torrenting will suddenly become as convenient for many (not all). The compromise being watching it on a PC/laptop without extra effort.

It really depends on the kind of user - which I'd put into 3 broad categories;

There are the ultra lazy that will just put anything semi appealing on - will probably stick to the subscriptions and add to the list over time. 

Then you've got the semi-active users that look for specific stuff, they currently have a few services and are the most likely to end up torrenting a few movies at a time because they can't find them or they're on another service they don't have/want. These are the users that are likely to fall off the edge into piracy and reduce the number of services they sub to.

Then you've got ""super users"" or ""old fashioned"" who'll have their Plex server setup tailored to their wants and needs and either torrent or rip DVD/Bluray still. These probably only share a subscription if that. This is definitely <5% of all users.

Of course those execs have probably assessed this as not a huge deal - but execs have been wrong in the past and will be wrong many times in the future.

But the EPA and government agencies might (might, seeing as how they are half neutered by industry anyways) care. The less public attention brought to the quantity of pollution the better, from their perspective.

> Nobody seems outraged or surprised by their claims though, so I dont see why I should be.

There have been quite a few studies about the increased frequency of suborbital flights that’s expected to occur in the coming decades, so there clearly is concern. It hasn’t really reached the mainstream because the industry is still fledgling.

> Sure, why not? Its not like Virgin invented some new type of fuel. They use a mixture of nitrous oxide and HTPB, like several other companies and countries that build and launch rockets.

Quite possible that’s true, I asked these questions as examples of what might be unknown to the general public or experts who would be able to make a more detailed scientific assessment of the possible impact.

> I'm just saying, you're making a mountain out of an ant hill. They don't really have any reason to lie about such a minor thing. Do you really think their business would suffer significantly if they emitted more CO2 or any other pollutant?

I don’t think the impact is as minor or inconsequential as you might think. I encourage you to research it if you’re interested but one prediction states:

> The findings, reported in a paper in press in Geophysical Research Letters1, suggest that emissions from 1,000 private rocket launches a year would persist high in the stratosphere, potentially altering global atmospheric circulation and distributions of ozone. The simulations show that the changes to Earth's climate could increase polar surface temperatures by 1 °C, and reduce polar sea ice by 5–15%.
https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101022/full/news.2010.558.html

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&#x200B;

I would recommend avoiding BTC until tether is fully audited and we know what companies that commercial paper is from.",ng3im3,The truth about tether and crypto prices

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

- 50% american stocks (market ETF)
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
- 15 % India (market ETF)
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
- 10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",ngamt2,Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):**

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement & Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President & CEO of DDC.",nh1ol9,Drone Delivery Canada selected by UBC for remote communities delivery initiative

>Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

>The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

>Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

>The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

>To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/oatly-is-said-to-price-ipo-at-top-of-range-with-markets-slumping

Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.",nhap36,Oatly Jumps in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",nhixq1,How will reopening affect Amazon?

800,,2021-05-21 13:36:56,t3_nhspuq,,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC.",nhv1rp,"Is supplying PPE directly to business the way forward for PPE providers in the US, EU?"

Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev would be $4 and 2x ev is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev would be $12 and at 2x ev would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!",nhvsxl,$LOTZ is this bottom for Carlotz? Or do we go lower? I think worth $4 to $24 over a few years.

Have you ever heard of the Norwegian State Fund?  No?  Not only is it the largest fund in the world, but it is also considered one of the most cleverly managed.  He has built a huge fortune from virtually nothing through constant, low-risk investing.  His strategy has proven itself over various market cycles and can certainly be a blueprint for private investors.  But how exactly did this come about and what has the fund done right in the past?

The story began in the 1960s when oil was first found off the coast of Norway.  From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  It only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil.",ni2sjd,Invest like the Norwegian Oil Fund

I gather that this risk minimizing effect as a result of diversification also leads to less exposure of swings in currencies (when buying instruments in currencies other than that of your home countrys). However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

Example:

\- Citizen in Denmark that has a local currency DKK  
\- Buys *iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF* (due to low 0.20% expense ratio) in USD

Would the above person cancel out the positive effects of diversification in regards to currency swings because he would now simply be subject to DKK/USD swings? Or is the entire premise wrong?",nir88v,Buying World Trackers in a Different Currency

823,,2021-05-23 14:34:29,t3_nj8yzp,,investing,"To help give the framework of my thought process, I'll use this example: 

-- I purchase $XYZ stock at a share price of $45.00/unit.    
-- $XYZ pays an annual dividend of 3.8%    
-- **For simplicity, let's assume the stock price holds at $45/unit for eternity with no dividend cuts or increases**    
-- Annual yield = 3.8% x $45.00 = $1.71/year

-- If I earn a return of $1.71/year, I should be able to recover my original principle price of $45/unit over time    
-- $45 / $1.71 = 26.31 years

Therefore, based on the above example, I would make the argument that in **26.31 years my annual dividend returns will total $45/unit based on an annual return of 3.8% without change in stock price.**

Is this line of thinking correct?    
Am I overlooking something simple?    
Will the same principle hold for 100 shares? 1,000 shares?

**If this is correct, then why don't we all invest in dividend stocks?** It seems if you are working on any type of 20+-year horizon there is the guarantee of the stock nearly paying for itself. This doesn't even mention the re-investment of dividends or the possibility of dividend increases over that period! _It almost seems to easy...?_

To save some time, I note these drawbacks/limitations to my line of thought:    
1) Dividends can be cut (and they often are!)    
2) Share price can be depressed, in turn impacting dividend yield potential significantly over time    
3) Stock dilution (seems unlikely as most dividend paying firms are stable/blue-chip type companies)    
4) Time in market (hypothesis needs a longer timeframe to play out)

With the increase of renewable energy power systems are gonna face an interesting problem: negative price. 

Negative price is the situation where there is a non flexible demand and a strong non flexible offer.

Basically they say that shorting is selling a currency pair, where the you expect the ""base"" currency to fall in value. For example, this breakdown by IG: https://www.ig.com/us/trading-strategies/learn-how-to-short-a-currency-190712

But that's the end of their explanation. How does merely selling a currency pair result in a profit? Where and when are you realizing a profit?

Say you start with $10,000 USD, you short the USD, and you're right and it falls in value during the relevant period. Where's your profit coming from in this scenario? Tangibly, how do you end up having more than $10,000 in the bank when it's over? 

For stocks, shorting is supposed to involve ""borrowing"" shares of stock, selling them, waiting for the drop, and then buying and returning the shares to whomever lended them to you. (I have no idea how one borrows shares of stock, but apparently it's a thing.) The explanations for shorting forex don't mention any comparable process of borrowing, selling, and re-buying the currency. So how do you profit in the forex case?

Regarding RH PFOF -

I noticed after Q3 of last year RH stopped reporting venue-specific information in their [Held NMS Stocks and Options Order Routing Public Report](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

In [Q4](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf) and [since](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf) any venue-specific information is all listed under Robinhood Securities LLC.

I'm not looking for any conspiracies I'm just wondering if there is some sort of loophole RH found in lack of necessity to list entity-specific execution services by using an umbrella company, or if SEC regulation changed.

It's a question purely out of curiosity, I was wondering since the [C&D](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf) settlement if it made public information specific toward particular stocks/assets with it's PFOF dependent on the service, i.e. if there were divisions dependent on certain assets/order types being directed or non-directed. (Directed meaning RH as customer as obviously it ~~isn't~~ wasn't necessarily a concern for it's actual customers until then).

My theory is that if RH does indeed have crypto holdings these orders would be of asset class that would not perhaps be sourced through a third party-executor.

**Edit:** The report discrepancies were between Robinhood Securities LLC - Held NMS Stocks & Robinhood Financial. This is the [2021 Q1 RH Securities](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf) report.

* That volatility has been on display in recent weeks as seen in crypto swings as evidenced in bitcoin's wild ride. This morning bitcoin rises to $37.6K but had dropped as low as $31.1K on Sunday.
* COIN stock rises 3.0% in premarket trading.
* Sets price target at $306; implies a 36% upside potential for stock based on Friday's closing price of $224.35.
* Nance also likes COIN's leverage to an ecosystem with strong growth driven by increasing adoption of digital currencies, its consumer platform with strong customer acquisition trends and rapidly growing institutional business, and its opportunities to add additional features and capabilities.
* Though the continued success or failure of crypto as an asset class will ultimately determine COIN's future, ""we believe COIN represents a blue-chip way through with to invest in the development of the ecosystem,"" the analyst writes.
* Points to COIN's careful approach to regulatory compliance, crypto-native technology stack, and role as an innovation hub for new crypto endeavors.
* Nance's Buy rating is more optimistic than the average SA Author's rating of Neutral (6 Bullish, 5 Neutral, 2 Bearish) and aligns with the average Wall Street rating of Bullish (6 Very Bullish, 1 Bullish, 4 Neutral).
* Last week, Coinbase snagged an Outperform rating at Wedbush helped by its ""first mover"" advantage.

But if investors are broadly concerned about inflation, it suggests stock prices are likely already reflecting these risks and investors have discounted, or priced in, inflation risk into the markets. While it may not be a perfect analog, it's worth considering what happened during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. 

On March 17, 2020, BofA's Global Fund Manager Survey identified ""Coronavirus"" as its biggest tail risk, and it remained on the top fo the list for the next 10 months as data consistently and persistently reflected an economy in a state of emergency. But the S&P 500 prices bottomed on March 23, 2020. 

In other words, the market had priced in the coronavirus recession and discounted the pandemic's worst financial impacts by mid-March, but this risk still remained the consensus worry among investors for another year. 

The threat of inflation is the most known risk in the markets right now. And so investors should consider the likelihood that the downside of inflation has been priced in.

""Unlike recent cycles, we acknowledge that inflation tail-risk is higher and that inflation data could get hotter before normalizing,"" JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said. ""This outcome, at the same time, is getting increasingly priced-in as essentially every investor we have spoken to in recent weeks is well aware of this backdrop.""

According to Google, search interest in ""inflation"" is at an all-time high. The University of Michigan's recent survey of consumers revealed sentiment got dinged in May due to unusually elevated concerns about inflation in the years to come.

On the corporate side, a record number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have discussed ""inflation"" on earnings calls as executives just can't stop talking about higher costs.

Whether or not inflation actually becomes a major problem for the economy will only be known in hindsight. And despite folks arguing that recent upticks in price represent ""transitory"" concerns and ""reopening quirks,"" this debate is likely to rage on for months especially as high-profile skeptics sound alarms.

# What to expect next

The issue of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to concern regulators in Europe and around the world. It will also lead to additional laws and regulations that will affect companies, particularly in the fields of energy, industry and manufacturing, and aviation.

[On May 24–25, the European Council will convene for a special meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2021/05/24-25/) to discuss the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further guidance on the issue. It is likely that the meeting will have an impact on the price of carbon.

[Analysts disagree about the rate of growth in the price of carbon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-europes-carbon-market-is-experiencing-a-boom-like-never-before.html), Some claim it will continue to climb throughout the year to levels of over 100 euros per tonne, and some claim it will stabilize at around 40 in the coming year but will grow slowly until it at least doubles by the end of the decade.

It is worth following the reports and new regulations from government bodies in Europe and around the world, and pay attention to any new regulation that will directly affect Carbon activity and price.

As a result of the jump in the price of carbon, it is likely that we will see changes in companies that produce gas emissions. Especially from the energy-production, and aviation sectors, as well as the growth of companies that offer greener solutions.

[In addition, last year, China, too, committed ](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-considers-going-carbon-neutral-peaking-emissions/)to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2060.

845,,2021-05-25 00:47:14,t3_nkcyw3,,investing," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

The only disadvantage I see with leveraged ETFs is extreme volatility and the fact that investments may take much longer to recover after a prolonged bear market.

Could it be that Tesla expectations of dominance are subtracting from the expected returns of these car companies? I am looking at Toyota for example, who were the early leaders in electric tech and are now focusing on a large new range of ev’s. Could TM be a great buy if I think they will catch up on the ev tech?

Lastly, with the expected switch to greener tech, any thoughts on silver? I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode, but I would love other investors opinions. Reasons for silver: 
Decreased supply: mined silver per year has been decreasing and it is very difficult to find silver mines (most silver is a by product from other mines). 
Increased demand: Green tech (eg solar panels and electric cars). Also increased investor focus (silver squeeze movement plus it is a traditional inflation hedge)
Silver has got a bad name due to some etfs like SLV not being backed by physical silver, but PSLV is legit (or I prefer buying it from my local coin store and keeping it in my possession)

Edit: My real question probably should be worded as: if Tesla is a bubble and they won’t take over everything, is this an opportunity for other car manufacturers.  Thanks all for detailed responses, great sub!",nlflvi,Thoughts on car companies P/E ratios? Most under 10 which seems really low to me

>  
>The success by activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 in getting at least two candidates on Exxon's board marks a big loss for the largest U.S. oil company, which incurred a $20 billion-plus loss in 2020 and has been slower to embrace lower-carbon investments than its global rivals. Exxon had sought to stave off investors aiming to reshape the board to better align the company with global moves to combat climate change.  
>  
>Two of Engine No. 1's board nominees, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, were elected to Exxon's board, with counting continuing.  
>  
>The dissident shareholder group led by Engine No. 1 put up a slate of four nominees to the 12-member Exxon board of directors at the shareholder meeting in the first big boardroom contest at an oil major that makes climate change the central issue.  
>  
>Exxon has lagged other oil majors in its response to climate change concerns, forecasting many more years of oil and gas demand growth and doubling down on investments to boost its output - in contrast to global rivals that have scaled back fossil fuel investments.  
>  
>That approach boosted the company's debt load by billions of dollars in recent years, leading to a record $22 billion loss in 2020 after years of underperformance.  
>  
>Governments and companies have moved to reduce emissions from fossil fuels that are warming the planet, and investors led by Engine No. 1 have said the changing world meant that CEO Darren Woods needed to make big changes to ensure Exxon's future value to investors.  
>  
>""It's a huge deal. It shows not just that there is more seriousness apparent in the thinking among investors about climate change, it's a rebuff of the whole attitude of the Exxon board,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director of ESG Research at MSCI.  
>  
>Woods had argued that Exxon's board understood the company's complexity and that Exxon supports a path toward carbon reductions in the Paris accord, referring to the international agreement aimed at combating climate change.  
>  
>However, in another signal of investor dissatisfaction with the company's approach to climate change, shareholders also approved measures calling on Exxon to provide more information on its climate and grassroots lobbying efforts.

>  
>Exxon had fought to keep climate activists at bay, spending tens of millions of dollars on a high-profile PR campaign, agreeing to publish more details of its emissions and coming out in support of carbon reduction.

Of course a business has an objective to generate profit. They need to do that so they can survive and grow, so there's no denying that as a fundamental purpose.

But the EPA and government agencies might (might, seeing as how they are half neutered by industry anyways) care. The less public attention brought to the quantity of pollution the better, from their perspective.

> Nobody seems outraged or surprised by their claims though, so I dont see why I should be.

There have been quite a few studies about the increased frequency of suborbital flights that’s expected to occur in the coming decades, so there clearly is concern. It hasn’t really reached the mainstream because the industry is still fledgling.

> Sure, why not? Its not like Virgin invented some new type of fuel. They use a mixture of nitrous oxide and HTPB, like several other companies and countries that build and launch rockets.

Quite possible that’s true, I asked these questions as examples of what might be unknown to the general public or experts who would be able to make a more detailed scientific assessment of the possible impact.

> I'm just saying, you're making a mountain out of an ant hill. They don't really have any reason to lie about such a minor thing. Do you really think their business would suffer significantly if they emitted more CO2 or any other pollutant?

I don’t think the impact is as minor or inconsequential as you might think. I encourage you to research it if you’re interested but one prediction states:

> The findings, reported in a paper in press in Geophysical Research Letters1, suggest that emissions from 1,000 private rocket launches a year would persist high in the stratosphere, potentially altering global atmospheric circulation and distributions of ozone. The simulations show that the changes to Earth's climate could increase polar surface temperatures by 1 °C, and reduce polar sea ice by 5–15%.

* The price of fossil fuels, especially oil, is extremely volatile, which only adds to the risk in loaning them money. A brand new oil well could look very profitable when they start to build it, but then become unprofitable by the time it's ready to start pumping oil out of the ground.

* ESG funds are increasingly powerful due to concern for climate change, so cutting them off in either loans or investment money (or both) is an easy way to boost their ESG score and help have more ESG money come into their stock.

Yes, 60% is the (target) daily max loss. The circuit break on SPY will halt *all* trading for the day at -20%, and UPRO will therefore halt at (around) -60%. This is partially the job of market makers, to find inefficiencies in the market and correct/exploit them. If SPY is trading at -15% DoD, and UPRO is trading below -45% DoD, there should exist sufficient buying pressure from market makers and other institutions to move the price closer to the true value of the ETFs holdings. This may not be exactly -45% (since UPRO’s holdings for the day may not be *exactly* tracking 3x SPY), but it should be close.

Note, however, that I stated *daily* max loss. UPRO should halt somewhere around -60%. Normally, it would be rebalanced at the end of the day; however, if the markets of its holdings are halted, it cannot be rebalanced, meaning you might be exposed to the *previous day’s* leverage the following day, leading to a “UPRO-to-0” scenario if the next day opens below -33% (relative to the previous-day’s open).

Tesla market share is decreasing in Europe because Europe has a high VAT tax on imports and Tesla currenrly has no production capabilities in Europe which is why Tesla has been heavily emphasizing the Berlin factory. I dont know how people like you do research but your entire premise is wrong. Tesla is in huge demand. They just have production limitations because unlike VW which has been in the game for many decades, Tesla is still relatively new in the grand scheme of things. Once they have the production issues sorted, they will dominate the industry. Look at how almost every vehicle they produced is sold. Does that seem to you to be a demand constraint? If the demand isn't there, why is Tesla so focused on creating a new production plant that is expected to be one of the largest auto manufacturing plant in the world?",,

The airlines might even make more profits,  as long as all if them didn't try to race to the bottom and gain more market share and more profit.

2. Electricity can be a renewable energy. Gasoline isn't.
3. EV's are much easier to maintain because they have fewer moving parts. No oil changes and because there are fewer parts = easier to repair the more available EV's are in the market.
4. EV's will eventually be cheaper to own and purchase than ICE vehicles.
5. You can charge your EV at your home. This means unless you are traveling 300+ miles per day everyday, you will never have to visit a supercharger or charging station outside of the one in your home. 
6. There will be many charging stations opening up to replace gas stations once EV's become more popular. It's only a matter of time before ICE vehicles are obsolete.
7. You don't need to wait an hour to charge your vehicle. That's if you want maximum capacity in terms of charging your vehicle. Most EV's can charge to 80% capacity within 10-15 minutes. Plus, most charging stations are expected to be in commercial areas where people do their shopping such as supermarkets, shopping centers, etc., 

Of course, there are pros to ICE vehicles but right now, the environmental impact of ICE vehicles is why EV's are the best option for the foreseeable future.
