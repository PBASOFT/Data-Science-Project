‚Ä¢ Previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients showed that the nasally administered Foralumab is well-tolerated with no apparent severe adverse events (SAEs) when dosed for up to 10 consecutive days. Results from these studies showed strong anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment regimen.

New York/London, 25 May 2021 ‚Äì Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (‚ÄúTiziana‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, is pleased to announce that the first patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was dosed with nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Nasal Foralumab 50 mcg (25 mcg/nostril) will be administered in 3-week cycles, with 3 times/week dosing for the first 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest period. This first-ever clinical study in SPMS patients, under an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND, will continue for six months to evaluate routine safety, tolerability, and neurological behaviors. The study will also examine microglial activation, by positron emission tomography (PET), immunological and neurodegenerative markers to assess clinical responses following the treatment regimen.
Previously, Tiziana completed a Phase 1 trial of a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) once a day dosing for 5 consecutive days with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy subjects. The treatment was well-tolerated with no drug-related safety issues reported at doses of up to 250 mcg.

Subsequently, Tiziana reported positive data from the clinical study with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for consecutive 10 days was well-tolerated and there were no apparent severe adverse events. The clinical results demonstrated that the treatment provided significant reduction of lung inflammation together with a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), biomarkers of inflammation, in the blood samples taken from patients ( https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil)

Dr. Howard Weiner, Robert Kroc Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School said, ‚ÄúNasally administered anti-CD3 is an exciting,¬†novel approach that has the ability to provide safe treatment for a form of MS that currently has no effective treatment. We are excited to examine this first-in-class approach to treat patients with SPMS for whom no effective treatment option is currently available.‚Äù
Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and senior neurologist at the BWH, adds, ‚ÄúEffective and targeted treatments for progressive MS are urgently needed. Nasal Foralumab could revolutionize treatment for this disabling form of disease.‚Äù ¬†

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2Œ≥c-/-), it was shown that whilst targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
About Tiziana Life SciencesTiziana Life Sciences plc is a dual listed (NASDAQ: TLSA, UK LSE: TILS) biotechnology company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel molecules to treat human diseases in oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. In addition to Milciclib, the Company will be shortly initiating Phase 2 studies with orally administered Foralumab for Crohn‚Äôs Disease and nasally administered Foralumab for progressive multiple sclerosis. Foralumab is the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (‚ÄúmAb‚Äù) in clinical development in the world. This Phase 2 compound has potential application in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn‚Äôs Disease, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes (‚ÄúT1D‚Äù), inflammatory bowel disease (‚ÄúIBD‚Äù), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where modulation of a T-cell response is desirable. The Company is accelerating development of anti-Interleukin 6 receptor (‚ÄúIL6R‚Äù) mAb, a fully human monoclonal antibody for treatment of IL6-induced inflammation, especially for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'ApEs StIcK tOgEtHeR' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",The Difference In A Trading Structure And A Trading System,,

We believe it would be the key growth catalysis for its Amazon Prime subscription and possibly impact deeply into its advertisement business.

**What is Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. - MGM**

https://preview.redd.it/bbpcu3nvu9171.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70a005edee2d9e4202999eac2a53c89eb66ca8db

If you don't recall what MGM is, the photo above should ring some bells by now. MGM is one of Hollywood's most famous movie producers, with its lion logo at the beginning of every movie that they made. It includes James Bond, Rocky, recently Tomb Raider, and A Star is Born.

&#x200B;

For most people, that means if the e-commerce giant successfully acquires MGM, all those movies will be on Amazon Prime Video on demand. It is good for all those prime users, including myself.

**What Does It Mean To An Investor**

https://preview.redd.it/cjegnzmzu9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5ff2bdd7a6915615c340b50545f72cdaea5bff

Amazon already has Prime Video, why they still need to buy another one you might ask. It buys talented movie makers instead of buying a company. However, this pandemic gave both Amazon and MGM a second thought. For MGM, they are unable to release movies in theaters. In fact, they have already sold some of their movies to streaming services. The pandemic hit the movie industry very badly. On the other hand, Amazon has a hard time making some successful movie in-house. If you don‚Äôt believe it, can you name one movie that it has made? Still, they are one of the biggest streaming service providers.

**Amazon Prime**

https://preview.redd.it/9m1581i3v9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=837149ff148ec751bf413bda5d03fa8fb3149a74

In 2021, there are around 150 million Amazon Prime users in the US, and most of the people join the membership because it offers free one-day shipping locally. This is followed by the second is for the Amazon Prime Video. It's total revenue for the quarter ending 31 March 2021 was almost $110 billion, over 40% increased year over year. If all 150 million Prime members stayed for one year, it contributed over 17 billion. That would be 15% of the company's total revenue. If more than half of the people join Prime because of its streaming service, we believe the acquisition of MGM would boost the Prime subscription number to a new high.

The $9 billion seems too much for acquiring a company studio. However, if you compared the $11 billion spent on video and music content in 2019; the cost of the first season Lord of the Rings series ($465 million), the acquisition now would be considered as a very good deal for Amazon.

**The Advertisement Network**

Compared with Facebook or Google, the Amazon advertisement network is still very small. However, the potential is hard to ignore. Amazon's advertisement business is generating nearly $7 billion in just a quarter and it keeps growing, it is nearly 80% growth from last year. MGM not only put movies into the theater, but it also has a global-based TV network. The acquisition of MGM would give amazon the tool to test out their advertising serving or targeting capabilities and reach more potential Amazon Prime users worldwide.

**Amazon Web Services - AWS**

For most people, Amazon is just an e-commerce company. However, every investor should know, it is much more than that. Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS, is the biggest cloud service provider worldwide. In fact, this website is being hosted on AWS. AWS delivered over $13 billion in revenue, contributing over 12% of the total revenue. Amazon Prime Video is steaming from AWS which means it can also help Amazon to lower the taxable income by deducting the cost of using AWS services. However, we believe the cloud services growth rate would be slower, yet AWS would remain the dominant company of cloud computing services.

**Overweight**

Amazon is gaining more share in e-commerce due to the pandemic. The cloud services would be the new cash cow, money-making machine, and the Prime Video is believed to drive the Prime subscription number to a new high.",My thought about Amazon MGM acquisition,,
9,2021-05-25 14:27:10,t3_nkr0vt,nkr0vt,StockMarket,"I was wondering if there was a way to use SHAP values when looking at macroeconomic indicators. My first assumption was to see which breakeven rates best predicts inflation via SHAP values and see if there are times when it changes (times when short term breakeven rates dictate inflation vs times when long term breakeven rates dictate inflation). But the problem is that breakeven rates usually referencing a future tenor and I can only analyze ex-post which kind of works against the idea of forecasting (for example the current 1yr breakeven rate references inflation 1yr from now so I would have to a wait for 1 year's worth of inflation data to come out to test the results). 

So my next question was to try to match the returns, they may have similar volatility / variance during times and now I can analyze indicators such as breakeven rates and forward inflation expectation rates. But then I was thinking again and indicators like CPI or PCE aren't quoted as frequently as breakeven rates or forward inflation expectation rates so I don't think the returns will match up.

I was wondering if there are any other macroeconomic indicators or indexes that I could look at where I analyze them via SHAP values. I was thinking about looking at treasury rates and then analyzing the SHAP values with the same features. Any feedback or ideas would be much appreciated.",Using SHAP values within macroeconomic indicators,,

Huge debt isn't always a bad thing, especially in a near zero interest rate economy, and no debt isn't always a good thing. EPS and revenue may be skewed by the one off sale of a property, or some substantial tax write off. There's no single ratio or metric I can look at to say, if this, then buy; it's going to vary wildly from sector to sector and even company to company.

In all, I'm generally not concerned by liabilities, especially if they've shown an ability to pay them down, or have the cash on hand to start doing so.

üì∑[**benryker** 06:54 PM](https://www.reddit.com/user/benryker) Are you familiar with forex?

**May 23**

üì∑[**Midweek-Meltdown** 09:14 AM](https://www.reddit.com/user/Midweek-Meltdown) of course, please get to the point. I'm all for a bit of fore play but the suspense is dwindling

üì∑[**benryker** 11:49 AM](https://www.reddit.com/user/benryker) I work with a trading platform where after trading 7days your profit will be made available for withdrawals into your bank account or crypto wallet respectively With an average deposit I can assure you making 595% of the amount you trade with within seven days of trading

üì∑[**Midweek-Meltdown** 06:28 PM](https://www.reddit.com/user/Midweek-Meltdown) so I give you money and then 7 days later you give me a 595% profit? you are

A) the greatest trader in the world

B) your platforms business model is terrible and you are loosing money daily and will be bankrupt in no time

or

C) this is a scam.

Also looking through your comment history it looks like you push doge quite heavily which leads me to believe your maybe scam has something to do with the dogga. Not gonna lie, I see you've been awarded a hugz award and also have enough karma to post on my favorite subreddits which makes me sad and jealous, I will make it one day I guess. Just out of interest what made you target me with this great opportunity?",Guess my amazing opportunity was rescinded :(,,

Wondering why the fuck after Covid went so down compared to the rest of our Ameriape and Eurotard Airlines? Answer's simple, motherfuckers went bankrupt.

It results that they ended up being tossed away from the NASDAQ resulting in an impotent untradeable position, However a hero diamond handed named Roberto Alvo bought back the company in April 2020.

Why the fuck did it take so long for it to go back and why is it skyrocketing now? Answer's simple:

Covid did hit very strongly in SouthAmerica and at first they lacked vaccines and had plenty of restrictions for traveling, now they are getting a bunch of fucking vaccines, travel restrictions are being removed and tickets are being sold out! Yes retards that's correct, tickets are being sold out!

It is just a matter of time for this stock to go incredibly damn up, by the end of the year we might see a 500% return, but that's just for the basic trader, WE APES ARE DIFFERENT.

IT DOES NOT MATTER IF WE BUY IT OR NOT, EITHER WAY IS GOING ALL THE FUCKING WAY UP,

DON'T BELIEVE ME? DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, CHECK ITS MARKET VOLUME, THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST UNDERRATED BULLISH STOCK THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN, GOT ONE BETTER? FUCKING SEND IT.

GO GET A FUCKING CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE, TELL YOUR WIFE TO FUCK OFF, GET DRUNK AND GO ALL THE FUCKING WAY ALL IN, WE WANNA SEE THOSE 2000% RETURNS AT LEAST, WE WANNA CATCH THIS ROCKET ALL TOGETHER BEFORE IT REACHES ANOTHER GALAXY.

I wish I coulda found this way before, we Americans do ignore a lot of distinct markets alien to us.

PLEASE HELP WITH RESEARCH AND CRITICISM! I WANNA SEE THOSE YOLO CALLS ASAP,

82,2021-05-25 19:43:41,t3_nky9ga,nky9ga,StockMarket,"ROCK HILL, S.C., May 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --¬†3D Systems¬†(NYSE:DDD) today announced the addition of four new high-performance, production-capable resins to its Figure 4¬Æ¬†portfolio designed specifically for both batch-run, end-use part manufacturing, and prototyping applications. The company has added¬†Figure 4 High Temp 150C FR Black,¬†Figure 4 Tough 65C Black,¬†Figure 4 Tough 60C White, and¬†Figure 4 Rigid Gray¬†that, unlike typical photopolymer resins, feature long-term mechanical performance and stability in indoor and outdoor environments and are suitable for highly complex applications in industries such as consumer electronics, automotive and motorsports, healthcare, industrial goods, and aerospace and defense. These materials are the latest additions to the company‚Äôs existing portfolio of Figure 4 high-speed, production-capable 3D printing materials that include rigid, tough, durable, elastomeric, and high heat deflection temperature (HDT). Unlike technologies such as powder binding or fused deposition modeling (FDM), Figure 4 parts feature a similar out-of-printer appearance to injection-molded plastics, with smooth, glossy surfaces and no visible build lines, thus requiring less post-finishing.

Additionally, the company‚Äôs latest release of its renowned¬†3D Sprint¬Æ¬†software enables high-density part stacking and new strut support structures, which facilitates a 40% improvement in productivity. The complete solution ‚Äì including the company‚Äôs Figure 4 materials and technology, software, and applications expertise ‚Äì helps 3D Systems‚Äô customers deliver batch runs of tens or even hundreds-of-thousands of high-performance, end-use plastic parts.

Novel Material for High HDT, Flame Retardant Applications
Figure 4 High Temp 150C FR Black is a rigid, halogen-free, fire retardant resin ideal for production plastic parts for aerospace and defense, automotive and motorsports, and consumer electronics applications. This material is UL94 V0 rated at 2mm or 3mm thickness for electrical components and printed circuit board covers and housings. It is also compliant with U.S. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 25.853 and FAR Part 23.853 at 3mm thickness, and can be used to produce rigid covers, panels, housings, and small in-cabin parts for transport and commuter aircraft. This material is easy to handle and can be used as supplied without melting or printing at elevated temperatures.

Parts produced with Figure 4 High Temp 150C FR Black delivered mechanical performance and environmental stability for eight years of indoor and one and a half years outdoor per ASTM D4329 and ASTM G194 methods. This environmental stability ensures printed parts remain functional and stable for prolonged durations in indoor and outdoor environments.

Tough, ABS-like Materials for High Load-bearing Production Applications
3D Systems is complementing its Figure 4 portfolio with additional materials uniquely designed to deliver a combination of impact strength, elongation, and tensile strength. Additionally, these materials are engineered for long-term indoor and outdoor mechanical performance and environmental stability. All Figure 4 materials are capable of producing parts with excellent surface quality, accuracy, and repeatability without the need for a secondary thermal cure. The result is faster throughput to part-in-hand.

‚Ä¢Figure 4 Tough 65C Black possesses high elongation at yield (6.6%) which delivers better snaps and clips. This makes it ideal for applications such as brackets, covers, snap fits, structural and load-bearing parts, and custom fasteners. This material delivers long-term indoor and outdoor stability ‚Äì for eight years and one and a half years, respectively ‚Äì positioning it for applications such as automotive and consumer goods parts that must remain functional and stable in indoor and outdoor environments. Figure 4 Tough 65C Black is biocompatible-capable per ISO 10993-5 and is UL94 HB rated for flammability.

‚Ä¢Figure 4 Tough 60C White, similar in overall performance to the Tough 65C Black, is engineered to address mechanical-load bearing applications such as small snap-fits, brackets, handles and fasteners in consumer products, wearable devices, and general use parts that require details, and accuracy. This material is biocompatible-capable per ISO 10993-5 and ISO 10993-10 and can be sterilized using common methods while maintaining its mechanical properties, color, cytotoxicity, and dimensional stability. This makes it an ideal material to produce tools, handles, and small plastic parts designed for medical uses.

Figure 4 Rigid Gray for Static Production Applications
Figure 4 Rigid Gray, similar in overall performance to the previously announced PRO BLK 10 material, demonstrates capabilities for both functional prototyping and end-use part production thanks to its balance of thermal and mechanical properties, combined with excellent print quality, long-term indoor and outdoor mechanical performance and environmental stability. This material is ideal for static rigid housing and covers, casings, panels, and trim. The gray color is helpful for visualization of text, texture, and fine details for functional prototyping. The color also makes this material suitable for secondary processes such as painting and metal plating.

This material is already demonstrating value for 3D Systems‚Äô customers. ‚ÄúWe are using the Figure 4 Rigid Gray material to rapidly deliver functional parts for our consumer sporting goods lines, including ski helmet accessories, bicycle lighting covers, and sporting shoe soles and components,‚Äù said Gr√©goire Mercusot, material engineer, Decathlon. ‚ÄúWe are very impressed with the performance of this material and the overall productivity of the Figure 4 solution. Out of the printer, parts display excellent dimensional accuracy and perfect quality, comparable to injection-molded plastics. The attractive grey color of the material is also ideal for highlighting fine surface details and texture-on-part.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur customers lead their industries in innovation, and they are turning to us for support with increasingly complex applications,‚Äù said Dr. Edwin Hortelano, senior vice president, materials engineering & development, 3D Systems. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not only partnering with our customers to help them design the optimal solution to meet their application challenges, but in many cases, we are also developing new materials that deliver the unique mechanical properties required. Our materials scientists created these latest enhancements for our Figure 4 portfolio to help our customers produce parts that not only enhance performance but improve productivity. The combination of materials, 3D printing technology, software, and deep applications expertise allows 3D Systems to deliver industry-leading additive manufacturing solutions that accelerate time-to-market and enable competitive advantage.‚Äù

General availability of these materials is planned for the middle of June 2021. For more information on 3D Systems‚Äô complete plastic materials portfolio, please visit the company‚Äôs website.

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor‚Äôs said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts‚Äô expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation ‚Äî rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago ‚Äî the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be ‚Äúmostly temporary‚Äù and that the Fed was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be ‚Äúoverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.‚Äù 

**Highlights**

* [U.S. new home sales pulled back less than expected in April over March,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-fell-5-140851441.html) even as rising prices, tight inventory began to ripple through the housing market. New home sales fell by 5.9% in April over the previous month, giving back some of March's 7.4% gain, [the Commerce Department said Tuesday](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Consensus economists were looking for a drop of 7%
* The Washington DC‚Äôs Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***

Nevertheless, this isn't a ""status of that sub"" post, and wanted to share the results of something interesting I did that involves stocks.

I built an algorithm that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across just the WallStreetBets sub (weighted by upvotes, etc.) -- rebalanced monthly. The strategy involves analyzing stocks and conducting sentiment analyses on their mentions to buy or sell. There's a healthy amount of $GME and $AMC, some $SPCE, some $NVDA, and 13 other stocks.

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an **annualized return of 26%** (compared to 16% for the SP500)

&#x200B;

\- **Max drawdown** of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an \[investopedia link\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp)) for those of you that can read

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

\- Avg win of 0.85%

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

Gold is doing good and definitely not having big drops. If I had a dime outside of crypto to bet, I'd bet some huge regulation news is coming. I'd imagine true crypto investors that have been in for nearly a decade or longer are sick to their stomachs right now. The whole point of this is deregulation and allowing the small investor to make money, but it's now abundantly clear that the same whales manipulating the stock market are now taking part in crypto and destroying something that was awesome. Then regulations will come under the guise of ""protecting the little investor"" when it actually moves the goalposts insanely in the whale's favor. 
It's just really hard for me to fathom how every single coin simultaneously plummets. It let's me know very few people hold the majority of all coins and they're in every single coin, even the shit coins. Moving forward, we all need to write down goals and targets that we pull at least 50% profit if not 70%. At any moment the rug can be pulled out from under us, regardless if your coin choose is good or not. 

Idk about y'all but I've missed out on at least 25k this year by just holding and waiting for the big surge.. here's the secret though.. even if it has a big surge it still corrects and allows us to jump back in. 

And now I not only missed out on that 25k, but I'm back at square fucking one. Before I at least had 100-150% gains that were staying, so I kept telling myself, ""I don't need to pull any profits it will keep going up"".. I still believe that it will in the long run, but I'd love to have that 25k I missed by not pulling.

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

3. Music stops for Silver and Gold alternatives :

China opens its borders for gold imports. ( supportive for silver action )

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Chinese Social media platform pointed out that some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable than crytpocurrencies 

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives for cyrptocurrencies  .

Who remembers the feeling when you road trip to a NEW destination...  90 km feels an eternity, and that you'll never get there.  But once you arrive at destination, the travel doesn't feel as long anymore.  This is what you felt in a correction.  You have arrived. 

Still too complicated for many .

4. Big adds from SLV and PSLV this month the first after February almost 15 million ozz per month this is 2 % increase in total ETFS . Somebodies almost see the light

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5i7gg6mny071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0310b3b90029e9cf3152efae289c5293865baa

&#x200B;

 

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vqaldu9ony071.png?width=3211&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a43b35690ed6091d664048f4f0b262537c3bc05

 

6. Modeled Gold Price:

CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rokba99qny071.png?width=3228&format=png&auto=webp&s=8266ba12aaeca17f9f9b6c0a7eada8e2fefc710c

 

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wcx3jbsny071.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2500d8f5c1539c5a13d9eb9dc944fc11455a557

 

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : This is normally the best silver investment type if you can find with reasonable premiums .Nowadays the premiums are sky high due to reddit silver enhusiasm so for most late comers almost it is over . Spot at $27.65. Some internet sites selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.

&#x200B;

2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .

3. ZSƒ∞L ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At least 10 /20 % silver add to your portfolios as hedges and don't miss out this once a time opportunity .

Lastly :

The fact that I'm seeing so few cheerleaders getting giddy about the upside in precious metals and miners is a welcome positive for further gains  in the weeks and months ahead imho.

How to beat the market is one of the hottest topics among investment professionals and retail investors. Beating the market is like winning the NBA championship, it puts a halo on the investor or analyst. During my research, it seems like almost all open sources talk about the ability to pick outperforming stocks as the most important factor in a market-beating strategy. As a finance professional, a former trader at an investment bank, I‚Äôm telling you that is not true and there are many other strategies that can help you to beat the market, even if you don‚Äôt know how to pick stocks. Moreover, stock-picking isn‚Äôt for everybody because it is very time-consuming and requires extensive knowledge in finance. In this article, I will explain the pros and cons for a retail investor to focus on picking stocks and one of the many other methods, I personally use, that can help you to beat the market without picking stocks. 

**How hard is it to beat the market?**

According to Forbes, a study by Vanguard, an American investment company with AUM over 6 trillion dollars, found that only 18% of active mutual fund managers beat their benchmarks over a 15-year period. Of these outperforming managers, 97% of them experienced underperformance for at least 5 years, more than 60% experienced 7 or more years of underperformance, and 66% of these star managers underperformed for 3 or more consecutive years. These managers are highly educated, have many years of experience in the financial markets, working over 10 hours a day, it is very surprising to see only a small fraction of fund managers can beat the market in the long term and this fact also tells us how hard it is to beat the market consistently.

**Why stock-picking is not for everybody?**

First, compare yourself to these active mutual fund managers and ask yourself the following questions: are you smarter than them? Can you work harder than them? Do you have more knowledge about the financial market than them? If most of these managers cannot beat the market, why can you? Stock-picking requires a lot of time and industry knowledge. For an average retail investor, assuming this investor has a full-time job, it is very hard to find the time to learn and perform due diligence in order to screen for potential outperforming stocks unless this investor has 48 hours in a day and gets free RedBulls.

Secondly, diversification can be tough for retail investors who try to pick stocks for their portfolios. If an investor wants to reduce his or her portfolio risk by diversification, he or she will have to sacrifice some returns because risk and expected return generally have a positive relationship. If the investor decides to have more concentrated positions to boost up the return, then his or her portfolio risk will go up as well. For example, imagine you have $10,000 to invest, how many holdings are you going to have in your portfolio? 3 or 10? If you choose to hold only 3 stocks, your portfolio risk is probably through the roof, and you should be ready for it. If you choose to hold 10 stocks, do you have the time and energy to perform due diligence on these 10 companies and follow their every action? My point is, holding single names is not the optimal way to construct portfolios for retail investors who lack time and financial backgrounds.

**What should we do?**

In my opinion, broad-market index ETFs, such as SPY, are better for the kind of investor that I mentioned above. But you might ask, how can you beat the market by buying the market if we assume S&P 500 is our benchmark? The answer is to hold SPY and sell covered calls.

**What is a covered call?**

A covered call is a strategy where an investor sells call options and owns an equivalent amount of the underlying asset. For example, you have 100 shares of SPY and sell 1 contract of SPY call (1 contract = 100 shares).

Let me briefly explain how options are priced. Generally, we can explain option pricing based on the following formula:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a0qatxh7h2171.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd2e93c18884ea7a5ebbf527cd9747c57bf0021

Don‚Äôt be frightened by this giant formula. All you need to know are the factors that impact the price of a call option:

1. Spot price of the stock: the higher the spot price, the higher the price of a call option

2. Strike price: the lower the strike price, the higher the price of the call option

3. Time to maturity: the longer the time to maturity, the higher the price

4. Volatility of the stock: the higher volatility, the higher the price

One thing that we need to pay attention to is when the spot price exceeds the strike price of the call option, our shares get taken away. So, this strategy puts a cap on our potential returns but reduces our portfolio risk at the same time, remember the price of the call falls when the underlying stock falls, and we are shorting the call options meaning we gain when the price of the call falls. Therefore, the key to this strategy is to choose a strike price that can both maximize our return and have a reasonably low probability of getting exceeded. A pay-off diagram for covered call strategy is shown below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/61scxtcch2171.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6ede26272c416caa1954ffc75eaf1290277de5

**How does the strategy work?**

Let me demonstrate the application of this strategy with a real-life example.

https://preview.redd.it/yivme2jgh2171.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=3000096b043c95d11bbd880be9f70d2f888e2805

The above call options expire on January 21, 2022, which is approximately 8 months from now. If we buy 100 shares of SPY at the current spot price, $416.97/share, and sell a call option contract at 10 cents/contract with a strike price of 575, your portfolio return on the day of expiry would be the return on SPY + 10 cents x 100 shares if the spot price of SPY does not go above the strike price.

Choosing the right strike price is the key to this strategy because the strike price has to exceed the amount of management fee charged by SPY and maximize your result. The way I do it is to analyze the following 2 scenarios:

1. Normal stance

The market is in an upward trend and has not experienced any big corrections in the past 12 months. The chart should look like the following. 

https://preview.redd.it/0o5dhbvnh2171.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=649b8a84d7c3297628b6823fdddff87201ebbacc

 In this scenario, I would choose to sell the call option with a strike price that is equal to 10% (annualized return of SPY) plus 5% (I choose 5% as my ‚Äòbuffer‚Äô because I would be happy to sell SPY 5% above the annualized return, it can vary based on investor‚Äôs expectation), above the current spot price. If we take the current spot price of $416.97 and add 15%, it will give me $479.52 which rounds to $480. The highlighted call option in the image below has a strike price of 480 and expires on June 17, 2022, which is approximately one year from now. The premium for this specific call option is $6.25, which is approximately 1.50% of the current spot price of SPY. 

https://preview.redd.it/vvb9rxirh2171.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=768df8085fdc7dcfc4baaf9b7f25a2c2c38d0944

 According to Yahoo Finance, SPY charges an annual management fee of 0.09%. So, we take 1.50% that we earn from selling the call option and minus the 0.09% charged by SPY, then we have 1.41% left. 

https://preview.redd.it/ewi3y9tth2171.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6045ea096902020b94d00df96a34c795a9e8893

 Remember, we still must deduct trading fees charged by the broker in order to calculate the final return. For the broker I use, they charge me $10/trade plus $10/contract, which is $20 in total for this trade. The return that we make from selling this call option is 416.97/share x 100 shares x 1.41% = $587.94. So, in the end, we can make $587.94 - $20 = $567.94, which is 1.36%. So, if the spot price of SPY does not exceed 480 on June 17, 2022, our portfolio will outperform S&P 500 by 1.36% (assume the tracking error of SPY is near 0). Do you think 1.36% is too little? Let me show you how much value an extra 1.36% return can add to your portfolio. 

https://preview.redd.it/3fkksgwvh2171.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=137487278556cbb7d3a9533dffbe6d76846078a5

https://preview.redd.it/tkuhmfkyh2171.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0514095b47fb57ef3642044ae9ea5ffbf3723f8

2. Recovering stance

The market is recovering from a sharp drop. The chart should look like the following. 

https://preview.redd.it/1biky3a1i2171.png?width=276&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f1490f15ae533d2c3eda55480ba9af72fa5b89a

If this happens, just like in March 2020 when the COVID outbreak started, I will hold my positions and perhaps buy more with the money I made from selling call options previously. If my call options happen to expire during this downturn, I would not roll into new expiries because the strength of rebound is hard to predict. Again, we want to minimize the chance that the spot price goes above the strike price.

**Conclusion**

By using the covered-call strategy on broad-market index ETF like SPY, you will have a higher probability of beating the market than picking stocks and lower your portfolio risk at the same time. The only time that you will underperform the market is when the market is stronger than you expect, meaning the spot price at expiry exceeds the strike price.

But let me be clear, this is not a perfect strategy. As I mentioned above, a risk to this strategy is your potential return being limited by the strike price you choose. Another thing that we need to keep in mind, option prices vary from time to time due to changes to the factors that I mentioned previously. With that being said, the return is not guaranteed.

Hopefully, this article can help you become the ‚Äòmarket beater‚Äô that you always dream of.

157,2021-05-24 13:23:05,t3_njxvcd,njxvcd,StockMarket,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/hbqazq6ek2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=74eadb25a157f0eb06f2fc177ca21eeecf52b40b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?**

https://preview.redd.it/y5euumxfk2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50fa2852db7a4ff3c648499fab4149dd23f5187

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/nsplxyohk2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=db044c0fd63d2bf2396e095e5bc306489204a4d4

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/eze2j12jk2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0351d45013eb9bb4be06a43ac2e4ef1254d23088

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/54n0nmokk2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb67253b4c9c050b28642e9dfeca09379d9bc66a

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

I'm quite confident that people who buy 10m dollars worth of a specific stock with plans to own it for multiple decades do not want to own it through the Street Name brokerage as it adds to the risk of what to do if brokerage itself financially fails. Super wealthy probably don't want to bother with paper certificates either as it is cumbersome and outdated. The final option that google told me is the so called Direct Stock Purchase Plans, but those are usually used for employees of the companies and they constantly get bad reviews for how not easy it is to work with them. So the question is then, how do the ultra-rich buy stocks for the long term?? The only option comes to mind is that they have their own brokerages owned by them and registered with SEC, and they buy stocks directly this way. Does anyone know anything about this topic?

I am researching this topic for awhile as it bothers me how leveraged and abstract trading became with derivatives upon derivatives and especially ETFs that do not enforce ownership of 100% of underlying assets. One day ETFs will not represent all the stocks they were suppose to represent and risk will lie on brokerages.

BlackBerry is in the process of transforming itself from a hardware company to a software company. Back in the day, BlackBerry was once a dominating player in the smartphone industry but soon their market share had been taken by Android and iPhone. Since then, the company has been struggling and trying to transform its business strategy to be software-focused. Today, 98% of BlackBerry‚Äôs revenue comes from software and services, comparing to only 3% in 2014. During this transformation, their revenue and profits have been declining year over year, its profitability has been shredded into pieces. The company has just released its 2020 results and showed that its revenue and profitability have deteriorated once again, with revenue declined by 14% comparing with the previous year and a loss of $1.97 per share. The market is so bearish on the stock but we think otherwise, this might be the darkest before the dawn.

QNX

BlackBerry QNX is a real-time operating system (RTOS). RTOS is an operating system that serves real-time applications with real-time data. It‚Äôs targeted to solve problems as it goes. The difference between RTOS and traditional OS that we are using daily, such as iPhone IOS, Windows, and Android is that RTOS will not crash if something goes wrong with the system. For example, when the Windows operating system encounters an error, it will shut itself down and gives us a blue screen. If an RTOS runs into the same problem, it will bypass it and won‚Äôt shut itself down. This is useful in many applications, such as autonomous driving. Imagine your car‚Äôs operating system shuts down while self-driving, the result can be catastrophic. 

The EV market, as we all know, is growing rapidly. According to IHS Markit, the total sales of EV globally is around 2.5 million cars in 2020 and they expect it to grow by 70% in 2021. They also said global sales will top 12.2 million cars in 2025, indicating annual growth of nearly 52% (compounded). By 2021, China and Europe will account for the largest market shares, with China at about 44% and Europe at about 28%. Then North America with 16% and a combined share of 11% for Japan and South Korea. The EV market and autonomous driving technology seem to be growing together, autonomous driving features are more common in EVs than traditional cars. And the amount of effort and money required to develop a reliable operating system is too much, that many automakers will consider adopting an existing platform like the QNX rather than developing their own. With that being said, the user base of the QNX operating system will increase exponentially as the EV market grows.

The QNX operating system doesn‚Äôt just work on cars, it can also work on smart home appliances and even smart city infrastructures. As of today, there are more than 175 million cars on roads that use the QNX operating system. 

Ivy

BlackBerry Ivy is a cloud-connected software platform, joined force with Amazon‚Äôs AWS, that allows automakers to create personalized experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with QNX and AWS technology. In simple terms, this is a data-collecting platform that collects vehicle and driving data from all cars operating under QNX. This is a very powerful service that can help BlackBerry‚Äôs partners make better products and improve sales. BlackBerry‚Äôs plan is to roll it out sometime in 2022.

Spark

BlackBerry Spark is a product that utilizes AI, machine learning, and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention. Cybersecurity is the company‚Äôs strength and the market is growing at a high speed. According to Forbes, the global cybersecurity market is currently worth $173 billion in 2020, and growing to $270B by 2026 (7.2% annual growth rate). We expect it to grow faster than 7.2%, given we are more dependent on the internet and computers than ever, and frictions between nations are getting worse. The recent SolarWinds incident has rung the warning bell to all of us, cybersecurity is crucial for every nation, business, and individual.

Sale of Patent

BlackBerry is selling patents that are no longer relevant to them. We think this is a good move by the management. Recycling some of the capital and resources and put it somewhere more productive. The CEO, John Chen, said in the earnings call that they are in talks to sell some of their hardware and wireless network patents to a North American party and the deal is likely to go through in 2021. 

Conclusion

Despite the declining revenue and EPS, we are optimistic about BlackBerry. We need to keep in mind that the company is undergoing a complete transformation, from a hardware focus to a software focus, the management has been great at executing their plan. The company has positioned itself in 2 of the fast-growing industries, EV and cybersecurity, both as industry leaders with good market share. We expect BlackBerry‚Äôs growth to pick up in 2022 and onwards.

Our style

We are focusing on long-term investments with a time horizon of 5 years or longer. We care more about future growth potential than current valuations. BlackBerry is a long-term play and we expect it to yield exceptional returns once the transformation is complete.

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://imgur.com/a/ur3npx5)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

\- I plan on buying $100 every Sunday (worst performing day for BTC).

\- I will only buy below the 50MA. If price on a given Sunday is above, then I will rollover those $100 to the next Sunday, or until price goes under the 50MA.

\- I'll buy $200 instead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 25%.

\- I'll buy $400 isntead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 50%. I've found that BTC's deepest dips are around that price level.

EDIT: This is for long term investing, not swing trading. I plan on holding for a decade.

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures ‚Äútransitory‚Äù.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve‚Äôs April meeting minutes, ‚Äúparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee‚Äôs maximum-employment and price-stability goals‚Äù.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested‚Äù that as the economy continues to quickly, ‚Äúit might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase‚Äù, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it‚Äôs important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed‚Äôs targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, ‚ÄúI do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.‚Äù

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year. 
* Ford Motor Co said on Monday its new electric F-150 Lightning Pro for commercial customers would be available at a starting price of $39,974.

1. Added oversight.
2. The enshrining in the law of the ambitious target of reducing gas emissions by 55 percent by the end of the decade.

The trend (price increase) can be seen intensifying in mid-April and mid-May after the EU announced the submission of the law and the approval of the wording in parliament.

At the same time, the extreme cold wave that hit Europe in early January, and returned in early April, caused increased use of heating solutions that produce significant carbon dioxide emissions.

Let me explain why.

Vanadium is holding a strong necessity due to the increased demand in the Steel Industry, forcing China (the leading vanadium producers) to become a net importer.

As for Vanadium Electrolyte, this 'gold dust' is going to play the most important role for VRFB efficiency. The mineral has proven to last 25+ years in a Redox Flow Battery, whilst performing 4/5 charge cycles a day, this blows the Lithium Battery out the park.

Vanadium Electrolyte can be recycled and replaced with additional Vanadium Electrolyte after the 25+ year lifecycle is up to perform a further 25+ years. Proving to be an effective, environmentally friendly and a competitive replacement to the traditional Lithium Battery Storage.

The Renewable Energy goal is to keep an energy efficient system sustainable. In present times the typical Energy Storage solution has a Lithium battery storing the energy to release when in demand.
Lithium Batteries are not sustainable enough.

The performance of lithium batteries decreases due to its limited charge cycles becoming a 'bottleneck' to the sustainable solution, just like your mobile phone battery worsens after a year of use.
Not to mention the flammable risk factor.

Doesn't sound very sustainable.

This is where the space of VRFB technology for Energy Storage is born. Vanadium is a popular candidate to be used in a Redox Flow Battery. Proving itself, sustainable, effecting and efficient due to its unlimited charge cycles, in comparison to a Lithium Battery.

With how Bushveld Minerals (BMN) positioned themselves with the largest untapped Vanadium Reserves in the world, an Electrolyte Plant due to start construction later this year whilst partnered with the South African Government, alongside VRFB devopment funding, not to mention their 25.5% holding in Enerox. BMN holds a very strong campaign to provide an excellent return Long Term.

A recent PR states that MICT obtained certification to operate its products through T-Mobile, which would advance its sakes efforts to ‚Äútwo significant potential customers:‚Äù [investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2021/MICT-Inc.-Subsidiary-Micronet-Inc.-Secures-Certification-to-Operate-Its-Smart-Camera-Product-on-T-Mobiles-Global-Mobile-Network/default.aspx)

**Merger & Launch of 3 New Business Lines**

In 2019, a merger fell through that would have seen MICT taken over by Global Fintech Holdings (GFH; a company formed by ParagonEx, a technology provider to the retail trading industry, and Chinese firm Brookfield Interactive Hong Kong (Brookfield) ([financemagnates.com/forex/t...](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/technology/new-investors-join-paragonex-mict-and-brookfield-merger/) ).

In 2020, MICT transformed into a fintech ticker through something of a reverse merger and acquired GFH Intermediate ([nasdaq.com/press-release/mi...](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mict-enters-fintech-market-with-acquisition-of-global-fintech-holdings-for-%2426)).

The telematics business remained, but the fintech business was planned with three initial verticals (all focusing on Hong Kong and China): \* Insurance \* Equities trading \* Oil & Gas \*

The merger transaction closed July 1, 2020 ([prnewswire.com/news-release...](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mict-closes-acquisition-of-global-fintech-holdings-with-15-million-in-committed-funding-301086969.html)). With the transformation, CEO David Lucatz left the company, replaced by Darren Mercer. In 1/7/21 MICT moved its core operations to HK.([investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2021/MICT-Moves-Core-Operations-to-Hong-Kong-to-Better-Reflect-Customer-and-Revenue-Base/default.aspx))

**First Spike in Stock Price**

With a still-small float and investors excited about the merger and upcoming vertical launches, the stock took off from promising-but-not-huge telematics news. [investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2020/Micronet-Receives-First-Major-Order-for-SmartCam-Following-Successful-Pilot-Trial-with-Leading-Global-Telematics-Provider/default.aspx).

On 9/18/2020, the price spiked from $4 to $8.45, but quickly returned to the \~$4.50 area. Understandably, this drew a lot of interest from retail investors...and shorts.

**Major Acquisition to Get Trading License**

On 10/1/2020, MICT announced its acquisition of Huapei Global Securities.

At closing, MICT took 9% of the Hong Kong-based securities and investments firm, with an option to acquire the remaining 91% of the firm upon approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the principal regulator of Hong Kong‚Äôs securities and futures markets. [investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2020/MICT-enters-into-agreement-to-acquire-Hong-Kong-securities-and-investments-firm-serving-China-Hong-Kong-and-United-States/default.aspx)

On February 25, 2021, MICT received HK SFC approval.

The following day, MICT completed the purchase of Huapei‚Äôs remaining 91%. [investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2021/MICT-Acquires-Key-License-for-Soon-to-Launch-Stock-Trading-and-Wealth-Management-Platform-and-Mobile-App-in-China-and-Hong-Kong/default.aspx) This gave MICT the license to trade in HK and China that other competitors were unable to obtain and cleared the way for the trading app beta testing and expected Q2 launch.

**Funds Raised by Direct Offerings/Significant Institutional Buy-In**

Just before the launch of the Insurance vertical, MICT raised [$25M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/25M) through an offering in November 2020 ([investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2020/MICT-Announces-Closing-of-25-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering/default.aspx)).

This added to the $18.6M cash on hand, and no debt.

MICT is most criticized by short-term retail investors for back-to-back registered direct offerings in February ([$60M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/60M)) [investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2021/MICT-Announces-Closing-of-60-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering-Priced-At-The-Market-Under-Nasdaq-Rules/default.aspx) and March ([$54M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/54M)) [investors.mict-inc.com/news...](https://investors.mict-inc.com/news/news-details/2021/MICT-Announces-Closing-of-54-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering-Priced-At-The-Market-Under-Nasdaq-Rules/default.aspx)

This drew short interest and the stock price dropped from the 2.90s to the 1.70s immediately. However, institutional investors‚Äô quarterly filings for Q1 have recently revealed significant institutional holdings as of 3/31/21 (I.e., post offerings) by the likes of Vanguard (3.5M shares), BlackStone, MorganStanley, Schwab, T. Rowe Price, Millennium, Geode, Citadel, Capstone, Goldman Sachs, and Rothschild.

**Commodities Trading (Oil & Gas)**

2/10/21, MICT announced its wholly-owned subsidiary has entered into a partnership with Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Trading Center (the ‚ÄúExchange‚Äù), established in 2015 by Xinhua News Agency, PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC, among others, to provide pioneering financial services in support of the platform‚Äôs corporate and government customers who are estimated to make up approximately 20 percent of China‚Äôs oil and gas trade.

MICT‚Äôs subsidiary will earn commissions and transaction fees related to trade clearing, as well as much larger margin financing fees.

**Key Leadership Additions**

In October, MICT named Richard Abrahams, former Managing Director & Head of Equities at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Company Limited HK (international subsidiary of Everbright Securities & Everbright Group), as the CEO of its stock trading and wealth management business.

In November upon the launch of its insurance business, MICT signed an agreement with a management team of >25 high-performing professionals who come from China's largest insurance companies. Members included the CEO, COO and CTO, each w/ 10-20 years track record leading sales, operations, and technology development delivering significant revenues on a very profitable basis at their prior listed insurance companies. \[Linked article is in insurance post\].

‚Ä¢ Previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients showed that the nasally administered Foralumab is well-tolerated with no apparent severe adverse events (SAEs) when dosed for up to 10 consecutive days. Results from these studies showed strong anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment regimen.

New York/London, 25 May 2021 ‚Äì Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (‚ÄúTiziana‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, is pleased to announce that the first patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was dosed with nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Nasal Foralumab 50 mcg (25 mcg/nostril) will be administered in 3-week cycles, with 3 times/week dosing for the first 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest period. This first-ever clinical study in SPMS patients, under an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND, will continue for six months to evaluate routine safety, tolerability, and neurological behaviors. The study will also examine microglial activation, by positron emission tomography (PET), immunological and neurodegenerative markers to assess clinical responses following the treatment regimen.
Previously, Tiziana completed a Phase 1 trial of a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) once a day dosing for 5 consecutive days with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy subjects. The treatment was well-tolerated with no drug-related safety issues reported at doses of up to 250 mcg.

Subsequently, Tiziana reported positive data from the clinical study with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for consecutive 10 days was well-tolerated and there were no apparent severe adverse events. The clinical results demonstrated that the treatment provided significant reduction of lung inflammation together with a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), biomarkers of inflammation, in the blood samples taken from patients ( https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil)

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF REGULATION 2014/596/EU (WHICH FORMS PART OF DOMESTIC UK LAW PURSUANT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018) (""UK MAR""). UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2Œ≥c-/-), it was shown that whilst targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
About Tiziana Life SciencesTiziana Life Sciences plc is a dual listed (NASDAQ: TLSA, UK LSE: TILS) biotechnology company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel molecules to treat human diseases in oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. In addition to Milciclib, the Company will be shortly initiating Phase 2 studies with orally administered Foralumab for Crohn‚Äôs Disease and nasally administered Foralumab for progressive multiple sclerosis. Foralumab is the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (‚ÄúmAb‚Äù) in clinical development in the world. This Phase 2 compound has potential application in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn‚Äôs Disease, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes (‚ÄúT1D‚Äù), inflammatory bowel disease (‚ÄúIBD‚Äù), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where modulation of a T-cell response is desirable. The Company is accelerating development of anti-Interleukin 6 receptor (‚ÄúIL6R‚Äù) mAb, a fully human monoclonal antibody for treatment of IL6-induced inflammation, especially for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'ApEs StIcK tOgEtHeR' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",The Difference In A Trading Structure And A Trading System,,

We believe it would be the key growth catalysis for its Amazon Prime subscription and possibly impact deeply into its advertisement business.

**What is Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. - MGM**

https://preview.redd.it/bbpcu3nvu9171.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70a005edee2d9e4202999eac2a53c89eb66ca8db

If you don't recall what MGM is, the photo above should ring some bells by now. MGM is one of Hollywood's most famous movie producers, with its lion logo at the beginning of every movie that they made. It includes James Bond, Rocky, recently Tomb Raider, and A Star is Born.

&#x200B;

For most people, that means if the e-commerce giant successfully acquires MGM, all those movies will be on Amazon Prime Video on demand. It is good for all those prime users, including myself.

**What Does It Mean To An Investor**

https://preview.redd.it/cjegnzmzu9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5ff2bdd7a6915615c340b50545f72cdaea5bff

Amazon already has Prime Video, why they still need to buy another one you might ask. It buys talented movie makers instead of buying a company. However, this pandemic gave both Amazon and MGM a second thought. For MGM, they are unable to release movies in theaters. In fact, they have already sold some of their movies to streaming services. The pandemic hit the movie industry very badly. On the other hand, Amazon has a hard time making some successful movie in-house. If you don‚Äôt believe it, can you name one movie that it has made? Still, they are one of the biggest streaming service providers.

**Amazon Prime**

https://preview.redd.it/9m1581i3v9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=837149ff148ec751bf413bda5d03fa8fb3149a74

In 2021, there are around 150 million Amazon Prime users in the US, and most of the people join the membership because it offers free one-day shipping locally. This is followed by the second is for the Amazon Prime Video. It's total revenue for the quarter ending 31 March 2021 was almost $110 billion, over 40% increased year over year. If all 150 million Prime members stayed for one year, it contributed over 17 billion. That would be 15% of the company's total revenue. If more than half of the people join Prime because of its streaming service, we believe the acquisition of MGM would boost the Prime subscription number to a new high.

The $9 billion seems too much for acquiring a company studio. However, if you compared the $11 billion spent on video and music content in 2019; the cost of the first season Lord of the Rings series ($465 million), the acquisition now would be considered as a very good deal for Amazon.

**The Advertisement Network**

Compared with Facebook or Google, the Amazon advertisement network is still very small. However, the potential is hard to ignore. Amazon's advertisement business is generating nearly $7 billion in just a quarter and it keeps growing, it is nearly 80% growth from last year. MGM not only put movies into the theater, but it also has a global-based TV network. The acquisition of MGM would give amazon the tool to test out their advertising serving or targeting capabilities and reach more potential Amazon Prime users worldwide.

**Amazon Web Services - AWS**

For most people, Amazon is just an e-commerce company. However, every investor should know, it is much more than that. Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS, is the biggest cloud service provider worldwide. In fact, this website is being hosted on AWS. AWS delivered over $13 billion in revenue, contributing over 12% of the total revenue. Amazon Prime Video is steaming from AWS which means it can also help Amazon to lower the taxable income by deducting the cost of using AWS services. However, we believe the cloud services growth rate would be slower, yet AWS would remain the dominant company of cloud computing services.

**Overweight**

Amazon is gaining more share in e-commerce due to the pandemic. The cloud services would be the new cash cow, money-making machine, and the Prime Video is believed to drive the Prime subscription number to a new high.",My thought about Amazon MGM acquisition,,
209,2021-05-25 14:27:10,t3_nkr0vt,nkr0vt,StockMarket,"I was wondering if there was a way to use SHAP values when looking at macroeconomic indicators. My first assumption was to see which breakeven rates best predicts inflation via SHAP values and see if there are times when it changes (times when short term breakeven rates dictate inflation vs times when long term breakeven rates dictate inflation). But the problem is that breakeven rates usually referencing a future tenor and I can only analyze ex-post which kind of works against the idea of forecasting (for example the current 1yr breakeven rate references inflation 1yr from now so I would have to a wait for 1 year's worth of inflation data to come out to test the results). 

So my next question was to try to match the returns, they may have similar volatility / variance during times and now I can analyze indicators such as breakeven rates and forward inflation expectation rates. But then I was thinking again and indicators like CPI or PCE aren't quoted as frequently as breakeven rates or forward inflation expectation rates so I don't think the returns will match up.

I was wondering if there are any other macroeconomic indicators or indexes that I could look at where I analyze them via SHAP values. I was thinking about looking at treasury rates and then analyzing the SHAP values with the same features. Any feedback or ideas would be much appreciated.",Using SHAP values within macroeconomic indicators,,

Huge debt isn't always a bad thing, especially in a near zero interest rate economy, and no debt isn't always a good thing. EPS and revenue may be skewed by the one off sale of a property, or some substantial tax write off. There's no single ratio or metric I can look at to say, if this, then buy; it's going to vary wildly from sector to sector and even company to company.

In all, I'm generally not concerned by liabilities, especially if they've shown an ability to pay them down, or have the cash on hand to start doing so. You can always reduce liabilities, but assets that equal or exceed market cap in general tend to point towards buy for me.

Wondering why the fuck after Covid went so down compared to the rest of our Ameriape and Eurotard Airlines? Answer's simple, motherfuckers went bankrupt.

It results that they ended up being tossed away from the NASDAQ resulting in an impotent untradeable position, However a hero diamond handed named Roberto Alvo bought back the company in April 2020.

Why the fuck did it take so long for it to go back and why is it skyrocketing now? Answer's simple:

Covid did hit very strongly in SouthAmerica and at first they lacked vaccines and had plenty of restrictions for traveling, now they are getting a bunch of fucking vaccines, travel restrictions are being removed and tickets are being sold out! Yes retards that's correct, tickets are being sold out!

It is just a matter of time for this stock to go incredibly damn up, by the end of the year we might see a 500% return, but that's just for the basic trader, WE APES ARE DIFFERENT.

IT DOES NOT MATTER IF WE BUY IT OR NOT, EITHER WAY IS GOING ALL THE FUCKING WAY UP,

282,2021-05-25 19:43:41,t3_nky9ga,nky9ga,StockMarket,"ROCK HILL, S.C., May 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --¬†3D Systems¬†(NYSE:DDD) today announced the addition of four new high-performance, production-capable resins to its Figure 4¬Æ¬†portfolio designed specifically for both batch-run, end-use part manufacturing, and prototyping applications. The company has added¬†Figure 4 High Temp 150C FR Black,¬†Figure 4 Tough 65C Black,¬†Figure 4 Tough 60C White, and¬†Figure 4 Rigid Gray¬†that, unlike typical photopolymer resins, feature long-term mechanical performance and stability in indoor and outdoor environments and are suitable for highly complex applications in industries such as consumer electronics, automotive and motorsports, healthcare, industrial goods, and aerospace and defense. These materials are the latest additions to the company‚Äôs existing portfolio of Figure 4 high-speed, production-capable 3D printing materials that include rigid, tough, durable, elastomeric, and high heat deflection temperature (HDT). Unlike technologies such as powder binding or fused deposition modeling (FDM), Figure 4 parts feature a similar out-of-printer appearance to injection-molded plastics, with smooth, glossy surfaces and no visible build lines, thus requiring less post-finishing.

Additionally, the company‚Äôs latest release of its renowned¬†3D Sprint¬Æ¬†software enables high-density part stacking and new strut support structures, which facilitates a 40% improvement in productivity. The complete solution ‚Äì including the company‚Äôs Figure 4 materials and technology, software, and applications expertise ‚Äì helps 3D Systems‚Äô customers deliver batch runs of tens or even hundreds-of-thousands of high-performance, end-use plastic parts.

Novel Material for High HDT, Flame Retardant Applications
Figure 4 High Temp 150C FR Black is a rigid, halogen-free, fire retardant resin ideal for production plastic parts for aerospace and defense, automotive and motorsports, and consumer electronics applications. This material is UL94 V0 rated at 2mm or 3mm thickness for electrical components and printed circuit board covers and housings. It is also compliant with U.S. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 25.853 and FAR Part 23.853 at 3mm thickness, and can be used to produce rigid covers, panels, housings, and small in-cabin parts for transport and commuter aircraft. This material is easy to handle and can be used as supplied without melting or printing at elevated temperatures.

Parts produced with Figure 4 High Temp 150C FR Black delivered mechanical performance and environmental stability for eight years of indoor and one and a half years outdoor per ASTM D4329 and ASTM G194 methods. This environmental stability ensures printed parts remain functional and stable for prolonged durations in indoor and outdoor environments.

Tough, ABS-like Materials for High Load-bearing Production Applications
3D Systems is complementing its Figure 4 portfolio with additional materials uniquely designed to deliver a combination of impact strength, elongation, and tensile strength. Additionally, these materials are engineered for long-term indoor and outdoor mechanical performance and environmental stability. All Figure 4 materials are capable of producing parts with excellent surface quality, accuracy, and repeatability without the need for a secondary thermal cure. The result is faster throughput to part-in-hand.

‚Ä¢Figure 4 Tough 65C Black possesses high elongation at yield (6.6%) which delivers better snaps and clips. This makes it ideal for applications such as brackets, covers, snap fits, structural and load-bearing parts, and custom fasteners. This material delivers long-term indoor and outdoor stability ‚Äì for eight years and one and a half years, respectively ‚Äì positioning it for applications such as automotive and consumer goods parts that must remain functional and stable in indoor and outdoor environments. Figure 4 Tough 65C Black is biocompatible-capable per ISO 10993-5 and is UL94 HB rated for flammability.

‚Ä¢Figure 4 Tough 60C White, similar in overall performance to the Tough 65C Black, is engineered to address mechanical-load bearing applications such as small snap-fits, brackets, handles and fasteners in consumer products, wearable devices, and general use parts that require details, and accuracy. This material is biocompatible-capable per ISO 10993-5 and ISO 10993-10 and can be sterilized using common methods while maintaining its mechanical properties, color, cytotoxicity, and dimensional stability. This makes it an ideal material to produce tools, handles, and small plastic parts designed for medical uses.

Figure 4 Rigid Gray for Static Production Applications
Figure 4 Rigid Gray, similar in overall performance to the previously announced PRO BLK 10 material, demonstrates capabilities for both functional prototyping and end-use part production thanks to its balance of thermal and mechanical properties, combined with excellent print quality, long-term indoor and outdoor mechanical performance and environmental stability. This material is ideal for static rigid housing and covers, casings, panels, and trim. The gray color is helpful for visualization of text, texture, and fine details for functional prototyping. The color also makes this material suitable for secondary processes such as painting and metal plating.

This material is already demonstrating value for 3D Systems‚Äô customers. ‚ÄúWe are using the Figure 4 Rigid Gray material to rapidly deliver functional parts for our consumer sporting goods lines, including ski helmet accessories, bicycle lighting covers, and sporting shoe soles and components,‚Äù said Gr√©goire Mercusot, material engineer, Decathlon. ‚ÄúWe are very impressed with the performance of this material and the overall productivity of the Figure 4 solution. Out of the printer, parts display excellent dimensional accuracy and perfect quality, comparable to injection-molded plastics. The attractive grey color of the material is also ideal for highlighting fine surface details and texture-on-part.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur customers lead their industries in innovation, and they are turning to us for support with increasingly complex applications,‚Äù said Dr. Edwin Hortelano, senior vice president, materials engineering & development, 3D Systems. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not only partnering with our customers to help them design the optimal solution to meet their application challenges, but in many cases, we are also developing new materials that deliver the unique mechanical properties required. Our materials scientists created these latest enhancements for our Figure 4 portfolio to help our customers produce parts that not only enhance performance but improve productivity. The combination of materials, 3D printing technology, software, and deep applications expertise allows 3D Systems to deliver industry-leading additive manufacturing solutions that accelerate time-to-market and enable competitive advantage.‚Äù

General availability of these materials is planned for the middle of June 2021. For more information on 3D Systems‚Äô complete plastic materials portfolio, please visit the company‚Äôs website.

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor‚Äôs said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts‚Äô expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation ‚Äî rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago ‚Äî the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be ‚Äúmostly temporary‚Äù and that the Fed was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be ‚Äúoverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.‚Äù 

**Highlights**

* [U.S. new home sales pulled back less than expected in April over March,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-fell-5-140851441.html) even as rising prices, tight inventory began to ripple through the housing market. New home sales fell by 5.9% in April over the previous month, giving back some of March's 7.4% gain, [the Commerce Department said Tuesday](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Consensus economists were looking for a drop of 7%
* The Washington DC‚Äôs Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* American Electric Power (AEP) target raised by Barclays from $95 to $105 at Overweight. Stock currently around $86.50
* Crown (CCK) target raised by BMO Capital Markets from $120 to $125 at Outperform. Stock currently around $111
* John Deere (DE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $360
   * Jefferies Financial from $400 to $450 at Buy
   * BMO Capital Markets from $400 to $425
* Ingersoll Rand (IR) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $57 to $59 at Overweight. Stock currently around $50
* NetEase $NTES target raised by UBS Group from $133 to $139 at Buy. Stock currently around $113.5
* Restoration Hardware (RH) target raised by Wells Fargo from $575 to $700 at Overweight. Stock currently around $615
* Target (TGT) price target raised by Morgan Stanley from $233 to $260 at Overweight
* Walmart (WMT) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $170 at Buy. Stock currently around $142

just to clarify, other than this i am a normal teenager, I have a social life, i have a video game addiction, I am studying for my exams, I am just also interested in investing, and eventually financial freedom.

So i am 16, and am opening my first actual account with fidelity under 18 accounts. my father wants me to do this properly and be aware of the taxes and all that, unlike before (he just bought companies for me with my money) i don't know how much exactly, but my dad is willing to invest a sizable amount ( i suspect in the ball part of 10k).

anyway, we plan to dollar cost average in, buy a few companies and hold long term while learning how to actually judge companies and pick good ones for the long term.

my objectives are two-fold with this;

use my skills from school and from this to actually learn about different companies by doing DD, practice reading financial documents, etc. I plan to also have a section of the portfolio be broad market ETF¬¥s, as That seems like a secure way to go for long-term growth.

hopefully, build up a somewhat sizable portfolio that I can add to during college and can help me with my long term aspirations and financial security (get a head start on compound interest)

but so far here is my plan: for my first 3 picks:

AMD is currently at quite a discount at 77$ a share. It has good revenue and year after year growth. With A P/E ratio of 33, it is growing rapidly in the semiconductor market and has contracts to produce chips with both Sony and Microsoft. A rather stable company with a bright future and a competitive moat over intel, main competitor, as well.

AAPL

A very big household name with a strong balance sheet and solid growth, Apple seems like a relatively safe bet while still ensuring growth. its FAAANG as well, so that's good.

NET

A more speculative long-term play, but a company that again, has a healthy balance sheet. Growing more than 50% YoY. provides fast internet and also deals in internet safety, with an ambitious vision to build ‚Äú a better internet‚Äù.

I want to make sure i have a good blend of stable picks while also investing in companies that still have room to grow.

thoughts? ideas? suggestions?

man, i realize how nerdy and how I sound like such a recluse. I¬¥m honestly not.",16 yr old getting a fidelity account...thoughts on my strat/picks?,,

The stock market's trend is finally in an uptrend!

During market uptrends, most stocks increase in price, significantly increasing your chances of making profits when buying. That does not mean to get reckless and forget about your risk management techniques tho.

This week, 3 distribution days will become less significant for both the $SPY and $QQQ, giving us a bit more breathing room, but don't forget that fact that we can gain distribution days on any day. Too many of those do have the potential to bring the market down again.

&#x200B;

I currently use Google Docs and do the below, but it's a bit laborious/fiddly to set-up. I've also set-up on the newest Excel but ditched it because it's not real time like Google. 

&#x200B;

1) It's cool this includes other countries, such as the UK, That's a plus for me. But it displays it as dollars, and also, UK stocks are quoted in pence, so you need to divide by 100. Also, although it's nice to show as single currencies as total, the actual price should be in the currencies of the stock, it would be weird for me not seeing MSFT at $250 but ¬£200. 

2) Be good to have ¬£ (and probably Euro's), as these feel like major Western currencies. 

3) You need either itemised point in time comparisons or be able to enter the average buy price, so you could properly see the change in performance. 

4) Dividend payments would also be useful to see next to each stock, as well as dividend information more generally, such as ex-divi. This is also why you might need the ability to enter/upload itemised transactions, because I might have increased my holding after ex-divi. That said, even seeing my annualised expected divi at a moment in time would be useful. 

5) It could be useful to show the impact of FX. Again, if you knew the date the stock was bought and the currencies, you could look up the FX on that day, and calculate versus today. Alternatively, you could ask the user to upload that value when entering a transaction. 

6) If this is meant to be a wealth dashboard, there's a few areas missing. Properties, retirement accounts, savings, other bank accounts, etc, could likewise do with their own sections, even if you had to manually add them in, be good to have options. 

7) When you click on day/week/month/all, it would be good if your columns toggled to match, so if you clicked week, as well as the graph updating, so would the $24hr and 24hr% 

8) More dashboard on top. For example, sector splits, dividend by month received/projected, performance by country and/or performance by index, wealth stacked graphs showing breakdown by investment type, +/- by day, perhaps a variance distribution aggregating %s, so 0.00-0.24%, 8 occurrences, 0.25%-0.49%, 7 occurrences, and so on, performance versus selectable benchmarks, etc.",,gzgt4b2,t3_nkzr8v

‚ÄúVolume at the Fed‚Äôs overnight reverse repo window surged to $433 billion on Tuesday, according to New York Fed data. Analysts said that was the third largest uptake ever, the biggest being $474.6 billion on Dec. 31, 2015.

A little over two months ago, around mid-March, there was zero reverse repo activity.‚Äú 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of Reddit posts about this in subs related to the stock which shall not be named, but none in other subs. I am wondering what other people think the real implications are of this? (besides being a reason to HODL)

It seems to me there is either too much cash in the system or not enough t-bills, or both? And the fed will soon be forced to stop buying$120B in bonds every month (ie, QE) and/or raise the overnight repo rate and IOER rate? It seems the Fed is struggling this year to keep these rates above 0 (opposite of spike that happened in Sep 2019)
The market is pretty smart so has it already priced in a quicker start to interest rate increases and/or end of QE? Or could this cause a shock and a severe stock price correction this summer?

535,2021-05-26 03:23:00,t1_gzh0br0,,StockMarket,"Sounds like you have good ideas and plans. Keep researching and keep focusing on the companies. Try to ignore the market volatility if you can. This assumes you are a long term buy and hold investor. If you are looking at trading, or timing the market you will need a very different mindset and skills.

So if was starting a new portfolio I would go with something like this:

    10%      Cash
10% VTI  Vanguard Total Market Index ETF
10% VXUS Vanguard Total International ETF
10% VB   Vanguard Small Cap ETF
10% VTV  Vanguard Value ETF
10% VNQ  Vanguard Real Estate ETF
10% VIG  Vanguard Dividend ETF
30%      15 Stocks (2% each)

The ETFs give a solid lower volatility base and the stock picks provide higher growth with higher risk. The cash position will give you flexibility to take advantage of market changes or new stock picks that opportunistically present themselves.

As for your suggestions, you can't really go wrong with AAPL, but keep in mind that it is almost a value stock now and is unlikely to see high growth. NET is a better growth choice and is a solid company with good future prospects as you noted.

If you are looking for a complete portfolio, including some starting stock picks you could try this for ideas:

Honestly I don't see myself selling anything any time soon, like literally I think I'll hold these forever. That long term. I do however want to build up my portfolio a bit more before putting more money into a few of the ETFs and a few other stocks I have in mind. Current portfolio is:  
$4261.74 invested total  
ETFs:  
22.7% VOO ETF (2.51 shares) [I'm eventually just going to put money more into VOO over SPY]  
10.4% SPY ETF (1.05 shares)  
8.3% VTV ETF (2.53 shares)   
6.3% VUG ETF (1 share) [Growth ETF + Value ETF = good combo to me] 


Stocks:  
16.2% V (3.02 shares) [my best stock so far, i love V. Visa is great]
18% KO (14.02 shares) [stable but has good dividends, plus more people will be going out and about as the pandemic restrictions lift]  
18% AGNC (41.5 shares)  [Very good growth and dividends payout]  

With those I mostly just wanted to experiment with the dividends and see how it goes from there and get at least some dividends worth to put back into investing. 


Future additions I'm thinking about are:  
QQQ ETF  
NDAQ   
CCL (Carnival cruises will open back up to pre-covid levels soon, which I believe will boost the price and have them continue to grow like they were pre covid)  
DIS (Disney has the same reasoning as CCL)  
O Looks promising but I don't know anything about this company. They got hit hard by covid, as did everything else, and look to be making a recovery with growth like everything else.

Royal Helium or $RHC is a Canada based pure play in Helium exploration. While stocks like Avanti Energy and Desert Mountain Energy have gone up wildly, Royal Helium is still comparably cheap, although

* they found a massive helium reservoir,
* will most likely start production in 2021,
* have THE largest land package of all of the helium companies.

The size of the land package of 1,000,000 acres is only second to North American Helium, that‚Äòs a successful, yet unfortunately privately held company.

So I guess people are focussing too much on the wider spread headlines of those smaller companies, but Royal Helium has a much bigger headstart.

Currently valued at CAD 78MM they are looking at a business case (lower case) of at least CAD 165MM revenues with their current reserves discovered and crude helium sales at the well.

Also, they secured a CAD 15MM financing round in a bought deal, meaning money is safe and they can go into further developing wells.

Their Twitter channel is pretty informative and I really like the team!

What‚Äòs your take on this and the other companies? To my knowledge there are

* Royal Helium
* Imperial Helium (IPOed recently)
* Desert Mountain Energy
* Avanti Energy
* American Helium

as relevant players. if you got that sector on the radar, let me know your take!",Royal Helium // North American Helium Industry,,

In layman‚Äôs terms, the implication is that banks are overexposed. They need the treasuries to reduce their exposure.

The fact that more and more banks (participants) seems to be rushing for more and more collateral (treasuries), is a sign that the music that started with QE is about to stop. The banks that won‚Äôt have enough collateral to cover their exposure will go bust.

lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this
month increasing his position by 21%.

https://preview.redd.it/dvvhw9u42g171.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a21e8a11b795d01b2d5af463d3ea70cc404d5e9

Why?

&#x200B;

Peru's political situation is becoming incredibly unstable as election day nears. And Hochschild has most of its operations in Peru.

&#x200B;

The marxist-socialist, Pedro Castillo is one of the two leading candidates. 

&#x200B;

Regarding miners in Peru, he wants to ""review the contracts and stop the looting of his people.""

&#x200B;

[https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-05-01/top-peru-presidential-candidate-vows-to-curb-foreign-firms-looting-mining-wealth](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-05-01/top-peru-presidential-candidate-vows-to-curb-foreign-firms-looting-mining-wealth)

&#x200B;

He hasn't made any policies explicit though it's obvious a large tax increase of some form will be pushed through. 

&#x200B;

That spells trouble for any miners in the country. 

&#x200B;

Even worse is if Castillo decides to go full socialist and nationalize all mining operations. 

&#x200B;

He promised not to do this, but the Peruvian left is becoming increasingly radical in their actions - seen in the murders that occured recently.

&#x200B;

If Castillo breaks his promise, we can just look to Venezuela as a template. 

&#x200B;

On the bright side, this situation may be way overblown. 

&#x200B;

The majority of Peru's Congress is made of political parties on the right, who show no interest of changing the status quo.

&#x200B;

Even if Castillo won, we may just get gridlock. It could also be the uncertainty of the situation is worse than the result itself - much like in the USA. 

&#x200B;

If the situation is overblown, $HOC.L should see a nice bump once the election rolls over. 

&#x200B;

For those with a higher appetite for risk, Aftermath Silver $AAG.V is also in Peru. Roughly 50% of their 200M silver resources is in Peru, which explains why it's also gotten destroyed over the last half-year.

&#x200B;

A strong re-rate is in store for these guys if things stabalize in Peru. Worth taking a look.",Hochschild and Peru,,

New York/London, 26 May 2021 ‚Äì Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (‚ÄúTiziana‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, today provided an update on further analysis of lymphocyte subsets from blood samples from a Phase 1 study with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy volunteers. Results exhibiting statistically significant immunomodulatory effects on CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and other inflammatory biomarkers were observed. This Phase 1 trial, conducted at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, was a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study with nasally administered Foralumab at 10, 50 and 250 mcg per day, consecutively for 5 days in healthy volunteers. The treatment was well-tolerated at all doses and there were no apparent symptoms of severe toxicity. Importantly, the treatment showed significant positive effects at 50 mcg/day dose (compared to other dose and placebo groups) on T-cell subsets and inflammatory biomarkers. These data support other clinical and pre-clinical studies showing that this route of administration is capable of inducing site-targeted immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore these pharmacodynamic data point to a clinical dose range that Tiziana intends to test in further clinical development among MS patients.
Highlights of clinical and immunologic data
‚Ä¢ Nasally administered Foralumab was well tolerated and there were no apparent symptoms of severe toxicity or cytokine release syndrome.
‚Ä¢ Systemic levels of Foralumab were below the lower quantitation limit of 8 ng/mL suggesting that nasally administered Foralumab appears to exert its effects via nasal epithelium utilizing local and lymphatic immune systems directly.
‚Ä¢ Most prominent effects among cytotoxic T-cell subsets were observed in the 50mcg group compared to 10mcg, 250mcg and placebo groups.
‚Ä¢ The observed effects in the 50mcg dose group were the following:
a. Statistically significant reductions from baseline in CD8_Tem cytotoxic T-cell subset through 14 days and CD8_TEMRA, CD8_GranzymeB, CD8_Perforin subsets through 21 days
b. Statistically significant increase from baseline in CD8_naive subset through day 21
c. Statistically significant stimulation in production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 along with suppressed production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-Œ≥, suggested a positive trend for immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effect.
These observed clinical responses on biomarkers, indicative of immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory, are consistent with the positive clinical data observed with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for 10 consecutive days was not only well-tolerated but it also showed significant reduction of lung inflammation along with statistically reduced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), in the blood samples taken from patients (https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil).
 
‚ÄúNasal administration of Foralumab is a unique approach to treat patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive MS , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD). This study demonstrates for the first-time that nasally administered Foralumab, at the identified optimal dose of 50 mcg/day, induces immunomodulatory effects capable of providing clinical benefit to treated subjects. These data along with results from our recently completed trial in COVID-19 patients in Brazil suggest a dose-range of 50 mcg-150mcg could be used for future clinical development of nasally administered Foralumab. This is a major accomplishment providing the scientific rationale to move forward with further clinical development of nasally administered Foralumab in patients with neurodegenerative diseases,‚Äù commented Dr. Howard L. Weiner, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of Tiziana Life Sciences and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.  He added that ‚Äúboth oral and nasal administration routes are physiologic approaches to stimulate the mucosal immune system to induce disease modifying immunomodulation. Our immediate focus is on developing Foralumab for treatment of progressive MS.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe demonstration of the positive immunomodulatory effects providing a recommended dose-range is important to move forward with further studies in the progressive MS population‚Äù, stated Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, the study PI at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital.

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2Œ≥c-/-), it was shown that while targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances Tregs and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
Preclinical studies on nasal and oral administration with Anti-CD3 mAbs
Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that mucosal induction of Tregs by oral or nasal administration of anti-CD3 mAbs is an innovative approach to treat autoimmune and anti-inflammatory diseases (Kuhn and Weiner 2016). Nasally administered anti-CD3 mAbs were shown to ameliorate disease in an animal model of multiple sclerosis by inducing IL-10+LAP+ (latency-associated peptide) T cells, demonstrating nasal anti-CD3 mAbs as a new approach to treat progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and other types of chronic CNS inflammation. Additionally, nasally administered anti-CD3 mAbs suppressed lupus in lupus-prone mice (BWF1) by inducing IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤ dependent mechanisms associated with a suppression of IL-17 and IL-21 pro-inflammatory cytokines.

c. Statistically significant stimulation in production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 along with suppressed production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-Œ≥, suggested a positive trend for immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effect.

These observed clinical responses on biomarkers, indicative of immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory, are consistent with the positive clinical data observed with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for 10 consecutive days was not only well-tolerated but it also showed significant reduction of lung inflammation along with statistically reduced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), in the blood samples taken from patients (https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil).
 
‚ÄúNasal administration of Foralumab is a unique approach to treat patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive MS , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD). This study demonstrates for the first-time that nasally administered Foralumab, at the identified optimal dose of 50 mcg/day, induces immunomodulatory effects capable of providing clinical benefit to treated subjects. These data along with results from our recently completed trial in COVID-19 patients in Brazil suggest a dose-range of 50 mcg-150mcg could be used for future clinical development of nasally administered Foralumab. This is a major accomplishment providing the scientific rationale to move forward with further clinical development of nasally administered Foralumab in patients with neurodegenerative diseases,‚Äù commented Dr. Howard L. Weiner, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of Tiziana Life Sciences and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.  He added that ‚Äúboth oral and nasal administration routes are physiologic approaches to stimulate the mucosal immune system to induce disease modifying immunomodulation. Our immediate focus is on developing Foralumab for treatment of progressive MS.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe demonstration of the positive immunomodulatory effects providing a recommended dose-range is important to move forward with further studies in the progressive MS population‚Äù, stated Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, the study PI at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital.

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2Œ≥c-/-), it was shown that while targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances Tregs and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
Preclinical studies on nasal and oral administration with Anti-CD3 mAbs
Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that mucosal induction of Tregs by oral or nasal administration of anti-CD3 mAbs is an innovative approach to treat autoimmune and anti-inflammatory diseases (Kuhn and Weiner 2016). Nasally administered anti-CD3 mAbs were shown to ameliorate disease in an animal model of multiple sclerosis by inducing IL-10+LAP+ (latency-associated peptide) T cells, demonstrating nasal anti-CD3 mAbs as a new approach to treat progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and other types of chronic CNS inflammation. Additionally, nasally administered anti-CD3 mAbs suppressed lupus in lupus-prone mice (BWF1) by inducing IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤ dependent mechanisms associated with a suppression of IL-17 and IL-21 pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The problems arise when banks package loans into securities, sell them away, which spreads them into the market (they are on other banks‚Äô balance sheets), make profits on those because there is a housing market bubble (for example), and that bubble bursts. This is 2008.

As for what the future holds, I can‚Äôt explain it, because I haven‚Äôt seen it happen. But the pandemic will generate a lot of defaults. What is the investment vehicle that bears this toxicity? I don‚Äôt know. But my money is on the Fed itself being overexposed, which would lead to a monetary crisis, since the toxic asset (which were the MBS in 2008) will be the USD. Since it is the reserve currency, the choice for other economic players (countries) will be to leave the US to rot, or go down with them.

Brigadier Gold Limited, announces that it has entered into an agreement with Dig Media Inc. (dba Investing News Network) pursuant to which INN provides certain advertising services to Brigadier. 

Also, to announce the discovery of bulk tonnage type copper mineralization in trenching and further results from exploration of newly identified gold targets at its Picachos gold-silver-copper project Sinaloa, Mexico. Additional assays from phase-1 diamond drilling are anticipated to be received in June.

Pichachos, located approximately four hours' drive from the city of Mazatlan, covers 3,954 hectares and overlaps one of the largest high-amplitude contiguous anomalies for gold and base metals in the western Sierra Madre with values up to 6841 ppb Au in fine-fraction, active channel stream sediments.

Brigadier has completed mapping and sampling of the historic La Gloria underground gold mine in the central part of its Picachos Project. In 2020, Brigadier intercepted La Gloria in DH-BRG-028 between 140 and 141 metres depth where a value of 6.26 g/t gold across 1 metre was returned.

Nobody can create new coins out of nothing or reverse transactions. So who would spend tens of billions just to not create value? It's better to just follow the rules to generate revenue. That's the reasons Bitcoin became the proven store of value everybody is talking about. So far no other crypto has proven to be able to do that. Besides that...

üñº$PicassoNFT - the first marketplace and escrow that allows you to create and trade NFT tokens with both fungible and non-fungible artworks.

Our business model was born in response to a real market need. There is currently no bridge between the world of virtual Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) and real-world artworks. We set out to create a platform that would become the missing piece of the entire NFT ecosystem and accelerate further expansion of this great trend.üìà

NFT Ownershipüîí

$PicassoNFT brings you the possibility to own your favourite NFT artworks with a physical art.

Example: assuming that you are the owner of a NFT purchased on platform, with this you have full rights to it. You will also be receiving a real physical artworks together with it. Our QR codes will confirm the authenticity of both your NFT and physical artwork.

Gold and silver have always managed to pass the test of time no matter the obstacle, this financial cycle / downturn is no different. We recently pushed past 1900 on Gold and holding, and had a tiny pullback after silver hit 28. If you want to protect your wealth or grow it while most things go red, consider either buying physical or a junior mining company like St. James Gold.

If you want more than just my opinion, join their telegram.

St. James's Quinn Project in Newfoundland received their permits to drill and work about a week ago. Its located right beside another project that has discoveries over 3M Oz of gold, pretty good comparison! The company that owns the project beside theirs, has a market cap of over $500 million. St. James runs at a low $74M, SUPER undervalued.

This news is great for their Quinn project, but that's only one of three they own. They also own the Florin Gold Project in the Yukon, and the Grub Line Property in Newfoundland. Most of these properties are 100% owned. Great deals.

  
The 52-week range goes from 0.06 to 6.5, that's over 100x increase, incredible!! Just in the last 6 months the SP has gone from 0.15 to a current 4.7, that's more than 30x.

There is no long-term debt on the books so far but the company is still pre-revenue.

There was a recent dip that seems like a great place to get in before it starts soaring again. Future drilling permits and production will be in the near future so I wouldn't want to miss on this if I were you.

Stay safe, this is not financial advice!!",St. James Gold Corp. Recently Got Their Permit to Drill. Super Undervalued Junior Mining Company Great SP Returns YTD,,

If they are keeping lumber from Canada from coming in to keep supply down to offload foreclosures then they can‚Äôt also keep real inflation down at the same which is caused by things like commodities such as lumber rising, increasing real inflation, and eventually forcing the fed‚Äôs hand to eventually raise as well. Trumps tariffs were pre pandemic and in line w his nationalistic bent. Furthermore if this is all to help banks how about much bigger fish like tech? Are you telling me antiquated banks are going to help the US stave off China, or will it be the tech companies which are very allergic to rising inflationary pressures.
