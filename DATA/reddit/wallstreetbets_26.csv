The decay totally takes care of the rest. If you look at a 1 year + chart of UVXY, it's hard to find any 4 month period where if you were get puts in at a peak or even peak-ish moment and then 4 months later there isn't at least a few days where your put would have been well ITM. now, if the VIX settles to neutral as it's asymptotic trend seems to be doing, and/or we head for a consistently down market, this strategy doesn't work. But even in a super choppy up/down market, the decay factor of placing puts on a highly leveraged fund has been working well!

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

605,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/) on 5/8, saying if we dont pop off the 50d SMA, we gonna crash down and find some support at the ~42.5 level. We’ll proceed to consolidate for a few weeks from there and build support. We did exactly that.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5.

Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
648,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

656,,2021-05-23 12:37:26,t3_nj6x5e,,wallstreetbets," Himax Technologies is a semicoductor manufacturer based in Taiwan. They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html)
4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside. 

1. A new product line of Phase Modulation platforms was released last week that could disrupt automotive/EV display technology  . "" Himax’s phase modulation LCoS enables multi-focal holographic displays in automotive AR HUD and will disrupt the common standard of HUD today"" [https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Himax-phase-modulation-LCoS\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Himax-phase-modulation-LCoS_Final.pdf)
2. Their WiseEye technology, another digitial display tech, is coming online for sales in Q4, with Tier 1 costumers already lined up "" WiseEye product line which the Company believes will be a major growth engine for its business for many years.  "" [https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)
3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

**Price Targets**

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.

[SPY, Yearly % Returns](https://imgur.com/mSTSsLh) ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns))

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo.

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

674,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

676,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

677,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
678,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans.

&#x200B;

**History of my Due Diligence:**

&#x200B;

[First Post on 1/31/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/l9692t/kt_kt_corporation_top_korean_telecom_below_book/)

[Second Post on 3/15/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/m5y5yc/six_week_update_on_kt_corporation_stock_up_11/)

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

&#x200B;

**Major (to me) News/Updates Since My Last Post, 3/15/2021:**

3/17/2021 - [KT beefs up cloud business](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=305637) (talks about  ""currently generating 400 billion won in cloud sales, but considering our infrastructure, we aim to achieve 1 trillion won by 2023."")

4/08/2021 - [KT chosen to build national Indonesian Satellite Network](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0004880999/office/277) (just shows the caliber of KT team... and I believe the infrastructure projects help build trust and acceptance within those countries for cloud services or media services- good strategy, imo).

4/09/2021 - [KT to build second ""Genie Music"" in Vietnam](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0003895173/office/011) (Genie music is their music streaming platform [which has 4.4 million subscribers](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/02/129_303991.html). I really like the localized strategy and I believe the investments like this will pay off big in the long run... Vietnam has nearly 100 million people, for your reference.)

4/16/2021 - [Bank Salad equity investment... possible future acquisition](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/04/602_307289.html) (like Mint app, [more background info on Bank Salad here](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/513_277691.html))

4/27/2021 -  [KT creates a ""Korean Silicon Valley"" with top school, Seoul National University](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0004785297/office/009) (goal of establishing the largest startup fostering cluster in Asia and creating a self-sustaining startup ecosystem in which startup growth leads to vitalization of the local economy based on Seoul National University's excellent talent and research capabilities.)

5/18/2021 - [KT Corp opens data center in Seoul, in response to increased demand](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/kt-corp-opens-data-center-in-seoul-south-korea/) (this reiterates the growth targets mentioned in the 3/17/2021 article).

5/21/2021 - [Korean Analysts predicting stock will double by 2022](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105210009) (Analysts seem to be digesting all the news and recent earnings postively... which is good to see. I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

Ongoing .... [A huge amount of patents being filed this year and last](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/ticker/KT?searchticker=KT). I haven't done too much research into their patent portfolio, but a couple new ones popped up with week which led me to the linked website. They seem to be protecting their 5G innovations a bunch...

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars? What is fair value for $KT?",njpdlv,$KT - Wait for 2-4x your money while collecting a 4.4% dividend? My third DD update on Korean tech giant KT Corporation!

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

1129,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

1305,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

Early in a recovery from a correction moderately OTM leaps are best - good gains on the upside and won't slice your fingers off if the dip keeps dipping.  You can be high IQ and watch order flows to figure out when this is, or you can just wait for fin-twit bulls to go silent.",,

I’m saying you’re being far too optimistic because the industry doesn’t need brick and mortar nearly as much anymore. This whole sub has become this way. GME hasn’t been that profitable of a company for quite some time. I was a manager there over a decade ago and they were already shutting down stores. They don’t care if you buy consoles. Sony doesn’t even make money off consoles. GameStop relies heavily on used games. All the toys and T-shirt’s can be bought at hot topic, Barnes and noble, or tons of other places. They hate PC gaming. They don’t want to deal with those products. They only started selling parts because it’s a last resort to stay relevant. GameStop will not be growing. They won’t go out of business but they are not some bullish company that you think they are. Are you guys even focusing on financial reports? Have you even looked at them. I highly doubt it seeing the comparison you made to iPhones lol.",,

How could a big bet on Canadian banks possibly go wrong?  I mean, the only way it could go tits up is if a bunch of the assets they have on their books turned out to be toxic garbage.  But that's impossible.  There would have to be a massive real estate bubble or something to make that happen.

This either sounds genius, or more likely stupid/doesn't work. $900 calls would be better because if you truly think the stock is going to hit 2k-3k, then you'll make more with buying all $900 calls.

It averaged 20 miles per hour over those 40 miles. With its 4 in-wheel motors putting out over 600 hp it averaged the same speed as a modified 4 Runner with a Nissan Leaf motor (something like 135 hp), which went quite a distance further. Real trophy trucks, which have upwards of 800 hp (so yeah they would be faster, but does not explain the speed difference) did that same 40 miles at average speeds between 50-70 miles per hour.

Idk, why you are pumping this stock when the actual results of vehicles anyone can find are all disasters. I think it is beyond delusional for anyone to believe them to get to production this year (if ever).

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

1861,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

2259,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain.",ni8zp2,NVidia is a good buy right now

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Tilray is poised for significant growth*",ni9jiv,Tilray & Europe

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

2922,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

I know that data can be faked and misreported.  But even if that’s the defense for scoffing at the reported numbers for things like FTDs, that still means we’re just going off hopes and non-verifiable numbers.  

4 months ago you could read DD, then go download and compile data, asses it yourself, and probably come to a similar conclusion.  Now, you can’t do that with the DD.  It’s all hoping an assumption about this and that are right, while claiming the reported data is faked.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

3144,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

3299,,2021-05-22 02:43:19,t3_ni8zp2,,wallstreetbets,"In September, NVidia released the RTX 3000 series. They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain.",ni8zp2,NVidia is a good buy right now

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain.",ni8zp2,NVidia is a good buy right now

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Tilray is poised for significant growth*",ni9jiv,Tilray & Europe

and thats going to be a new all time high.

OP probably bought this contract back in February, its already lost almost all of its premium even though there are still almost 2 months left.

next ER is on 8/9 (as per TOS), it may gets a pop for ER run-up... but by that time theta most likely ate most of the premium.

&#x200B;

what if $SPCE moves side ways ? or not high enough ? or moving even lower... 11/25/19 low was $6.90

&#x200B;

sometimes when you are wrong you just have to admit it, but hey if you think you should just let it expires worthless then go ahead, its your money.

They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain.",ni8zp2,NVidia is a good buy right now

Then SPCE nose-dived.   So I've been glad that I sold some SPCE when I did.

And no they didn't have to go through production hell and not have to build from a tent.

Right now monthly production of the mach e is from one plant and at about 6k a month. There has been 20k produced and most are still in the pipeline to the dealers. The cuautitlan plant will peak at 11k a month roughly, when the ramp completes.

The first year projected sales is 50k but when it is fully ramped you're looking at maybe 130k or so per year out of one plant. Not much but it is a good start. I really don't know if it will need to produce any faster, depending on the demand I suppose. 

I remember a time in 2017 in which not a car company was supposed to complete ramp in 2nd half, but only made 2.5k in the entire Q4. But anyways, I digress. Producing cars are difficult business, not all companies are suited for it.

Not a car company is truly the hare in the tortoise and the hare story here. Building fast and making mistakes quickly but got complacent.",,

What is the average utilization of a flight? Some airlines have been filling middle seats while others have kept them free. Pre-covid even, some airlines were much better optimizing their flights than others for higher utilization (e.g. Delta was king of this before the pandemic)

What routes do the airlines cover? Is it mostly cheap Inter-hub destinations with low margins? Or niche vacation spots with higher margins but lower utilization? What percent is international versus domestic, and how does the environment look for international travel? 

Also, a huge part of airlines is where they are in their aircraft cycle — did they just upgrade and already went through the capex spend so they’re well-positioned going forward? Or do they need to buy a new fleet and are going to hemorrhage cash in the next few years?

How are they levered? AAL is over levered relative to peers, hence the discount.

What percentage of their corporate versus consumer? Which demographic is expected to bounce back more quickly post Covid? (Answer: Consumer - this is why Southwest is trading so well while United has lagged.)

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

3905,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

Fresnillo plc (LON: FRES) is the world's largest silver miner (by output) and Mexico's largest gold miner, listed on London Stock Exchange. It has been under sustained share price suppression for months now. Also, on 27th May it will be deleted from MSCI UK Index, therefore asset managers have been dumping the stock for the last few weeks, driving the share price down even further. 

The share price has now fallen nearly 40% from 2020's high of circa 1380p to the 860s. Share price performance has become completely detached from precious metals prices with gold at $1,883 and silver at $27.7 as I type. FY/2021 results were very strong from both cash flow generation, profitability and net debt reduction perspective. There are no bad surprises lurking here, this company is just insanely undervalued now through suppression and manipulation.

Millennium International recently confirmed a short position of over 4m shares (0.55%). Given that Fresnillo is only 25% free float and much of those shares are long-term holds, coupled with low trading volumes which are typically not more than 1-1.5m, this is actually a sizeable position. Given the recent rebound in precious metals prices and end of institutional share dumps, FRES will surely rocket soon leaving this hedge fund scrambling to cover their shorts.

Given the insane debt monetisation programmes being implemented across the globe, the obvious return of damaging price inflation and strength of precious metals market (particularly silver), Fresnillo is one of the best places an ape could be.",njt6pn,WORLD'S LARGEST SILVER MINER HEAVILY SHORTED

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

4352,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

But heres the thing. Inflation doesnt just fall from the skies. The value of a currency declines because the currency amount in float, in assets and overall rises + the velocity of this money escalates in parallel (so that 1 currency unit is spend multiple times more often).

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Tilray is poised for significant growth*",ni9jiv,Tilray & Europe

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

Must try harder.   


Money is a complex societal and legal construct.   


Complex - many variables and moving parts. Difficult to analyse. That’s why economists. 

Societal - includes a great deal of ‘sentiment’. Political aspects. Government and the fiscus 

Legal - without the law, there is no judgement, no guidance and no enforcement.   


Money has ‘value’ because of all three above, and that value is what all three say it is.   


The absolute basic to read is this:

They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain.",ni8zp2,NVidia is a good buy right now

Not gonna even talk about the lying CEO who has been promising this car since 2017 (and I'm sure, this time around it will come out, lol) but with covid still going on around the world and the global chip shortage and EVERY other car manufacturer stopping or halting production of their cars, I'm sure this Start Up which lied about pre orders is the only one on track!

Its sad actually, they people behind it already fucking made millions with their stocks so actually, why should they care if they ever produce a car?
And then they are conning everybody with the ""made in America"" sentiment and getting jobs back to Ohio, while there sure as shit was a reason, why the closed the factory in the first place.

[The 15-Stock Diversification Myth ](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm)

> … **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn’t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> …even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It’s just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

3) this is a long term investment which I plan to hold on for the next 5 years.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

5252,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/ 

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

5420,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

5626,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/) on 5/8, saying if we dont pop off the 50d SMA, we gonna crash down and find some support at the ~42.5 level. We’ll proceed to consolidate for a few weeks from there and build support. We did exactly that.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5. This a 100 stock in a year no question, but the short term pop is the play.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

1. Today's flight was the first from the new Space Port America....the long term operational home
2. Paid flight with [Italian Air Force](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/) is still on the schedule for 2022

Use a logarithmic scale and you will see the market is growing at the rate it has been growing most of the time. Or at least the currency it's getting debased, whatever. So no, the charts don't show a bubble. Now if there is some hidden stuff like CDOs in 2008 happening somewhere else, we are going to find out when it happens, before that, no one knows shit.

edit: the market suffered a prolonged drawdown in 1920s to 1940s, but you see the market recovered fast after 1920s massacre, I put my money down that the recovery stalled in the 40s because someone (I think called hitler) was killing jews for sport in europe and the japanese captured the American colony of Philippines and some shit. So yeah, unless there is a WWIII I don't suspect there will be another 20-30 year long drawdown. In which case, I don't give a shit about stocks.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-



[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(15-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/61y5xgro9q071.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b56255ee6192d2d42892a89ef86ff3745f9b804)

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's.

TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
6103,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

6106,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

6129,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

6131,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

6132,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI.

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well.

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable!

6142,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

But, you know deep down inside she is capable of doing the same thing that your first slut girlfriend did to you. like restricting your friends and tells you not to talk to that person anymore and low and behold you find out your wife has a fucking boyfriend who has been getting all your leftovers and she has been going there after ladies book night and handing him your precious tendies. 


You don't own your share.


Your name isn't on your share... unless (Computershare) Gamestops Transfer Agent has your record on file. 
https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

YOUR BROKER ISN'T YOUR FRIEND!!!!
https://www.schwab.com/email/trade-confirmations

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

its that simple.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart. 

**TA guy come here and tell me which chart should someone use for trading FDs or weeklies? daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, monthly? At what frequency of data points? Which indicators? What is the success rate? Over what time period that success rate is calculated?** 

# Let me tell you my success rate here. I initiated and closed 19 weeklies and FDs last week and I made money from 17, broke even on 1 and lost on 1. That's 89% success rate without any TA.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

6584,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside.

2.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

6607,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

6609,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

6620,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-



[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(15-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/61y5xgro9q071.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b56255ee6192d2d42892a89ef86ff3745f9b804)

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume).

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading.

2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

I read that ByteDance plans to go public in 2021. Does anyone have any additional information? I will be putting money in them when they do go public. 

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams. That endeavor will test not just Zhang’s magic touch with app creation and ByteDance’s AI wizardry, but also investor reception ahead of one of the tech world’s most hotly anticipated IPOs.",nivjv7,ByteDance /Tick Tok

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
6897,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

6900,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside. 

1. A new product line of Phase Modulation platforms was released last week that could disrupt automotive/EV display technology  .

2. Their WiseEye technology, another digitial display tech, is coming online for sales in Q4, with Tier 1 costumers already lined up "" WiseEye product line which the Company believes will be a major growth engine for its business for many years.  "" [https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)
3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

[Blackcock Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/b05q4vts3w071.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5f5c248309093f4ab4d64b8c79fdd8e4d35493)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

6923,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

6925,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

6926,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI.

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

6936,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

Use a logarithmic scale and you will see the market is growing at the rate it has been growing most of the time. Or at least the currency it's getting debased, whatever. So no, the charts don't show a bubble. Now if there is some hidden stuff like CDOs in 2008 happening somewhere else, we are going to find out when it happens, before that, no one knows shit.

edit: the market suffered a prolonged drawdown in 1920s to 1940s, but you see the market recovered fast after 1920s massacre, I put my money down that the recovery stalled in the 40s because someone (I think called hitler) was killing jews for sport in europe and the japanese captured the American colony of Philippines and some shit. So yeah, unless there is a WWIII I don't suspect there will be another 20-30 year long drawdown. In which case, I don't give a shit about stocks.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-



[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(15-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/61y5xgro9q071.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b56255ee6192d2d42892a89ef86ff3745f9b804)

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart. 

**TA guy come here and tell me which chart should someone use for trading FDs or weeklies? daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, monthly? At what frequency of data points? Which indicators? What is the success rate? Over what time period that success rate is calculated?**

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's.

TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

I read that ByteDance plans to go public in 2021. Does anyone have any additional information? I will be putting money in them when they do go public. 

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams. That endeavor will test not just Zhang’s magic touch with app creation and ByteDance’s AI wizardry, but also investor reception ahead of one of the tech world’s most hotly anticipated IPOs.",nivjv7,ByteDance /Tick Tok

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
7142,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

7145,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

7151,,2021-05-23 13:31:19,t3_nj7tco,,wallstreetbets,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

My DD's generally end up in the right direct, but this current one will be my largest bet to date. So here we fucking go my fellow autists. You ready to learn about Dick Kings?  Whats the fucking play? It's DraftKings (DKNG). **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22**

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

[Blackcock Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/b05q4vts3w071.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5f5c248309093f4ab4d64b8c79fdd8e4d35493)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

7168,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

7171,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

Ongoing .... [A huge amount of patents being filed this year and last](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/ticker/KT?searchticker=KT). I haven't done too much research into their patent portfolio, but a couple new ones popped up this week which led me to the linked website. They seem to be protecting their 5G innovations a bunch...

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars? What is fair value for $KT?",njpdlv,$KT - Wait for 2-4x your money while collecting a 4.4% dividend? My third DD update on Korean tech giant KT Corporation!
7181,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

7422,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

But heres the thing. Inflation doesnt just fall from the skies. The value of a currency declines because the currency amount in float, in assets and overall rises + the velocity of this money escalates in parallel (so that 1 currency unit is spend multiple times more often).

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/) on 5/8, saying if we dont pop off the 50d SMA, we gonna crash down and find some support at the ~42.5 level. We’ll proceed to consolidate for a few weeks from there and build support. We did exactly that.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5. This a 100 stock in a year no question, but the short term pop is the play.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

There are at least [8,000 flights](https://www.manufacturing.net/aerospace/news/21118425/virgin-galactic-8000-have-placed-space-flight-reservation) already reserved which equals at least $2B (8,000x 250,000) in locked in future revenue, and the assumption is that if commercial flights start in 2022, new bookings will start much higher up
5. Based on this year's previous stock price the current $21.22 HAS to be oversold by at least 20-25%...I'm thinking it opens at $25/share on Monday

The headwinds

1. The Sir Richie and Spaghetti Air Force flight are [NOT](https://spacenews.com/virgin-galactic-schedules-next-spaceshiptwo-test-flight-for-may-22/) yet scheduled
2. It is unclear if this kind of flight can be done 1-2 times a week
3. BO or Space X starts to eat into this fairly small potential market
4. The number of who people who are willing and able to pay $250k-$500K to 'Touch the Sky' starts to dwindle

7555,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out.

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \* $950 Million = ~~$1.52 Million~~ ($190 K), corresponding to ~~188,350~~ (23,500) shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/](https://www.himax.com.tw/)

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html)
4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside. 

1. A new product line of Phase Modulation platforms was released last week that could disrupt automotive/EV display technology  .

2.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

7624,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

7626,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

7627,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
7628,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

Tldr: I'm jacked past my tits on prpl, at 29 now gonna be high 30s very soon due to catalysts listed above. 

My recs would be 
July 30s and 35s very good chance of printing

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power. 

ITM leaps 20s (spreads are wide so be careful) if you want some relatively safe leverage

safest, will print either now or definitely in the future, prpl is growing and expanding like gang busters and ain't goin anywhere.

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

&#x200B;

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

7637,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

OK, if that's your view?? - but I get the impression - pretty much weekly from international news - and looking at the last few years (since the 50s?) - that a lot of world international policy, meaning (bottom line) gunships, power structurtes, alliances, weapons deals, interference in foreign governments, & deaths, .. comes down to Oil . and not much else. It's kind of a DOMINANT THEME aint it?  
I invest in rare earth metals, I dont feel good or bad about that, I just DD the international situation for interest, and for my own benefit.. and there is DEFINITELY international policy driven by different governments (in competition as governments) about who produces it, mining, processing, refining, distribution, prices, availability, recycling, recovery, control of resources ..

 BUT I don't invest in oil.. I have other stuff that can make me a profit, and oil, as an international driver of world policy causes too much direct trouble.. as we ALL know. It's just a fact, make up your own morality about it, I don't specially care. I aint got no crusade to shout about.  
Oil companies are either diversifying or they are combining to get the maximum profit out of oil exploitation as rapidly as possible before it goes tits up.   
Of course they do both right now (plenty big cash to be made) .. but to me there is a clear trend. Big oil is thinking of Today AND it is thinking Ahead.. it already has plans ten years from now and more.  It already makes investments.  
    
Personally I don't need to be involved with that commodity -  it makes a mess of international policy and peoples lives, it has IN GENERAL too much power, too much money, a crap view of human life, shits on democracy,  and in a while it will be obsolete..   so wtf.. I like my current investment to have future value too.. I dont run on the <<I make the profit so FUCK you>>  principle. Maybe that's why I'm such a crap trader ?  
(deeply sorry if I insulted any really nice oil companies there, I know you are doing your best : profit and happiness, right?)

**HEY!** \- By the way - rare earth metals are **NOT** only about batteries.. we can't run a civilization AT ALL without them. End of story  
Do your DD on rare earths supply chain and what they are for (jeez, what the fuck are they NOT used for?) .   
E.G. I would have thought EVERYBODY by now would know why the car industry is short of chips .. just to state one obvious instance.. like, no rare earths =  no telephones, no electronics, no computers, no TV .. hmm? .. and already smart folk (and smart governments) are extending the definition of rare earths from the scientific group, out  to include aluminum and copper.. 

But still.. when was the last time a US president had a high level meeting on international alliances and arms deals to guarantee lithium supplies?

Gamma Index: Increased to 0.09 (future volatility is low.)		

Vol Trigger: Increased to 415		

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged (415) (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)		

Gamma Notional: Decreased to -367 (large negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying.) (73% increases from 5/13 gamma notional)	

Put Wall Support: Unchanged (410)	 	

Call Wall Strike: Unchanged (410)		

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.89	(when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)	

Net Delta: Decreased to 185,208 (options market makers have a net decreasing long hedge.)		

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.08 (call demand)		

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 415, 410, 400\]

From SpotGamma: ""In order for a breakout to manifest, we think that markets must hold that 4150 line and the Call Wall has to roll up to a higher strike from 4200. A break of 4150 likely leads to a quick test of the 4050.""

TA Notes

* Nearby supports - 20, 60, 120 SMMA - 415-414

* Bears need to break 414 for 410-400 (if 415-414 breaks look for high volatility)
* Bulls need to break 418. Make sure support is established at 418. Look out for false breakout. 
* Bullish 🎯 - 419 - 420 - 420.53 - 422.29
* Bearish 🎯 - 412 - 410 - 409.08 - 408.07 - 407.12 - 405

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

But heres the thing. Inflation doesnt just fall from the skies. The value of a currency declines because the currency amount in float, in assets and overall rises + the velocity of this money escalates in parallel (so that 1 currency unit is spend multiple times more often).

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5.

Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

Use a logarithmic scale and you will see the market is growing at the rate it has been growing most of the time. Or at least the currency it's getting debased, whatever. So no, the charts don't show a bubble. Now if there is some hidden stuff like CDOs in 2008 happening somewhere else, we are going to find out when it happens, before that, no one knows shit.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-



[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(15-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/61y5xgro9q071.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b56255ee6192d2d42892a89ef86ff3745f9b804)

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's.

TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
8060,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out.

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

8063,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

Before I start, he's my [track record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan), you can obviously check my post history too.

My DD's generally end up in the right direct, but this current one will be my largest bet to date. So here we fucking go my fellow autists. You ready to learn about Dick Kings?  Whats the fucking play? It's DraftKings (DKNG). **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22**

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

**Fundamentals -** lotta pictures incoming

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

[Blackcock Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/b05q4vts3w071.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5f5c248309093f4ab4d64b8c79fdd8e4d35493)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

8086,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components.

The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

8089,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI.

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth.

8099,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

You don't own your share.


Your name isn't on your share... unless (Computershare) Gamestops Transfer Agent has your record on file.

YOUR BROKER ISN'T YOUR FRIEND!!!!
https://www.schwab.com/email/trade-confirmations

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

its that simple.

I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/) on 5/8, saying if we dont pop off the 50d SMA, we gonna crash down and find some support at the ~42.5 level. We’ll proceed to consolidate for a few weeks from there and build support. We did exactly that.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5. This a 100 stock in a year no question, but the short term pop is the play.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

Use a logarithmic scale and you will see the market is growing at the rate it has been growing most of the time. Or at least the currency it's getting debased, whatever. So no, the charts don't show a bubble. Now if there is some hidden stuff like CDOs in 2008 happening somewhere else, we are going to find out when it happens, before that, no one knows shit.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-



[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(15-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/61y5xgro9q071.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b56255ee6192d2d42892a89ef86ff3745f9b804)

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume).

However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's.

TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

I read that ByteDance plans to go public in 2021. Does anyone have any additional information? I will be putting money in them when they do go public. 

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams. That endeavor will test not just Zhang’s magic touch with app creation and ByteDance’s AI wizardry, but also investor reception ahead of one of the tech world’s most hotly anticipated IPOs.",nivjv7,ByteDance /Tick Tok

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
8414,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

8417,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"
8423,,2021-05-23 13:31:19,t3_nj7tco,,wallstreetbets,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

Before I start, he's my [track record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan), you can obviously check my post history too.

My DD's generally end up in the right direct, but this current one will be my largest bet to date. So here we fucking go my fellow autists. You ready to learn about Dick Kings?  Whats the fucking play? It's DraftKings (DKNG). **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22**

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

[Blackcock Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/b05q4vts3w071.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5f5c248309093f4ab4d64b8c79fdd8e4d35493)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

8440,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

8443,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

She is comforting and reassures you and hell she even gets your lunch ready sometimes. You get into a long term relationship with her and she eventually becomes your wife. But, you know deep down inside she is capable of doing the same thing that your first slut girlfriend did to you. like restricting your friends and tells you not to talk to that person anymore and low and behold you find out your wife has a fucking boyfriend who has been getting all your leftovers and she has been going there after ladies book night and handing him your precious tendies. 


You don't own your share.


Your name isn't on your share... unless (Computershare) Gamestops Transfer Agent has your record on file.

YOUR BROKER ISN'T YOUR FRIEND!!!!
https://www.schwab.com/email/trade-confirmations

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

its that simple.

1. They retain value during inflation so the demand is high. Inflation continues to rise and many fear a sudden spike.

3. The price of building materials sky rocketed which hurt the supply of new homes being built. Even once material prices fall or even crash, there will be a healthy buffer before housing prices follow because it takes time to build.",,

The only ones reporting this are a couple Canadian news sources and nobody else, which is a bit odd. Articles = headline and they were from yesterday.

> Jason Brochu, U.S. Lumber Coalition co-chair, applauded the Commerce Department's commitment to enforce trade laws against ""subsidized and unfairly traded"" Canadian lumber imports.

The US lost their case with the WTO last year in August lol.

>if finalized, will raise producer costs and cut into their profits but is unlikely to affect prices to consumers of wood products, analysts say.
“Prices are supply-and-demand driven,"" he said. ""(Tariffs) drive the cost up for producers but it's not going to affect prices.""

Didn’t we already try that experiment in 2018? 

Interesting enough, about 5 days ago. Biden admin said they would review commodities goods from lumber to chips. ([Reuter Link](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-tariff-review-considers-commodity-shortages-inflation-official-2021-05-14/)) Seems like protectionism will solve the lumber shortage.

Obviously, the biggest impact will be US home builder stocks, US lumber stocks, and Canadian lumber stocks. You can look them up on your own and tariffs won’t take place until Q3.

9034,,2021-05-22 18:52:44,t3_nipcvk,,wallstreetbets,"We all have some basic idea of inflation—the rise in the price of goods over time. Inflation is a very, very old concept. It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

*Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results.” -Albert Einstein*

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/](https://www.himax.com.tw/)

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html)
4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside.

2.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

9079,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

9081,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
9083,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

People have always called GME the ""new gold"", and I think it's only fair to view it in the same light. The findings are scary. As you can see above, the ratio follows very close to that of inflation. It then slows late 2019. This can probably be blamed on the Fed saying they were wrong, according to the Guardian. From here, it only gets worse. Covid dropped numbers significantly (No surprise), but the ratio is yet to recover.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

9092,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

Net Delta: Decreased to 185,208 (options market makers have a net decreasing long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.08 (call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 415, 410, 400\]

From SpotGamma: ""In order for a breakout to manifest, we think that markets must hold that 4150 line and the Call Wall has to roll up to a higher strike from 4200. A break of 4150 likely leads to a quick test of the 4050.""

It feels like a bubble, but all of these things are happening because the US dollar is starting to break under pressure from inflation (finally).

Their energy products, solar panels and utilities are actually sold at a loss. They sell them at a loss because it makes their main product, the car, a more attractive purchase.

They don't actually fully manufacture solar panels by the way, they simply assemble them. They ""make solar panels"" the same way gamers ""make a computer"". They're more of a solar panel reseller than manufacturer.

As for batteries, they're still very reliant on upstream suppliers. And they're not the only people in the world working on battery tech. It looks like they have an edge due to the range on their cars compared with competitors, but that's actually an issue of price-to-utility ratio, competitors aren't selling longer-range cars because consumers don't seem to care much about range past the 200km mark.

tl;dr: There is no ""Tesla energy business"", they're just reselling energy products at a loss to boost car sales and generate carbon credits.",,

The problem you are stumbling on is called a liquidity trap. Banks will not lend out money to the poors if there is not a good use for it. If there is a sound use for the money the bank can ensure they get repaid.

Ask yourself: why are there no good uses for money in our economy??? Maybe something to do with the fact that building a bridge used to cost $50,000,000 but today just the environmental impact study costs $200,000,000 and 5 years to complete. 

Regulations and government intervention have strangled our economy to death since 2008 and therefore millennials have been doing very bad.

It’s too bad these same chumps want to elect Bernie sanders and make the problem 10x worse.  

If you want to fix the problem, scale back government by ~80% and watch money get spent like crazy.",,
