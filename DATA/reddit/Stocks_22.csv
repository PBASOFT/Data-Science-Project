209,gzaskm3,2021-05-24 18:13:36,t1_gzaskm3,t1_gzapohy,stocks,"Then don't trade with risky, speculative tickers. IRA is meant to be long long term wealth growth and putting in alot on high growth stocks can backfire. Going more towards value stocks or index funds are generally safer for long term, but you want a well-rounded, highly diverse portfolio for retirement. 

Case in point, I have my serious money in managed accounts with risk tolerances adjusted based on my age, cash flow, and potential incomr/earnings of my career. I'm relatively young so I'm still in a ""moderately aggressive"" portfolio with my wealth management firm. That will slowly change to less and less aggressive as I age.

So, imo....unless you do this for a living, then pay the stupid management fee and let the algorithms at the large firms handle your market plays for your long long term accounts. You can just set it in some ETFs and forget it, but even then you can miss the shifting of the sands and be ill positioned for sector plays (which my account will pick up and make plays towards). I pay a management fee, which simply means I get access to their algorithms, an advisor on-call, and they handle all the ""manual work"" of placing trades and rebalancing funds/positions.

That's my suggestion. Unless you are confident you can beat a top-5 bank's algorithm, then go at it yourself. If you want to not have to constantly think about your retirement account(s) positions and if you're doing it right...then just have your wealth management firm manage your serious accounts.

I also have a ""general wealth"" account which is a brokerage account like most, but it's also managed and is much more aggressive than anything in my 401k or ROTH. That is also my serious money, but it's much more in short-term and I could liquidate it at any point (without touching any retirement account) and pay off all debts (mortgage and new car atm). So...it's pretty clear that I fall more in line with the typically ""conservative"" notion that serious money should be managed by a professional (because I have a day job, and 2 kids, and I don't have time to constantly be up at night strategizing). I only play with what is like 5% of my account values in a brokerage account where I have total control. And so far I have realized gain of about 13% (all short-term capital gains) and about 7% of unrealized gain left in. It's just to play with.

But if you're serious about growing wealth and you have a 30-40 year horizon (I.e. retirement ages), then make a managed account, DCA into it for the next 30 years without fault, lay your annual fees, go through bears and bulls. Go through crashes and booms. And when you hit your 50s, have a real talk with your money manager about really tuning the risk to more conservative and safer positions. Depending on how much contributed every month, you'll have lots of zeros behind commas when it's time to push away from equities and more into bonds.",,

To me it only makes sense to drop interest rates to the negatives so people are forced to spend money or lose it. People aren‚Äôt going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less? Negative interest rates are also something that will boost retail growth as retail businesses will be able to borrow money at a negative rate and pay their employees a higher wage to get their business started/back running.

That said they dont exactly have 100% the same holdings given like cash holdings, then the only diversification is in the cash holdings. Pick one and call it a day. Then id pick a desired portfolio structure for whatever your end goal is. Imagine a 90/10 split. Knowing average returns for SP500 is X and you invest 90% then the remaining 10% could be‚Ä¶ i think there are a few stocks that could smash through 10% and would like to capture that. Great! So 90% market 10% speculative. Now you added some risk both upside and downside.

I have listened to their last few ER calls  and read their  ER reports and I'm very bullish. Here are my takeaways:

Business is conservative with their Guidance as always, hence the selloff after the last ER call.  BUT they are guiding **105% growth** next quarter

*"".. ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Our current expectation is that Q2 revenue will grow around 105% year over year. ""*

*""...In Q2, we expect global MAUs to grow in the mid-teens and US MAUs to be around flat on a year-over-year percentage basis.""*

Total revenue was **up 78% y/y to $485M**, steady growth. MAU was 478M, less than 480M expected but it was **up 30% y/y** . This was another reason of selloff, which I think is way more exaggerated. 

Pinterest is intentionally slowing the ads shown in order to grow the users. There is a price to pay if you monetize the users too early before the network effect is fully realized. This is the sole reason why Pinterest has low ARPU compared to Snapchat. Pinterest has almost double the active users but the market cap is less than half. It's growing faster than Snapchat. They can double from here just by monetizing their current users. 

They have not realized their e-commerce potential yet, it has not even started, I think they have just dipped their toe to see how it goes. It will be huge even if their user growth stalls  or even shrinks from current level. They have partnered with Shopify and it has been successful so far. Also as of today they have partnered with IKEA. 

Users go to the Pinterest with the intention of shopping and they don't mind the ads. It's the only platform where the ads actually complements what you are looking for. From my own experience I like how I get different full bedroom setups ads with an option to buy. 

CEO and founder Ben Silbermann owns around 6% (I think, don't quote me on this) of the shares. I like how founder has heavy skin on the game.  Also I like how the management is executing on the roadmap year after year.

Here is what I'll like to see going forward:  I want to see them go full force on the better social media strategy with inspirations and e-commerce. I like them to partner with more companies like Shopify, IKEA, etc. and also keep on working on the native e-commerce experience. Focus on the growth of e-commerce aspect while slowing down the ads aspect though it's incredibly tough at this moment.

You contact your institution of choice and tell them you want to talk about managed brokerage accounts. If it is something that they'll ""take over"" on an existing account, they'll typically liquidate ALL your positions and convert everything to cash. You will pay taxes on your gains with this conversion. And then they will open entirely new positions with the available cash and it will be up and running.

If you are wanting to open up a brand new account from scratch (like, without any account that already exists with the firm), then you'll typically need to do the manual work to liquidate your positions and transfer the cash into the new account. And then in a day or two, you'll see them take it over and they'll invest all that cash into their ""boiler plate"" tickers based on your risk profile.

Ask them about the 403B. Is that basically a 401k but from a nonprofit (or something like that...?). You'll have to explain your accounts to them and they'll ask you want you want to do. They shouldn't be trying to ""sell"" you anything. They should be straightforward with you. I have Schwab and they've been good so far. I've had other firms manage money before as well.

Let them get you started and once you get comfortable (and have free time) you can manage it yourself if you want. Your money isn't held hostage. Too many people don't know what to do and look at management fees as huge detractors to starting. Well...then they just sit on cash for 5 years and it did nothing for them. Best to just open a managed account and see what they do with it. And call your advisor if you want to learn more. They are there to talk to you about your money, so use them. They don't do much of the actual ""thinking"" anymore since it's all ran by computers, but they know general market trends, history, and strategy.

If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I¬¥ll try to answer everything. 

&#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple¬¥s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let¬¥s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple¬¥s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple¬¥s price is higher right now, I don¬¥t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That¬¥s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple¬¥s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I¬¥ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That¬¥s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don¬¥t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I¬¥ll see you again.",nk5zl6,Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy?

I tend to just ignore people entirely when they start complaining about them - go back and read about your investments before you put your money in them. They shouldn't be treated like an index fund where you just chuck money into them every paycheck - they're meant to play a small role in a balanced portfolio. 5-15% (depending on portfolio theme), rebalanced from time to time in order to gain an outsized return on growth markets OR to hedge for disrupted markets. You can literally read that on their \[website\](https://ark-funds.com/help-center/how-to-use-ark-etfs-in-a-portfolio) for ""how to use these funds in your portfolio."" They'll earn you a few percentage points during exceptional markets, while costing you a percentage point or two during other markets.",,

A couple of things come to mind:
1. You are ahead of most people if you‚Äôve been keeping track of all the dividend reinvestment, splits and any spin offs (which can be non taxable and have a basis allocation between the 2 or be taxable).
2. Anything you inherited should have an acquisition date that matches the decedent‚Äôs date of death and a FMV as of that date (there are some flourishes and alternates to this, but this is the case 99.9% of the time). These should all be considered long term as well, even if they were acquired the day before the date of death. If these equities were acquired on or before 12/31/10, they would be uncovered (which means when you sell them, the broker must report the term and proceeds to you and the IRS but they do not have to supply the cost basis info, original acquisition date,etc). Any equity acquired on or after 01/01/2011 is covered and the broker would have to report all of those data points to you and the IRS.
I mentioned the covered dates because with inherited positions, you can roll the tax lots up but you‚Äôd do it in one group of uncovered and one group of covered.
If it was all stocks (or equities as we call them) you inherited, the above is true. If you have any mutual funds, options or bonds, it‚Äôs the same just a hair different on the dates for the covered status (the IRS rolled out what securities became covered between 2011 and 2016).

588,,2021-05-24 20:28:49,t3_nk7ipu,,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures ‚Äútransitory‚Äù.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve‚Äôs April meeting minutes, ‚Äúparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee‚Äôs maximum-employment and price-stability goals‚Äù.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested‚Äù that as the economy continues to quickly, ‚Äúit might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase‚Äù, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it‚Äôs important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed‚Äôs targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, ‚ÄúI do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.‚Äù

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.

2 Key Things From 3D Systems' Earnings Call That Investors Should Know | NASDAQ

Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD reported first-quarter 2021 results that easily beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock skyrocketed 35% the next day.

In the first quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 7.7% year over year (and 17% excluding the impact of divestitures to $146.1 million. Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment, which was hard hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


Moreover, the company posted a profit on both an adjusted basis and according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted for one-time items, net income landed at $20.9 million, or $0.17 per share, up from a loss per share of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. GAAP net income was $45.2 million, or $0.36 per share, up from a loss of $18.9 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from 3D Systems' Q1 earnings call that investors should know.

1. The company's competitive advantages
From CEO Jeffrey Graves' remarks:

There are three things that inspire my confidence in our future. And I believe they should inspire yours as well. First, we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry. [...] Second, I'm convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry. [...]

Third, as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry, we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers' needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing, but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business success.

As to Graves' first point, 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge, at least among publicly traded companies. It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technology.

For a couple of points of comparison: Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS, another well-established pure-play 3D printing company, doesn't have a metal 3D printing technology. Newly public Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTEC.

His second point about having ""the brightest and most creative application engineers"" is too subjective to address.

I'll also agree with Graves' third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage, at least relative to most other players. That said, there's a caveat here. Under the prior two CEOs, the company prematurely released products that had quality issues. So, while scale does usually provide various advantages, it won't do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality. Hopefully, this issue is largely behind 3D Systems, but investors still need to keep an eye on it.

2. Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitions
From Graves' remarks:

As you can see in our numbers for Q1, we're seeing rising demand for new applications, particularly in our healthcare business. To meet this demand forecast, we're expanding our Denver, Colorado, location by roughly 50%. [...] Through this next phase of investment [...] we'll be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications, continue expanding our product offerings, and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer base.

In Q1, 3D Systems' healthcare revenue surged 39% year over year to $72.5 million. This segment accounted for 49.6% of the company's total revenue of $146.1 million. So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrial.

As Graves said on the prior quarter's call, the company's healthcare business ""brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business."" So, naturally, it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitable.

In addition, 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi, a small Philadelphia-based bioprinting company. Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce three-dimensional, functional tissues. This was a smart move and expands the company's involvement in this space, as it's been collaborating with United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR in this realm since 2017.

Graves said one key intermediate-term application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process. A longer-term goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys for transplant purposes. Regenerative medicine, as it's often called, is in its infancy, but it has humongous growth potential.

If the price of the stock you purchased should happen to fall below your new cost basis, if you buy back in there, your cost basis will go back down.

The way i understand is you can buy and sell whenever if you make a gain, but if you take a loss and then turn around and buy a similar lot of the same stock, it does the wash sale adjustment. It is to keep a person from taking a big loss for tax purposes, then buying it back right away.",,

If bonds weren't as overpriced as they are, the remainder would constitute those plus some cash. But with rate hikes on the horizon, it's like a game of chicken: Will the hot market tank and take rates with it, making bonds not such a bad idea? Or will rates rise before then, making them a bad hedge? Do the rising rates trigger a selloff? Is it better to go mostly cash and assume eating inflation will pay off in due course through new, less dangerous opportunities to invest?

My rationale is that the markets--stocks, bonds, etc.--are too high temperature to play aggressively unless you know how to safely navigate the waters. The markets are also more leveraged than they have ever been, which means the downside exposure is relatively extreme if the shit hits the fan. I know for a fact that I don't have the experience to invest aggressively right now, so I'm mostly sitting on cash. People say thst risk doesn't factor into the equation at a young age and so any drastic downturns are ultimately transient, but holding cash that deteriorates slowly over time in hopes of a better opportunity in the next 1-2 years is also transient in the long run and far less painful.

GameStop (GME) closed the most recent trading day at $180.01, moving +1.82% from the previous trading session. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.99%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the video game retailer had gained 16.94% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 3.17% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.26% in that time.

Investors will be hoping for strength from GME as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.56, up 65.22% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.17 billion, up 14.63% from the year-ago period.

GME's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$0.63 per share and revenue of $5.63 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +70.56% and +10.69%, respectively.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for GME. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 13.15% higher. GME is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Retail - Consumer Electronics industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 124, putting it in the top 49% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",nkamm9,Yahoo Finance | GameStop ($GME) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know

A lot of youtubers tend to really sell the idea of day trading or 2day trading stocks, it sounds very appealing to young investors. The idea appealed to me too. The reality is they sell you the idea of trading, but make money off the courses instead. If they were so profitable off trading they would not need to supplement their income through youtube. You have no idea of the advantages hedge funds and quant traders have when it comes to scalping and trading stocks. They have very expensive equipment and pay fir faster order flows and connection speeds. They hire mathematicians and programmers to develop and test trading strategies. When you are day trading you are competing with very expensive computer algorithms.

The stock market is a casino in the short term, but a weighing scale in the long term.

You really need to question your investing when you trade based on hope.  You are HOPING there‚Äôs a huge conspiracy and everyone is hiding numbers, and HOPING a squeeze will happen again, and HOPING short interest is higher than reported.  

How long have you been trading?  I‚Äôve been trading Daily for a living now for 2 years and trades through the whole COVID crash.

You on the other hand FOMO‚Äôd into a stock that had already shot up several 100% - and appear to be convinced you should chase it even More.

My question for you is, does the company have a viable plan for the future yet?  No.  they don‚Äôt.  If they do please link me.

And second question - if Robinhood and citadel changes the rules during the first squeeze, what makes you think they will not do that again, and or why can‚Äôt they just permanently bend the rules here if they are actually screwed in some way due to falsely reported numbers?  

I mean they already control the media and the numbers right?  I guess they‚Äôll just let it go to 10 million, many times more than the entire worlds GDP, 

and we will all live a doomsday market crash (except for you and your digital, fungible shares that you don‚Äôt even own will somehow be able to be cashed out?  Lol)
