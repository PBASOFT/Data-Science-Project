Also would like to note that RH did not ""make $454.06"" on that trade. They just bought you shares at a higher price than you wanted them to.... Also was this today? Because TSLA didn't trade that low today so if you put a limit order in you wouldn't have been filled...",,,gym6hww,t3_nfjiqj

Really, you just have to determine if you are happy with the stock being taken at $13/share.  If so, enjoy the premium you received and wait until expiration.  

While it is possible the shares could be called away early, it is pretty unlikely, so you have plenty of time to decide if you want to roll, buy back, or let expire.",,,gykenwz,t3_nf9u1t

62,2021-05-18 23:14:28,,RobinHood,I bought 100 shares @ 9.88 and immediately sold a 10.00 call. Obviously the underlying flew past my strike price but you can roll it up little by little while still getting paid if you add enough time to the contract(probably like 2-4 weeks out) and eventually it should expire worthless and you can keep your shares while collecting premiums.

You can roll out and up if the premium is there, or just roll out at the same strike and collect premium if you think the stock will move sideways or down by expiry.

85,2021-05-19 00:06:43,,RobinHood,"I'll break it down.  The simplified ""Drunk History"" version of what OP is talking about.  Yeah - I'm drunk.  

OP owns 100 shares of AMC.  His cost basis (not necessarily what he paid to buy them, but what they essentially cost him now after fiddling with selling options) is $10.30 a share (he essentially paid $1030 for 100 shares of AMC). 

He sold a contract saying he would sell someone his 100 shares for $13 each if on 5/28 AMC was trading at or above $13 a share.  Looks like he got paid around $79 for this contract. 

If on 5/28 AMC is above $13, he'll sell his 100 shares for $13 each (get paid $1300, he paid essentially $1030 (looks like the contract he sold got him $79), so he'll make $270 profit).  If AMC is at $50 on 5/28 (or really anything above $13), too bad for OP, he's gonna sell them for $13.

If AMC is below 13 on 5/28, he keeps the shares and makes the $79 he got for selling the contract.

OP wants to possibly buy back the contract (which now cost $225 - so he'll be down $146), but he'll have his shares to do what he wants with now that are worth $1500 with AMC at $15 (worth $200 more than at $13, but OP has to pay $146 for that now). As long as that contract is open, he doesn't really own those shares anymore. There's still 10 days until they expire, AMC could still end up below $13, or at $20 for all we know. So...OP doesn't know what to do.  

""Rolling"" is buying back his contract and selling yet another, further away in time contract to offset the cost of buying back the original one (could sell a contract to sell AMC at $15 in a month or so and break even possibly).  But, then he's still on the hook for this contract. This part is really where OP is seeking help.  To roll or not, and how far to roll (what date), as well as what strike ($13, $15, etc) to roll to.

If AMC sat still or dropped since he sold the contract, OP would have made money or have the consolation that at least he made an extra $79 (8% return on investment in a short time is good $). But...by selling the contract, he also limits his upside if AMC goes up, and has to gamble more (or at least reduce his earnings vs. a buy and hold strategy) on what will happen now.  The stock jumped up, so now he's wishing he still had control of his shares, and want's to know the best way to handle this situation.

TLDR: don't sell Covered Calls at a price you wouldn't be happy to sell your shares.  FOMO and shoulda, coulda, woulda aren't good for investment growth.",,,gymw2bz,t1_gylqf7y

90,2021-05-19 03:16:06,,RobinHood,"He bought 100 shares AND then sold the option, pocketed the premium, and put his 100 shares at risk of being called away for $13 per share if the option buyer chooses to exercise that option before the 5/28 expiration date.",,,gynivhg,t1_gym9gg6

92,2021-05-18 16:31:25,,RobinHood,"I have been selling cc’s the entire time and using premium to buy more on the dip and GME a share or two at a time. Goal is 500-1000 AMC and 20-25 GME. The 2-3 times I had them exercised or got scared enough to close the positions it dawned on me that the ones always at risk were the 2 week options. The 1 week options is like printing money. I just keep reselling them🤣. But yes, it does bring a whole another level of stress into play. You end up rooting for the stock but then screaming it at when it moves too quickly upward🙈. That’s more than this 🦍 can take much longer. So afraid it will take off one morning and I’ll end up with 80% of the cash to buy them back! Then I tell myself that even 1/5 options finish ITM and it’s my turn to pay. Similar to dumping all your shares at the latest “peak” only to rebuy them and a few more as it retreats again. One of these days there WON’T be a retreat and the option writers will feel like they eat a laced banana😳. Plus, you always have the feeling that the wrong players hold the option. They are likely to exercise even when slightly OTM. Catch-22 between trying to become relevant with owning enough shares, to being paranoid about giving the Hedgies any help. It seems to me that every time they do exercise someone’s shares, the cost makes it a negative play long run? Every negative play has to be a positive play somewhere else. It truly is a zero sum game other than the minuscule price paid for option contracts. Someone wins 1,000, someone loses 1,000. If a hedge fund loses half a trillion dollars, some 🦍, somewhere, is benefitting.",,,gyl48zo,t1_gykl33o
93,2021-05-19 04:05:32,,RobinHood,"It will decrease as the time gets shorter assuming the price stays the same. But if the price were to go significantly up or down so will the price. Imagine having a $12 strike price on a call that is in the money on a $14 stock, but since the premium was over $2 a share it's still technically out of the money to whoever bought it. However, if the stock goes up another $1.50 the next day or week, now all of the sudden that contract is worth even more and you could sell at a higher premium.",,,gynod36,t1_gylfhoc
94,2021-05-18 15:47:10,,RobinHood,"Idk, if it flops around for a bit those 100 shares could earn you some good premium if the IV stays high.",,,gykxsg2,t1_gykjmwk

192,2021-05-18 00:19:24,,RobinHood,"The limit price was in the page before you placed the order, with the quantity. 

RH picks the price based on the bid ask spread and the appropriate midpoint based on the option pricing. 

The idea is that if buyers are asking for 50¢ and sellers want 60¢ then RH recommends 55¢. Some options trade in 1¢ increments; others in 5¢ etc. RH suggests a premium price based on this. 

You may also have inadvertently entered a lower premium price on the options selection page. 

If you canceled this order and placed a new one, you’ll need to find one that’s based on whatever is the bid ask spread at the time you’re placing the order. 

If the sellers are asking 60¢ and you offer 40¢, you aren’t going to see it filled. But if they are asking 60¢ and you offer 60¢, it’s likely to get immediately filled. If you really want it filled immediately, you can offer a higher premium and you increase your chances. 

Sometimes when I’m selling calls, I’ll set a high enough price for the day and if the underlying goes up it’ll get filled but otherwise it won’t.

208,2021-05-17 12:03:14,,RobinHood,"Here's to CWBR, my darkhorse covid play. Heavily shorted, low float, high insider ownership, super-promising drugs. Volume has slowed to a crawl and paperhands keep throwing their tickets away; weak buy volume on Friday still crushed the shorts. Quarterly chart looks a little weak but the monthly chart looks better. Fingers crossed for some good news, but watch for the good-news short deals! 1k shares @ 1.30

ZOM appears to have similar recovery, but is weaker. If it can secure support at .75 it'll probably keep trucking along back towards a dollar over the next month or two.

ORLA rejected 4.40. Low float and \**extremely\** shorted. Better-than-expected upside but I'm looking to get back in 3.50-3.75. Sold 300 @ 4.05. When the rocket gets launched it's going to be worth holding on to for a while. Consistently makes the Biggest Loser board, but it's a reporting artifact acting like it opens premarket at $5 every day.

GSAT appears to have secured 1.20. Barcoded last week for hedging, and every day it looked like a bunch of buys at market open, so I suspect it's getting ready to make another jump. Put:call ratio looks bullish. GSAT is my favorite Nokia synergy stock as a satellite 5G-anywhere play.

Speaking of NOK, the charts make me think it's overheated right now and ready for a pullback. I'd be lucky to get 4.25. NOK has been on my watchlist as my Most Valuable Stock as an investment. If I had 50 grand I'd YOLO and diamond hand for dividends coming back. I'm also super-bullish on their plans for their phones, and they have the right stuff to render iOS and Android obsolete.

223,2021-05-16 21:59:09,,RobinHood,"Everyone has given great advice imo.  If I had to rebuild an account from like 2-4K I would honestly move in options.  Until I can get up to 25k for day trading.  I know this isn’t what you asked for and please ignore the following if you truly just want to invest and hold, because others have given you advice on how to invest.

If I had to restart again, I’d use VWAP mostly on a 3minute window that showed 10/30/200 day SMA.  Have RSI / MACD or if I was buying /closing a contract that day probably may be STC.  

I would do boring but steady income on Put Bullish Credit Spreads on AMZN or any stock you felt might be flat - move up slightly (Google / Deere etc etc).  I would buy for two weeks out and close out my positions when around 70% by reading candles and the chart I would determine to ride it out a bit more or close out to start another 2 week play.  

With about roughly $2000, you can collect anywhere from $170 - $450 every 4-7 days depending on your risk tolerance.  I would argue you get most out of time decay first few days and can even jump out at 50% gains but everyone is different on how much juice they want to squeeze out of a orange.  

The reason why I would go this route is to simply basically collect anywhere from $180 - $280 a week // $720 - $1120 a month (put contract prices way out of money, safer and easier giving you a buffer from current price) which some weeks are better than others but looking at about $700 per month with only $2000.  That can grow your initial $2000 capital or pay for some bills/debt, drinking money or in about two months just travel more.

225,2021-05-16 21:05:15,,RobinHood,"I have been in a similar situation OP, first wanna say you will prevail if you keep trying; keep trying is the key word here. 

Think of it this way, you've learned your expansive lessons now, so when you really make some money and invest heavier, you wont have to lose as much to learn these lessons.

I had someone put it to me that way before I had lost much, and didnt put much thought into it, and then I had a really bad week litteraly this past week, I had 3 grand to invest, I'm young and saved for a good bit of time to save that up, been trading for a little over a year losing a bit here makin it back here but pretty much breaking even and last week within 2 hours I had lost just over a thousand, that was followed by me scrambling to get it back with way too much emotion behind my investments where I lost another 500 the next day; now someones 3k could be someone else's 10k you know what I'm sayin so although that wouldnt be considered a massive loss to some, to me that was half of what I had saved up by working my ass off over months, it crushed me. I stopped chasing the money, I did a bit of research, took a step back and relaxed, within 3 days I had made around 500 back and am slowly making back my losses in full.

Moral of the story is good job in asking for help even though some people arent too quick to give real information or help with this stuff.

My advice from my short time learning this stuff over just a few months, read some books I will link the link someone else gave me after I asked a very similar question (just gotta find it first), it has wayy more info than you'll need which is why the OP of those links is so amazing, books, news sites, charts, tutorials on technical indicators, you name it. Try to look at webulls charts if you can, dont think you need an account to use it just to trade on there. 

Webull is what it is not great not bad, but the charts and the info they give is perfect imo, all the indicators are free to use at your will and if you click the gear by any specific indicator it tells what it does and how to use it, may not be enough detail for some but for me it wasnt as overwhelming as a massive article with all the big terms and stuff, and was so easy to at least understand how to start using em so that I could learn through using them. 

Would love to see what other people say as well so I'm gonna remind myself in 2 days to check back, hope this helps, I will link the info I mentioned asap! 

Goodluck and godspeed!

RemindMe! 2 days ""Need the same advice""",,,gyd8qqc,t3_ndsj48
226,2021-05-17 04:51:37,,RobinHood,"1.) Stop using stock screeners. Pick a max of 3 high liquidity assets in an industry you know a little something about and watch them/baby trade them for at least a year to learn how they react to news, events, get a gauge of price action, etc.

2.) Bollinger Bands, 26 period HMA, 50 period HMA, 200 period HMA, volume by price profile, a good momentum oscillator, learn how to draw trendlines, learn how to find support/resistance

3.) I don't even know what the fuck this means.

Basically here's the thing. It doesn't sound like you know what you're doing. You should not be approaching this the way you're approaching it. You don't know enough about trading to just trade random stocks you find from screeners when you don't know what setups you're looking for or any of that. You are guaranteed to lose money this way.

233,2021-05-17 05:22:39,,RobinHood,"> Start with businesses you know and love yourself.

This is one of the best pieces of investing advice.

Don't put your money into something you don't know about unless you know what you're doing.

Another best piece of advice:

**You will never buy at the lowest and sell at the highest.**

So it's OK to catch a falling knife or something on the rise AS LONG AS IT'S SOMETHING RELIABLE.

And

BE HAPPY IF YOU SELL AT A PROFIT. Don't look back and kick yourself if you didn't make more. I sold Amazon at $900 thinking that was high... but it made me a solid profit back then and it kept the rest of what I was doing going (self funding and building businesses).

**Example of ""Something Reliable""**: The market might crash, but tech companies will bounce back regardless, some of them might not even feel the crash. There are plenty of mainstay companies that you can buy and hold and be happy with.

Applied materials is one of my favorites. They literally dominate the semiconductor equipment and support game. Semiconductors are needed for all of our technology (anything that uses electronics). They aren't going away anytime soon. So if you buy them now or during a dip, you'll be happy in the long run.

One last bonus one:


**It's not a loss if you don't sell.**

Here's the thing, maybe you have a short term strategy, maybe long. Either way, if your investments take a dip, as long as you chose well, hold onto them. They'll come back sometime. It might take days, months, of even years, so this determines on your strategy (which should account for stuff like this).

My RothIRA account survived two market plummets - 2008 and the beginning of the pandemic last year (2020). Once the market came back we were back to gains.

Same goes for my active investing accounts. If any ""bet"" goes negative, I hold onto it until it comes back.",,,gyeuusl,t1_gyd3sm0

235,2021-05-17 05:31:34,,RobinHood,"Can you dumb this down for me. I've been doing options and i suspect theres potential Profit but i dont understand what an option really does.

So when you buy or sell a contract you do so with 100 shares at the price you set. Before you confirm your trade rh shows you the max loss and max profit. Are these numbers accurate?",,,gyevm31,t1_gydfrfz

237,2021-05-17 12:08:19,,RobinHood,"So here's a very basic understanding of an option. 

So you buy a 100 shares of Apple and it goes up 3 bucks tomorrow. Thats great, you can sell those 100 shares and take the gains as profit. 

The problem for a lot of people is we simply don't have the capital to buy a 100 shares of something like Apple. So what do we do if we want the profit but we don't have the upfront capital? 

Welcome to options. 

Options gives you the ability to buy or sell 100 shares of said stock at a certain price. 

There are two MAIN types of options; calls and puts. 

You buy a call if you think the stock will go up and a put if you think a stock will go down. 

So if you bought an option of Apple expiring at the end of the month, and then Apple rose to or above the price you said, you make the profit. 

So if an Apple share rose just two dollars, you could make 200 because your option has the weight of a hundred shares. 

In turn, you put up the price of the call. So if an option contract costs 50 cents a share (again keeping in mind each option is a 100 stocks), then the cost of that option contract would be around $50. Which is the max you can lose in this scenario. 

I could go on and on but frankly its a very convoluted subject and I'm at work. YouTube has some great videos on this so highly recommend you doing research there before progressing into it.",,,gyfpeye,t1_gyevm31

241,2021-05-17 03:33:45,,RobinHood,"To somewhat explain a bit deeper:

In order to allow their customers to buy/sell fractional shares, the broker (or clearer) has to buy/sell whole shares, and divy up the equivalent loss/gain to their various customers.

Because the number of shares the brokerage actually has for fractionals, and the number of customers with fractionals are both constatly changing, they get out of sync, and the brokerage can be on the hook for the difference if the stock swings wildy.

Because of this, a broker might want to stop offering fractionals for a specific symbol, but they can't force people to sell that, but if they don't allow people to open new fractional positions, and as positions turn over, eventually they will be able to get rid of most of the shares they were holding to back those fractional positions.",,,gyejw7d,t3_ndrwqp

594,2021-05-13 14:34:50,,RobinHood,"In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online.",,,gxzd7yx,t3_nbd3bp

601,2021-05-12 21:29:31,nazyo0,RobinHood, Recently I've been trading cryptos on RobinHood since it's commission free and a little fun. anyway I had an idea to make a considerable amount of money with bitcoin. I've noticed that if your carefully overseeing movements with it I could make $500 to $1000 or even more on a single trade if you just wait it out for 10 to 20 minutes or a couple hours. Has anyone done this before or currently doing this? If so does it work?,has anyone had this idea before with crypto currencies on RobinHood?,8.0,,
602,2021-05-12 21:43:28,,RobinHood,"So, what you're saying is that if the value of something you own goes up, you can then sell it to make more money than you put in? Sounds far fetched but now I gotta know too. Is anyone *actually* making money like this?",,,gxwm9yc,t3_nazyo0

605,2021-05-13 04:06:23,,RobinHood,"To make $500-$1000 on BTC you’ll need like $15,000 to $20,000 in capital, and that’s provided you time the market volatility perfectly. I think it’s safe to say that this idea of yours is generally not advised because it’s hard enough to time the market on less volatile assets, but crypto is a different beast. It’s really easy to look back at the graph of the day and see that, yeah there were moments that if you timed BTC right you could make 10% that day... it’s just so hard to get that right and it’s probably just as much luck as anything.",,,gxxwaxl,t3_nazyo0

608,2021-05-13 12:45:46,,RobinHood,"Simply, it doesnt :) it might work for a coulpe of times if you are lucky, but eventually it will fail and you loose more than you gain. if you want to make money from cryptocurrency you need to hodl and react the market movements (taking profits and buying the dips)",,,gxyzoo9,t3_nazyo0

716,2021-05-13 14:35:41,,RobinHood,"In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online.",,,gxzdc3z,t3_n9u717

773,2021-05-09 13:47:04,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting",164.0,,

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough. 

Thanks",Capital gains tax period with mergers,92.0,,
873,2021-05-07 19:47:48,,RobinHood,"I doubt you need to see an accountant.  Most stock for stock mergers in the US are tax-free (which means the holding period doesn't restart) to shareholders, but there are requirements that must be met for tax-free treatment.  There are three ways to figure out whether the acquisition qualified (assuming you are in the US, and the companies are in the US):

\- Easiest - find the press release for the merger, which should say whether the merger will be tax-free for investors).  If it doesn't say, don't assume it will be taxable, but use one of the other ways.

\- Find the tax disclosure in the merger proxy.  Look up the old company on the SEC's website using EDGAR.  Find the DEFM14A, which is the merger proxy.  Search for ""tax"".  There will be a few pages on tax consequences, but best to find the FAQs (usually called ""Question and Answers"") or the comment in the Summary re taxes

\- Send a message to RH and they should be able to tell you when your holding period started

Note, any cash received would most likely be taxable. 

An example of a merger proxy is here:

874,2021-05-07 19:18:18,,RobinHood,"You should be able to just look at your capital gains/losses to-date.  They (the broker) have to specify for tax purposes whether the capital gain or loss of any transaction is short term or long term.   I'm no longer on Robinhood so I'm not sure if you can just look that up or if you have to request your paperwork with them.  If you see that your shares are not showing as long-term, that's Robinhood's problem, as they are required to give you accurate data for tax purposes.  Bring it up with them if there's a problem.  I know I can look at all of my gains/losses broken into short and long term at any time with my current broker.   A merger or other ticker change does not change your date of purchase or cost basis.  Note:  I have not experienced this first-hand, so of course consult a tax professional if your gains still show as short term (assuming you even sold them and the issue comes up).",,,gxb3aux,t3_n75o8q
875,2021-05-07 19:07:36,,RobinHood,"Assume you're in the US? I think what you're saying is you're trying to avoid SHORT TERM cap gains right?

876,2021-05-07 20:02:35,,RobinHood,"You're good.

No capital gains, until you sell the new stock. I've had this happen to me several times before. 

The catch is if it is a cash to shareholders or partial cash to shareholds in the transaction, you will have to pay capital gains on the cash. If it is less then a year short-term gains rules apply.

This isn't uncommon as the buying company only gives even unsplit shares out and the pricing dictated some people ended up with 5.33 shares. The company might give you 5 shares of the new stock and the value of 0.33 shares in cash. You would then have capitol gains on that cash.

&#x200B;

The safest way to check is post-merge check your brokerage account. There will be a section that is called something along the line of ""Realized Gain/Loss"" and you can see your list of gains and losses taken for the year as they occur. You might need to be on the website version of your brokerage account access.

I can see where I had a cash gain due to these partial shares being paid in cash right now in my account in 2020.

In 2020, I had another stock sold to another company that was an all-cash offer, and I had to take capital gains on the year that buy-out of the company happened. 

It will also show you if you had a holding go completely bankrupt and was completely devalued. You can't control when you take that loss, unless you sell it in advance.

&#x200B;

Another scenario, it can also show you. Slightly more complex. I owned Yahoo a few years ago. They old off assets from their primary company, but they also owned stocks in other companies. The biggest was Alibaba. When Yahoo went out of business the stock turned into a holding company with no long-term intention to be an investment company. Over time they sold off their assets and gave shareholders cash directly. I can't control when they distribute that cash, but I pay capitol gains on that in the year they pay me. Oddly enough, these things can take years sometimes and it can become hard to sell off these companies when they are no longer listed in a stock exchange and they become smaller. I usually try to get out of these companies before they get to that point.",,,gxb90fl,t3_n75o8q

From what i’ve learned it seems that diversification works well for someone looking to grow their money over a long period of time. Because of that I put my money into 8 different etf’s a couple weeks ago. Last week, i dove a little deeper into crypto and found ethereum. Seems like a pretty safe bet long term to either break even or sky like bitcoin, so i added some to my portfolio. Recently I read that it’s basically pointless to have so many etfs because of inevitable overlapping, so i’m down to 5 etf’s and eth. My splits are: VTI-20%, VOO-20%, VTG-20%, ETH-20%, MSOS-10%, VONG-10%. Is this a decent plan?

VONG is tech heavy, so no need for VTG.  I don't like MSOS, expense ratio is too high for me.  I consider it high risk and high expense so I would dump it.  I think ETH is a little high, but that is me.  No more than 10% of a portfolio should be in crypto, but that's my personal opinion.",,,gxkuk4f,t1_gxb61qd

906,2021-05-06 13:25:09,n677o1,RobinHood,"Honestly this post may come off very ignorant and I’m sorry in advance I just want to make sure I’m not digging a hole for myself without even realizing it. 

So I setup a Robinhood account last night and I linked it to my bank and put money into my Robinhood account. I got a free stock and I put some money into dogecoin. So my questions are

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.


Edit- Thanks everyone who replied! I wasn’t expecting so many very helpful and not rude comments. I was expecting to get bashed to all hell",Will I end up owing money?,249.0,,
907,2021-05-06 13:46:37,,RobinHood,"If you are on a (free) cash account, it is impossible that you will owe money, as you will only be able to use what you deposit (buying power), you can only buy what you have the available buying power for and whatever you buy can only go to $0, not negative.

If you are on an (free) instant account, when you start a transfer to Roninhood, they make the $ amount instantly available to you for trading, even though it hasn't been withdrawn from your bank yet. So the only way you can owe money is if you start a transfer but it gets returned insufficient funds from your bank, and they will reverse the transfer.

On both free accounts, interest isn't paid, its earned. I have a 0.3% interest rate (be aware that is zero point three percent, as in less than 1 percent, not 30 percent), and you will accrue interest monthly on any cash in your Robinhood portfolio. 

Only when you start borrowing money from them can you end up owing money, and even then, unless you literally are spending money you KNOW you don't have, it will be difficult to go in the negative.",,,gx5e3iq,t3_n677o1

910,2021-05-06 13:44:05,,RobinHood,Do not use margin that’s it. You can’t owe money other than that.,,,gx5druc,t3_n677o1
911,2021-05-06 13:51:16,,RobinHood,"You’ll have to see if you have margin enabled. To do that, click on the Account button and go to Investing. 

You should see something called Margin Investing - check and ensure that it’s disabled. If you enable Margin Investing, you’re essentially trading on borrowed funds, where you’ll owe 2.5% flat interest rate on anything above $1000. 

You could end up owing money in two ways:

1. If you have margin enabled, where you trade on borrowed money and you don’t profit and end up owing RH money. If this happens, you’ll get a “margin call” to make up for the funds. 
2. If you play with some sophisticated options like credit spreads, which may not go your way. 

Obviously these are not the only ways but if you are simply transferring funds and buying and selling stocks, you’ll likely be fine.

Just steer clear of options as a beginner investor and spend time learning how things work.",,,gx5ep7w,t3_n677o1
912,2021-05-06 13:53:55,,RobinHood,"You would owe money by buying on margin - which is where they lend you money to buy currency or stock  (so don't do that and you won't owe money)

APY interest is most likely the interest they will charge if they lend you money (called a margin account)

So if you just buy stock or currency with the cash in your account you will never owe them money  (you might lose it but you will never get a margin call)",,,gx5f1jp,t3_n677o1

915,2021-05-06 13:45:53,,RobinHood,Unless you purchase on margin you can't end up owing more than you put in. It may be possible with certain options transactions but Im not sure on that if your just starting out it's best to avoid options.,,,gx5e04p,t3_n677o1

917,2021-05-07 10:25:48,,RobinHood,"Let's say you invest 10 dollars of your own money (transferred from your own banking account) into a stock, or crypto with a worth of 100 dollars. Now, worst case scenario, the stock, or crypto plummets to be worth half of what it was when you invested your 10 dollars - now your investment is worth 5 dollars - should you decide to sell it. Vice versa, If your investment doubles in worth (now it worth 200 dollars) the ten dollars you invested would be worth double. To sum it up, if your investing your own money;

A. You will never owe money from your loses - should you decide to sell your investment back at a lower price.

B. If you sell your stock, or crypto at a higher price in which you get a profit, you will owe taxes on what you earned as a ""short term capitol gain"". (Example, your investment from 10 dollars went to 20, and you sold. You will owe taxes on the 10 dollars earned)

C. Golden rule, only invest money you are willing to lose, until you get the hang of it. 

I hope this helps!",,,gx9af7r,t3_n677o1

919,2021-05-07 00:29:05,,RobinHood,"I don’t think this post came off as ignorant but you certainly should do some research about investing basics before you enter the arena. 

SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is extremely worried about robinhood and other brokers ability to lure in people like you who don’t know what they are doing. 

Answer to your question seems to be cleared up already but as long as you aren’t trading with margin you can only lose what you put into it. 

I wouldn’t invest in doge though as again you need to do some research.",,,gx7urkh,t3_n677o1

921,2021-05-06 13:52:15,,RobinHood,"Why in the world would opening an account and getting a free stock make you owe money? Who do you think you owe? Why do you _want_ to owe money?

948,2021-05-06 16:29:04,,RobinHood,"This may get downvoted, but it’s wrong to tell new users that options are bad outright. Options are a useful tool if you have done your research and are within your risk tolerance. There’s an unhealthy amount of “YOLO” options posts on subs like /r/options and WSB, but the demonization of options in general is just as unhealthy. It’s like telling your adolescent child not to take drugs or smoke cigarettes *without explaining why that behavior carries risk.*

That said, if you are new to trading you don’t want to dip your feet into options until you 1) Have studied and understand the different types of options and how they work (lots of resources on YouTube) 2) Have done an adequate amount of research on the particular stock you want to place an option on, and 3) Have a decent amount in your brokerage account (usually around $10,000) because some of them do carry risk of losing money. 

People do options because you can make a substantial amount of money in a short amount of time, but learn to walk before you preform a gymnastic floor routine. If options were easy, absolutely everybody would be trading instead of working.",,,gx60m9a,t1_gx5kh2z

953,2021-05-06 18:40:21,,RobinHood,"You own AMZN at $4,000 on December 15th and sell AMZN for $2000 (-$2000).

You rebuy AMZN at $2000 on December 16th and sell AMZN for $4,000 on December 31st ($2,000).

For the tax season of that year you owe taxes on the $2,000 that you made but cannot claim the $2,000 you lost.

If you day trade and do this many times your losses won't help you on that year of taxes but your gains will still owe taxes. So if you trade a million times and make $1 every other trade and lose $1 every other trade you need to pay taxes on $500,000 you made although in reality you have $0 in your pocket. 

 It's important to note that if you're more than 30 days before Jan 1 this doesn't matter at all. This is to prevent people from selling at a loss and buying the security right back so they can show a loss on their taxes and still own the security.",,,gx6joay,t1_gx65no0

960,2021-05-07 18:58:17,,RobinHood,"Not OP but I would think it's because most forces are trying to drive the prices up, so puts are already at a disadvantage. The company itself is trying to do things that make the price go higher, sometimes the government is taking action to try to keep the overall stock market going up, etc. Overall the odds are already against you to start with.

Plus, just think about the price of the stock itself. It goes down when lots of people sell it, but people have to own the stock before they can sell it, so you can typically keep an eye on stuff like that based on the numbers, rumors, etc. You can get a somewhat decent idea of the risk level of a selloff when buying a call. However, a stock goes up when people are buying, and you have no way of knowing when someone out there is about to make a massive purchase that is going to drive the price up, or when the company is going to make an announcement that will cause a buying frenzy, etc. all of which can come out of nowhere and completely screws you over if you have a put. (yes, there are some negative announcements that can come out to make a price drop suddenly, but those seem to be more rare than good announcements that cause big climbs).",,,gxb0q95,t1_gx7gf17

963,2021-05-06 18:34:30,,RobinHood,"I’m still not quite getting it. So I buy $1000 of stock X. It drops to $900, I sell. Loss $100

I buy it again the next day at $900. It goes to $1000 and I sell. Profit $100.

This means I pay taxes on the $100 gain but don’t offset anything with the $100 loss? Even though I am net $0?

EDIT: in other words, to avoid this issue, if I sell at a loss I MUST not buy the same stock for at least 30 days?

Also what about the reverse situation...
Buy at $900, sell at $1000. 
Next day buy at $1000 sell at $900.

No capital gains tax on the $100 gained but benefit from $100 loss? Or it only works to the IRS’s favor?",,,gx6itsa,t1_gx6db2y

Wash sales apply throughout the year, if you’re in and out of a stock all year long, those wash sales will be disallowed regardless of being before or after 11/30.

You still have to claim the gain but cannot claim the loss.  The order of the transactions doesn't matter. The rule is that if you purchase the same stock within 30 days (before or after) of selling it, you cannot realize the loss. It's factored into the stock's cost basis instead.",,,gx8mqt4,t1_gx6itsa

The way you pay it back is deposit more money or sell so that you place cash back into your account, if you are running on margin the cash will go against your margin. Keep in mind last time I checked the margin rates for robinhood they were about 2% and they gave you $1000 that doesn't accumulate interest.

So you can run $1000 into margin and not be charged any monthly interest. You will pay their $5 for robinhood gold, but it's worth it IMO.",,,gx2xnnh,t3_n5pl3t

You need the amount available to cover the margin you borrowed before you can turn it off.

So, let's say you have $1000 margin invested and $500 in cash. You need to sell $500 so that you have $1000 ""in cash"" before you can turn margin off.

Once it's off, you'll have $0 in cash because you paid back the margin (and $500 left invested).

Of course you *can* just use it as extra funds for a fee, and I’ll admit I do that too, but there’s a view that that can be dangerous but even moreso wasteful because of the interest if you do it long term.

You're saying your new debit card issued by your bank is also:

XXXX XXXX XXXX 1234

Are they exactly the same? i.e. the Xs are all the same? If not, apart from being a coincidence, why would this matter?",,,gx2ekov,t3_n5hg1u
1005,2021-05-05 22:32:17,,RobinHood,"Your bank account number will remain the same unless you close your bank account. Period. 

You debit card, check card, or credit card will have a different number, CV2 code and expiration date if you change the card for any reason (stolen, lost, etc).",,,gx2zx3n,t3_n5hg1u
1006,2021-05-05 21:35:28,,RobinHood,"I think if you don’t know/understand the

1010,2021-05-05 14:57:33,,RobinHood,"I don't think that's what he means. I think he is saying his debit card numbers changed but his checking account number is the same. He is basically saying do they pull the money from the checking account or the debit card. If checking account, it wouldn't matter, but if they pull money from debit it would matter.",,,gx170d8,t1_gx15qfj

1013,2021-05-05 16:57:33,,RobinHood,So robinhood is linked directly to my bank account and does not use my debit card to make transactions?,,,gx1onhp,t1_gx1m2x4

1016,2021-05-05 22:44:01,,RobinHood,"Op isn't talking about his debit card from Robinhood, you fucking twit. If you spent as much time reading what people wrote and less time trolling and spamming a sub for a service you no longer use, we'd both be better off.",,,gx31exg,t1_gx30ulx

1056,2021-05-05 00:15:33,,RobinHood,Short term rates are subject to normal income ranges so if you make less than 10k in total income for the year then you won’t be taxed.  Long term gains aren’t taxed if you make less than 40k per year.,,,gwyulxf,t1_gwyafvn
1057,2021-05-04 03:43:16,n4f7ns,RobinHood,"I apologize if this is a noobish question, but it’s one that I don’t think I’ve seen an answer to.",Is it possible to have a negative account balance when trading options without exercising a contract?,102.0,,
1058,2021-05-04 12:33:52,,RobinHood,As long as you aren’t writing any options (making you the party responsible for taking the loss from an ITM option) then the lowest you should be able to go is 0. Unless you’re using margin of course.,,,gwwdxri,t3_n4f7ns
1059,2021-05-04 11:54:12,,RobinHood,"If you are long options with no leverage, no. If you are short options uncovered, or if you use leverage, yes. There are some cases where your broker will liquidate your position automatically if you suffer sufficient losses on short or leveraged positions, in which case you will need to repay any shortfall in the account. 

One example:
You deposit $5,000 into your account, then purchase $8,000 of weekly in the money calls using robinhood gold. The underlying drops 20% during the holding period and the options expire worthless. Robinhood will either have liquidated the position once the value dropped sufficiently, or an hour before expiration on the expiration date. You now owe robinhood $3,000. 

If you are not intimately familiar with the mechanics of options I would strongly suggest not trading them.",,,gww9xaz,t3_n4f7ns
1060,2021-05-04 10:44:07,,RobinHood,If just buying calls or puts yes you can only lose premium.,,,gww3xmw,t3_n4f7ns
1061,2021-05-04 14:26:33,,RobinHood,"No. Apart from what it means to exercise an option, the first thing to understand is the ability to exercise a contract is available only for option buyers - not option sellers. When you buy an option you 'own' the rights within the contract. This is not true for option sellers. The selling party has sold the rights within the contract and therefore cannot exercise those rights (since they do not own them).

The second thing to understand is that when you buy options, you cannot lose more than the price of the option itself. In other words, your maximum loss is whatever you paid for the option.

Let's put these ideas together. When you use the language ""without exercising a contract"" by definition you are referring to option buyers. As a buyer, then, the lowest value of your option contracts, at expiration for example, is 0. 

Hope that helps

(It may be illuminating to note that exercising options is not typical for most traders)",,,gwws1vq,t3_n4f7ns

1064,2021-05-04 15:54:42,,RobinHood,As long as you're not trading on margin you shouldn't have a negative account. Trading on margin is when you trade with borrowed money. DO NOT DO THAT.  For options the most you can lose is what ever the price of the option was.,,,gwx4y14,t3_n4f7ns

1067,2021-05-14 16:04:53,,RobinHood,"Is it even possible to write an option at level 2? 

I'm having success right now with option, doing 3 trades a week. 

I got lucky with MVIS a while back and am just ""playing"" with that money (pulled out my initial investment). So I'm cool with a worst case scenario being  my account drops to $0, I do not use margins.

I'm always second guess myself when I'm trading, and I remember everything everyone says about trading options and the risk, and wonder if I'm putting myself in more risk then I realize.",,,gy43wf7,t1_gwwdxri

1087,2021-05-03 23:36:49,,RobinHood,"The best way to think of this is to imagine the NYSE 100
Years ago.  You have a room full of buyers and sellers all yelling over each other to either buy at the lowest possible or sell at the highest.  Within this, buyers are trying to outbid each other while sellers are trying to undercut each other, depending on their determination or necessity to sell and buy.  This is where the bid- ask spread comes from.  This is also why the more people participating in the trading of a stock, the closer the bid/ask of that underlying becomes.  Market makers are essentially doing this in real time.  This is also why, although virtually all trading is done on a computer, we still operate by the same market hours we always have.  Without the most people possible participating in the market at the same time, prices can become unclear and you very likely will get ripped off.",,,gwuf7g5,t3_n41ivh

1100,2021-05-03 17:43:30,,RobinHood," Hello, I have never had a job or needed to pay taxes so I have very little idea of how to do it in general. 

I have bought and sold cryptocurrency in around $100-$150 increments, 12 total transactions counting buying and selling on robinhood and made maybe $5 at most in the past few days. I was just bored sitting on my phone buying and selling as it went up and down a few cents, I did not do enough research and just did not think about it from a tax perspective.

I know it seems petty but I am concerned about what that will do to me tax wise as I assume I will now have to file for the first time and for such a small amount earned. 

Do I only pay taxes on the $5 earned, or will I have to pay some for each of the transactions?",,,gwt38dk,t3_n3sdik

1109,2021-05-03 02:40:21,n3m2d0,RobinHood,"I'm in my 50s and just found out I have cancer. I started investing for the first time ever in March. Through trial and error, I'm up $1,700 based on an initial investment of $6k. I'll probably have to pay short-term tax because I did some version of day trading...holding onto stocks for a couple of days then selling. This isn't about taxes, though.   


When should I take out profit so that I recoup my initial investment and am only working with profit? I'm in Eth, BTC, QQQ. I'm also in Apple which I'm going to dump in favor of VTI ETh is soaring, but will likely drop. Should I take out the profit from it -  $760 - then start from scratch with it? I'm tempted to liquidate it all and put it in VTI, let it grow safely, then make another lump sum investment. I'm fine, for now.",When do you take out profits?,52.0,,
1110,2021-05-03 04:35:58,,RobinHood,"I do apologize for the cancer, I hope it can be cured. 

The right time to finish a position and take a profit is subjective. What you shouldn't do is get greedy. Greed has taken many users for their wealth on this sub. Any profit is good profit.

One other note is that you should invest to build wealth not to pay for cancer.
This is purely an example, suppose your treatment costs $1000 and you have all of your capital in one investment. You make a good trade and it increases in value to 900. You wait until it reaches $1000. But then it decreases in value to 700 and never reaches 900 again. 

Of course uee your profits to pay for cancer or whatever esle you need but use logic when trading.",,,gwqx2xx,t3_n3m2d0
1111,2021-05-03 05:28:55,,RobinHood,"Set a goal for yourself based on your plan and purpose for investing. Include a low and high growth goal. 

50% sell when you hit your low goal. 
30% sell when you hit your high goal. 
20% to hold on longer if you feel like it will keep going up, or can be sold at the high goal. 

This is assuming that you are solely looking for profits and are not looking to stay in a stock long term. 

Play around with those numbers based on what you feel. 

Before you buy anything, know why you’re buying it and what your exit strategy is.",,,gwr1ajf,t3_n3m2d0
1112,2021-05-03 05:31:26,,RobinHood,"I take out at 5% to 200% so really it’s up to you. I also own Nvidia and it’s sitting at 300% return, I’m not selling that for at least 10 years for example.

I just ask myself, do I feel this will continue going up based on x, y and z info and my overall opinion on a company or investment. In a bull market it’s hard because most the time just leaving it sitting will gain more. However, in the same time doing swing trades 5-15% makes more over a year so those ones are great.

Also, I wish I learned this before but short term tax rate is the same as ordinary income tax based on what you make. I was all afraid to short term trade, fearing a tax bill but it doesn’t freaking matter. Just pay your dues and move on. I treat it as a job so thus taxed like one. If I got a few million a year in income then I’ll care.",,,gwr1he7,t3_n3m2d0

1114,2021-05-03 17:13:36,,RobinHood,talk to your tax professional but I am also in my 50s and play in my ROTH IRA tax free growth.     what Ive been doing and works for me is I started out  buying  aprox $500 of a stock.  when it was up 20% or more I sell about $500 worth of shares and let the house money ride.  I would invest in another stock or wait till a dip in same stock and buy and sell it over and over again.   Now ive done that for a while  I now take out  investment plus 10 or 20% and then let house money ride.  im up about 40% for year so far,,,gwsyxrb,t3_n3m2d0
1115,2021-05-04 15:23:31,,RobinHood,"Re: Taxes, ideally try to cash out when long-term capital gains tax applies rather than short-term unless it's a tax exempt account. As for an exit strategy, that's really something you need to figure out on your own and then just commit to. It sounds like you want to take out your initial investment, are you comfortable doing that now, or are you hoping to utilize it to make more profit before taking it out? When I make an investment I commit to not needing that money again for a long time. When I take profits I never really take profits, I exit a position at a profit and then roll that into a new investment. Being in your 50s it makes sense that you might be more on the side of things where you're looking to cash out some of the profits and use them. This is really the kind of situation where talking to a CPA is of use and you should consider it, there are even some resources (e.g. local colleges) that can set you up with a free consultation with a CPA.  
This is not financial advice.",,,gwx0cmv,t3_n3m2d0

I've only had a few weeks meaning I'd have to deduct a large chunk - 37 percent - for taxes. But I take your point about being greedy. I feel like cashing out right now, or perhaps selling a limit order to sell when it reaches a certain point - say $800",,,gwvh52y,t1_gwqx2xx

I have been trying to learn about investing, stocks, crypto etc for a few months now by reading and watching YouTube videos. The truth is I'm still pretty overwhelmed and confused by it all. It also doesn't help that I hate numbers lol

Anyway, I decided to ""just do it""  about 3 weeks ago and started with $500 on Robinhood. I have 4 free stocks so far and got 3.11 GE, 0.0298 AMZN, 2 BUZZ, 1 NIO, and 266 DOGE. I definitely don't know what I am doing but I want to invest more. $500 more or maybe 1k. I know that I want VTI or VOO also.

I know and understand that most people on here are not financial advisors and I know that it is up to me to do my own research BUT I am coming to you all anyway to ask for your help/advice. People are a wealth of information on this app. 

So if you were me, a beginner, with $1000 to invest today, what would you do? Thank you all in advance and I welcome any questions you may have.

EDIT: Wow!!! Thank you all for your responses and information. I've learned a lot of new terminology that I hadn't come across previously, so I am going to look into those as well.

1152,2021-05-02 18:33:56,,RobinHood,"You are taking a logical approach.  Start with a small amount of money and try.  For long term conservative holding, most people buy the big index ETFs that mirror the market as a whole, such as an S&P 500 ETF.  If you are looking to pick and choose individual stocks, buying and selling with any frequency, then proceed with caution.  Try to diversify across industries to reduce risk.

1160,2021-05-03 01:00:08,,RobinHood,"Depends on your risk tolerance. I’m going to assume since you have a substantial savings yet only invested $500 you are either skeptical about stocks or full of shit. I’ll assume the former and we can infer low risk is what you’re looking for at this time due to small starting position. My suggestion is look into “Boomer” stocks. These are stocks like coca-cola, Ford, AT&T, and GE. You won’t see much growth but they have been around forever and can protect your wealth by always being around. If you aren’t so sure about managing your own stocks, valuations, or intrinsic value I’d suggest starting with mutual funds or ETF’s (exchange traded funds). Most mutual funds require a minimum purchase, can only purchase at a set time of day (regardless if it’s the best value for the stocks involved), they are managed by a person or persons, they invest in multiple stocks at once, and have fees with no guarantee of progress. ETF’s are traded on the stock market like stock, they invest in multiple stocks chosen by a person or computer algorithm, the time of purchase is the same time as market hours, they have little to no fee, some ETF’s use leverage which can be dangerous, and generally ETF’s based on indexes are the safest. ETF’s based on index’s like $SPY or $VOO or $QQQ are safe bets. This is since the market established in the late 1800’s it’s had growth. $SPY has an average growth rate of 8% since inception. If you are nearing retirement you might want to lower your risk by moving out of stock positions and into bonds. Both of these markets reflect one another. For specific stock recommendations you should speak with a financial advisor considering your experience level and available funds an advisor would help greatly. Lastly a ROTH IRA can help grow your wealth with stocks. Downsides are you can only invest $6k a year and you can’t take out until your retirement age. The pro’s will tell you put all of your $1000 into one investment because you wouldn’t choose a bad stock to invest in and diversified portfolios are for idiots. I will say I’m not a trading genius so my dumbass has a portfolio diversified over multiple sectors using individual stocks, cryptos, and ETF’s. Lastly this info mainly applies to U.S. citizens trading on the NYSE. Best of luck on your investment journey and don’t believe everything you see on the internet about stocks, best do your own DD.",,,gwqbakj,t3_n3c5ze
1161,2021-05-03 05:15:24,,RobinHood,"Remember that investing requires patience, real investing takes years, really decades, that way compound interest can work its magic. You have plenty of time as long as you don't waste 1p years trying to ""get rich quick""  It also requires cool-headedness. When people are panicking you are looking for buying opportunities, when people are riding high on a single stock, you continue to diversify.

Invest in companies you believe in for the long term, hold on for the ride and add when you beliefs are stronger than ever. Look at market Cap to determine a company's size. Individual share price does not matter, especially with fractional shares available now. Market cap = price per share × total # of shares.

If you want to actively trade and make one day to one year trades I would start with a paper trading account (not real money fake money to practice with) and education is the most important aspect make sure to continue read books watch YouTube and Google anything that doesn't make sense. If you want to do long term or for more then a year read books about those subjects learn as much as possible and if I were you I would stay out of the market for atleast may since may is historically a bad month. Then in June or July start picking long term just maybe put aside 10% of your paychecks untill you start choosing long term and diversify like others said.,,,gwqwfxl,t3_n3c5ze
1166,2021-05-03 16:23:59,,RobinHood,"When I pick a stock, and I’m not an expert either, I have gotten to the decision based on a tiny bit of randomness and mostly research. I joined a bunch of relevant subreddits and will watch the stocks being talked about - not to necessarily buy, but to be able to start picking. Otherwise it’s like letter soup right? Easier to have suggestions and go look them all up from there. Also I try to pay attention to things I like - a year ago AMC was struggling and experts thought they might go broke. AMC is what I’d consider the best chain in the US and I love going to the movies. Even though I’m high risk and can’t get to the movies still for a while, they’re wonderful. I put a little money in there... and over time more and sold some and did it again. I still have like 11 shares I may just never sell at this rate haha. I also love Disney and in spite of them having similar issues, dumped a bit into them too. With excellent results. Anyway my point is you can think about what you normally do or need and where YOU spend money to get inspiration for stocks to check out and possibly buy into. If you’re not into tech but recognize that it’s an area with lots of potential, do your research on ETFs or simply go for long term S&P stuff. You’re likely to trend up if you spread out your money across things that naturally tend to trend up anyway. 

Oh and, if something isn’t performing well, you will need to recognize when to cut losses and when to wait. If it’s a long term investment, hold it, but if you had a shorter term in mind and are down a small percent but want to put money into some other thing, taking a small loss for (hopefully) a decent gain is actually smart. You want your money to work for you.",,,gwsrwae,t3_n3c5ze

There’s always that point where you need to dump and run with a loss or a gain. So get to know the highs and lows of the companies you like. You can’t rely on quarterly reports now a days. So find something that just started growing with a reasonable price. Clean energy , the company CLNE, is growing and its inexpensive. Take a look .",,,gwpkrfh,t3_n3c5ze
1171,2021-05-03 16:16:35,,RobinHood,"The important question that you need to ask yourself is: how much does this 1k mean to you? For some people, 1k is life changing, while for others, this is chump change that they impulse spend on some random crap the day they see it. If you can’t bear to lose this money, then if suggest putting it in some blue chip stocks that’ll have a hard time tanking like SQ, FB, AAPL, PYPL, etc. These stocks might fluctuate a bit more than an index, and are all tech so there’s no diversity, but they have a decently high chance of steadily going up as well. If you plan to continue adding money to this like a retirement fund then you can buy VOO, VTI, SPY, etc, but if this $1000 is for you to  actively trade, then find some stocks you believe in and get your feet wet. $1000 isn’t going to get you far gains wise unless you mess with options, and that very well may be what you do if this is fun money and you don’t care if it disappears. Anyways, your willingness to lose this cash is a large factor in what you should do with it.",,,gwsquc6,t3_n3c5ze
1172,2021-05-03 16:42:07,,RobinHood,"VOO. You get 80% of the U.S. economy, crazy low fees. If VOO goes down, Congress jumps into action to get it back up. It's not like Tesla or any individual company which could go bankrupt and no one would miss it.

Also keep $5 free to do reverse split arbitrage. Sometimes a company will announce that 10 shares will now be consolidated into 1 share, which has the effect of increasing the price per share about 10x. (The exact ratio may differ.) So if you had 10 shares before the split, you'd now have 1 share that's worth ten times as much. That's a reverse split.

If you only had 1 share going in, you'd have 1/10 of a share after, a fraction which historically could not be traded. To get around fractional shares, companies will sometimes pay you the cash value of the fractional share. Other times, though, they will round you up to one full share. When they round up, the share you had bought for $0.50 is now worth around $5. You profit $4.50 with almost no risk.

I post these on Twitter (google it), just follow and turn on notifications. It's a super low risk way to make an extra $10 or $20 a month and get your feet wet trading.",,,gwsugc3,t3_n3c5ze

So the first question you need to answer is: What is your 401k invested in and how much do you have. This counts as the core of your long-term strategy and should effect what choices you make in your taxable account. The next question is how much time will you spend monitoring your investments. This effects what kind of strategies you will want to employ. You also need to determine how much risk you are willing to take. 

Do some reading on different strategies; pick one that sounds like it will fit. Which one doesn't really matter. There are tons of ways to make money in the market, each different strategy will work better in different market environments. Put a small amount of money in and practice.

Don't make a move until you are fairly certain that your action will keep you above 0. Document EVERYTHING, every transaction and make sure you know a) what you currently owe on next year's taxes and b) what your percentage return will be. Work your way up to trying to getting more than a 5% return by learning the market and repeat the actions that will get you the highest returns until you learn something that you know will get you a higher return or help you avoid bringing in a smaller return. Calculate your risk as 1%-2% of your portfolio and never invest more than this in anything speculative or volatile. This includes crypto, NFTs, and anything new that will eventually pop up. Diversify. This has gotten me pretty far.

1214,2021-05-02 17:24:22,n3b99t,RobinHood,"I am setting up a spread for EBAY on Robinhood. EBay just had their quarterly report on 4/29 and their stock dropped by $7.00 to $55.99. I am anticipating it will rise to $56 or higher by 5/21 and opted to go with the following PUT CREDIT spread as follows: 

EBAY
currently $55.99
sell - 14th May - $56.00 - Put 1x100 -$1.16 - $116.00
buy -14th May - $53.00 - Put 1x100 - $0.26 - $-26.00
Total	$90.00 credit

My profit matrix looks like this (link to Options Profit Calculator):
http://opcalc.com/u6D

$90 is my maximum profit for this option trade which is fine for me.

Can I get some feedback if this is the best spread option to apply? (as opposed to a CALL CREDIT spread, iron condor or any other option programs). Are these the optimal expiration dates and strike values to maximize my profit with as little risk as possible?

Brand new Robinhood user here so please be kind!",Need feedback on Put Credit Spread,24.0,,
1215,2021-05-02 19:15:30,,RobinHood,"Everyone has their own strategy and yours is fine. Here's how I look at it. 

With bull puts I don't think much about the stock going higher. I look for ones that I don't think will go lower. So imo Ebay is a good pick. 

Also, because I'm not looking for it to go up, I sell weeklies. Less time for it to go bad, faster time decay.

Then I focus on the break-even point I want. I look at the second lowest resistance level and see if I can find a risk/profit balance around that. With Ebay first resistance is around 55.30, second is about 54.88.

When it comes to picking strikes, I like both to be out-of-the-money with a few strikes between them. The larger spread gives you a lower profit %, but it makes the profit/loss slope longer, giving you more time to decide when to bail if it starts going bad. 

So for Ebay, I would be inclined to pick something like May 7th 55.50/51.50. With the chart I'm looking at that would be max gain 0.53, max loss 3.47. Break even at 54.97. But the profit of 15.27% is a bit low for me so I probably wouldn't do it. 

If I base it off your expected break-even of 55.10, then I would probably pick May 7 55.5/54. BE @ 55.12, 33.93% profit, max profit 0.35, max loss 1.12, probability of profit 60%. Then I'd sell 14 pairs for a credit of 490.

Again this is my current personal way of picking bull credit spreads. It's quite conservative and short-term. In this case Ebay doesn't quite fit my criteria, but it's close and maybe going out two more weeks would make it look better, but I thought it would be helpful to walk through my thought process. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how to pick your spreads with more confidence. 

Final thoughts - see what the sentiment is Monday and if it looks like it hit resistance. Also take a look at more expensive tickers so you don't have to sell as many to get a decent return amount.",,,gwp7424,t3_n3b99t

So it does not matter when it is exercised, only if it is exercised.   If you don't want your shares to be called away, then don't sell a covered call.

I don't worry about the profit I could have got, had I held the shares longer.  Once I sell a covered call, I have already decided on my exit strategy for the security.  I take my profit and move on with my portfolio, I don't dwell on what could have been.",,,gwi96bq,t3_n267my

You can reinvest with instant funds, but selling again before those funds have settled is a no-no. This isn't a brokeage's rule, it's based on the Federal Reserve Board's regulation T.

If you don't have margin and you buy stocks with the unsettled proceeds of another sale, you'll get a freeriding violation (and usually have your account locked) if you sell them again before the funds from the prior sale have settled.",,,gwgj155,t3_n1vszr

1386,2021-04-30 19:45:23,,RobinHood,"The best way to make your profits work for you with a cash account is by setting yourself a certain limit for each day. Being that it takes if I’m not mistaken 72 hours for the funds to settle, by setting a certain amount of money to spend each day, you allow yourself the ability to continuously buy and sell every day of the week without running into any violations. For example if you had $900 that you were going to invest, you could use $300 on Monday, then $300 on Tuesday, and then $300 on Wednesday. By doing this in theory you should be able buy and sell on each one of those days, and by doing so you’ll allow yourself to have funds available while you’re waiting for the proceeds from your initial sale on Monday to settle. Once they clear on Wednesday you are still good to go because you have funds available out of your budget, therefore it’s a continuous cycle.

Freeriding and good faith violations are very similar and both preventable in the same way -- by not selling stock bought with unsettled funds.   I didn't want to complicate my answer with this additional detail, but I should have added it to the ""things to look up"".   

From wikipedia:

""The main difference between a [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) violation and free riding is the eventual deposit of funds to cover the buy. In free riding the buyer sells the security without ever depositing the funds to pay for the initial purchase.

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) considers a good faith violation an ""abuse of credit"" and requires the broker keep track of them. If the trader gets three violations in one year, the broker is required to restrict the account. This is compared to the free riding violation which results in an automatic restriction.",,,gwjlpnb,t1_gwgj155

1414,2021-05-01 05:49:26,,RobinHood,"When I first started trading I was upset by the 25k thing as I sat and watched multiple/different tickers jump 30% in a day, going “look how much I could make if I was able to jump in on just 10% of the run 5 times instead of 3 each week, or even 20 times. Boo no fair”. However, for the poorer investors like myself we struggle with not being greedy and wanting 15% or more. And we miss the the top and it drops quicker than we think it will and oh snap I’m DOWN 10% bail! Then a few minutes later it’s going back up and we jump back in to try to ride it again, but wait it was false. Down another 10%. The ticker is still up 10% on the day, which is good for anyone who was in before the day. But you’re down 20%. Dodge is a great example. I like dodge and do believe it is just getting started. However; on your next day off, take X amount of money you feel like flushing down the toilet, and try to make 40% on the day just jumping in and out in and out. Most likely, you might break even but probably not. It helps us poor guys more than we know. Just my 2 cents. Now why that rule is in place? Idk but I’m personally okay with it.",,,gwii338,t1_gwgmxmb

The 25k thing is arbitrary, but intended to result in fewer uninformed spectators being wiped out. Not sure it functions as intended though. You could replace it with a detailed licensing exam required to open an account, but that would severely impact business. So instead you can do stupid stuff freely, as long as you’ve got enough money for it to be worth the brokers time to field your confused calls.",,,gwguqc4,t1_gwgsh8u

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

You either buy back the stock with this cash (probably at a small loss)    
Or you exercise your pmcc.      
    
You will be covered by the pmcc so the main way you lose money is if the stock drops a lot and your pmcc loses value more than the gain from the short term cc.

Not sure what’s worse, me missing out on that extra $70 in easy money, or watching whoever bought the options miss out on $30 of it (and counting) by sleeping on rise as the stock continues to slide. 

With my luck they’ll fail to execute the option at all and it’ll slide back below $4.5.

I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

A nice safe stock will get you a 10% rate of return to get you to $100K in 46 years. I'm assuming you have a much faster target time frame. That means higher return and that means much higher risk.


So I'll assume you're looking for at least a 20X if not 50X or 100X return in 1-2 years. This is way beyond investment category and even way beyond speculative category, well in to (calculated) gamble territory. It's about 1 step away from taking $1000 to Vegas, or just buying $1000 in scratch-offs. Just so you know the risks. It certainly is NOT an investment, and you should never use that word in describing what you want to do. It's a pure gamble, YOLO bet it all and let it ride type move. You'll never get there by buying/selling a little bit along the way trying to work up to $100K starting with $1000 in a few years. Because if you could, you'd be retired from professional trading by now, and would own your own hedge fund. 


You only have $1,000 and are not a professional trader so you have to bet big and let it ride.  Dogecoin was less than a penny on Jan 1, 2021. Dogecoin, on average in April, had a price in pennies according to the day of April. Roughly speaking it was 5 cents on the 5th, was 20 cents on the 20th, was 30 cents today.  A 30X return since Jan 1, 2021.  It's probably exactly the gamble you're looking for. Big risk, big reward. Put in a buy limit order for $1000 worth of doge at 30 cents and you can hold it until it hits $10 and buy your $100,000+ race car.  Edit: Broke up the wall of text",,,gwgfjsr,t3_n0raqu

It's about 1 step away from taking $1000 to Vegas, or just buying $1000 in scratch-offs.  Just so you know the risks.  It certainly is NOT an investment, and you should never use the word in describing what you want to do.  It's a pure gamble, YOLO bet it all and let it ride type move.  You'll never get there by buying/selling a little bit along the way trying to work up to $100K starting with $1000 in a few years.  Because if you could, you'd be retired from professional trading by now, and would own your own hedge fund.

You only have $1,000 so you have to bet big and let it ride. Dogecoin, on average, had a price in pennies according to the day of April.  Roughly speaking it was 5 cents on the 5th, was 20 cents on the 20th, was 30 cents today. It's probably exactly the gamble you're looking for. Big risk, big reward.  Put in a buy limit order for $1000 worth of doge at 30 cents and you can hold it until it hits $10 and buy your $100,000+ race car.",,,gwgbi9f,t3_n0raqu

1498,2021-04-28 19:41:06,n0mz1n,RobinHood,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part— Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won’t. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I’m tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren’t required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone’s advice works and I get my money back, I’d be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that’s legal. 

tl:dr I believe Robinhood violated my rights when it sold my crypto after the order officially cancelled and restored to my account, and do not know how to proceed",Securities Sold without Permission,26.0,,

1501,2021-04-29 00:29:46,,RobinHood,"I unfortunately think you’re shit out of luck. Like @cardinalnumber said, Robinhood Crypto, LLC isn’t regulated by FINRA. Even if it was, crypto isn’t a security in the first place so you can’t claim to the SEC that they somehow violated a matter of securities ownership. And lastly, when you buy crypto on Robinhood, you don’t actually own the coins, you own a fraction of a pool of coins in a larger wallet. I hate to say this, but I think you have to take the L and learn the lesson: if you want control over your securities/crypto, you need to own it, and Robinhood isn’t the place to own either because neither ever become yours when you trade on their platform.

PS this has happened to me too.

1527,2021-04-28 18:54:15,,RobinHood,"You clearly lack education in regards to business management, finance, and macro economics. 

Business owners regularly forego taking any form of compensation in the interest of the business they operate. As the holder of a non-dividend stock you are effectively that type of owner. Contingencies on holding that share are the board or whoever is tasked with handling the business finance get to make that decision for you. 

If all stocks paid divdends it would normalize share prices, PEs would converge, and prospecting/speculating would be at least inhibited if not impossible. This would likely hinder innovation and stagnate the financial markets. 

If you think there is only value in receiving a dividend, only invest in companies with a stable dividend. 

It is entirely rational, and even ethical, for the end goal of a corporation to not be dividend distribution. In fact, paying a dividend is a strategy to retain shareholders when innovation and growth have stagnated but the company is cash positive. Basically you have all this cash and nothing left to justifiably (or unjustifiably) spend it on; wages are competitive or even industry leading (or at least employee retention is good) so you distribute it to the shareholders. 

Shareholders get paid last almost always. Companies which are not cash positive but continue to pay a dividend have decided to ski a slippery slope that ends in bankruptcy.",,,gw7dxqe,t3_n0jx5i
1528,2021-04-28 22:27:48,,RobinHood,"I agree with a lot of what is said here but let me go a bit more in-depth:

You start a business with some savings you have. You are going from nothing to HOPEFULLY something, but at the beginning you are (hopefully) pumping all of your money back into the company and not taking pay (because you have to innovate, advertise, scale, build inventory, etc.). 

At some point you become somewhat successful but you still aren’t taking any pay, and the company still isn’t turning a profit. You really need investors to help you scale faster and faster and hit critical mass to where you are cash flow positive. You find a VC that loves your company and they give you $$$ for, say, 20% of the company. 

So the VC works with you and you scale and become cash flow positive and now you can afford to pay yourself a small salary but the VC still doesn’t take any money out. At some point you and the VC want to go public to allow investors to buy shares and for you to cash out some from your hard work. You go public, your company trades on the market, and you are happy. 

Nothing has changed. Instead of you and the VC being the only owners, you now have millions of owners. The company is still growing however. Now that you are public ally traded your have a fiduciary duty to manage the firm to the best benefit of your shareholders. As a growth company you are growing 20% YOY, which clearly means the best use of your money is reinvesting in the company to keep growing and making your shares more valuable, thereby returning value to your shareholders. 

At some point you become SO SUCCESSFUL that you are just a cash generating MACHINE. You literally can’t find investments for the cash your company has. (Think of Apple here...which is almost exactly what happened with Apple). At the point where you and your management team can’t create a reasonable return by reinvesting the money into the company (R&D, M&A, etc) then you can return capital to shareholders and allow them to reallocate that money to other profitable investments themselves. 


That is the pretty standard startup -> growth -> value transition process.

You can sell the option whenever for the current market price, which is a function of the stock price, the time to expiration, and the stock's volatility. At expiration, the value is the difference between the stock's market price and the call's strike price.

Buying calls lets you transfer risk of the stock going down to whoever sold the call, while keeping the benefit of the stock going up. In return, the seller charges a premium depending on how likely they are to lose money.",,,gw9ygzz,t1_gw7rtih

1599,2021-04-28 14:20:12,n0fv4o,RobinHood,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

This was for all users in our department, it gave use the ability to see everything about the banking customers: Name, address, SS, balances, transactions, other authorized users, etc. 

Everything we did was tracked and such, but since we were all using the same username there was no way to know which one of us in the department was responsible for which tasks. Lucky for the bank, none of us in our department ever thought to use the info with bad intentions.

So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

1. It is not interest free, you are paying $5 per mo for Gold to get access.  Equivalent to 6% interest on $1000, if my math is correct.
2. If you use the margin, make sure you understand how margin works in relation to your account.  You are correct in stating that if you make a deposit, it will go on the margin balance.  If you have $1000 margin used, and deposit $500, the account will show $500 margin used.",,,gw1m7u1,t3_mzmmp9
1687,2021-04-27 22:18:42,,RobinHood,"You can’t just open the account have no money and just use their money. That’s not how it works. You put in 1k your buying power is now 2k your 1k + Robinhood’s 1k. If you have $10 your buying power is $20 if you have 0 it’s 0! You have 2k buying power and only spend 1200 your using 200 margin if your margin maintenance (minimal account value)needed to avoid them asking for their money back. If buy 1,200 and your margin maintenance is 900 and your account drops below 900 to 750 they can take their money back (margin call) so they would sale enough stocks to equal 200 which would leave you with 550. So betting with the houses money is fun when everybody is winning. However when you lose they will quickly show you that your on your own.",,,gw3s2ez,t3_mzmmp9
1688,2021-04-27 22:48:11,,RobinHood,"  There are pros and cons to using a margin account, for me, and each account is different, but for me on TD Ameritrade I pay 2.5% for the margin I'm using. So for me my returns are out pacing my margin by enough to make it worth while. That can also be written off as a cost to off set capital gains. But I must warn you, please have the money to back up the margin. If you get a margin call you usually only have a day, or less to transfer funds to cover it, or you have to sell something. If you do not, they will start liquating your portfolio until the call is met. Hope that helps.",,,gw3vqld,t3_mzmmp9

1690,2021-04-27 20:14:42,,RobinHood,"Yes depositing cash pays off your margin since all your cash has to be invested and the remainder comes from margin. 

But the first 1,000 isnt really free because you have to have robinhood gold at 60/year to get that 1k of margin so if that's the only reason you are getting robinhood gold and only using 1000 then you are effectively paying 6% interest on it.",,,gw3bdz8,t3_mzmmp9
1691,2021-04-27 21:11:30,,RobinHood,"If the stock does not pay dividends then you have to pay it back in full. 

My strategy for using margin is based upon dividends and future value of a stock. I started to use margin in about 2007 to gain wealth. Bought and shopped  great top stocks, mutual funds, REIT that would pay me a dividend monthly. Even though stocks pay quartly, common stocks will pay for the margin for example: Jan. April, July, Oct as another stock may pay Feb. May. Aug. Nov. As another March, June, Sept. Dec...so  instead of reinvesting those dividends use the dividends to pay part of your margin. Yet plan to sell part of your shares when the value of the stocks reaches peak in some future years. 

I use Morning Star to research but you can use the Yahoo Financial. I as of today I use spreadsheet to keep track of those dividends, value, interest.",,,gw3j7sd,t3_mzmmp9
1692,2021-04-27 22:54:50,,RobinHood,"Oh, you can pay it back by just depositing funds at anytime. If you say buy $500 on margin, and you deposit $500, then you covered the call. Each trading platform is different, so make sure it goes to margin, and not to available cash. On TD Ameritrade say I have $100,000 cash on deposit, my margin account with them would be $100,000, so $200,000 in buying power, if I owned $150,000 in stock, I'd have a $50,000 margin balance. If I deposit an extra $50,000 cash it would bring my margin to zero, and also raise my margin availability to $150,000. Sorry I never answered about paying it back part of your question.",,,gw3wk3g,t3_mzmmp9

1698,2021-04-27 18:28:50,,RobinHood,"Yeah, you add money and once it settles, it’s deducted from your margin balance. 

So you use 1000 in margin, add 800, once it clears the next day likely, maybe 2-3, your margin will then show 200. 

And even if you have the money elsewhere, say everything is cut in half tomorrow at open, it’s not going to give you time to pay. Once you hit your margin maintenance level, it’s going to start selling stocks till you’re below it, likely the higher requirement, riskier assets first.",,,gw2wabd,t3_mzmmp9

1705,2021-04-27 16:37:02,,RobinHood,"To add to this great advice, you don’t wanna invest anyone’s money but your own, especially if you’re on the newer side. Between tax liabilities and potential losses, you don’t wanna owe anyone else, especially if you don’t have much to invest in the first place

Some of the big CryptoTwitter influencers will flex their margin skills, but they have all explained that they started with money they were willing to lose, and many of them got liquidated (100% loss to pay back the margin debt) or lost 90% or so very early on, before they got to their current positions.

If this is money you can’t afford to lose, then you shouldn’t be investing it in things as risky as crypto or, some would even say not to put it in stocks. But if this is money you’re prepared to lose, then that’s a tougher decision you have to make, whether you’re truly prepared to lose it or something less",,,gw2g9n6,t1_gw23ton

It’s similar to taking a loan from you bank but it’s less risky for the lender because they have your stocks as collateral. Using margin has its risk but can be pretty effective. The odds are pretty good if you just look at the last 10 years. Margin can also give you cash flow during dips to buy more shares if you don’t want to sell other positions.",,,gw3g7wy,t1_gw23ton

I’ve seen post about people have millions on their accounts, so that has made me feel better. But what about $100’th of millions? Like how well are our accounts backed? I just want to rest assure that if I hit a huge trade that I am backed. Crypto is something completely different and I understand that. This is in regards to stocks. 

For an example, if GameStop goes to a million a share (this is an example only), will I be guaranteed that I can SELL and my sort to speak, tendies be guaranteed?

So ignoring whether GME will hit infinity/share-- just hypothetically:

IF a stock hits $1M+ per share, WILL Robinhood:

A) Allow us to sell our shares  
B) Be able to pay us for said shares?

1802,2021-04-27 15:42:12,,RobinHood,"I think you get it now based on the comments. In case you don't:

Imagine you go to the store and you write a check to pay for groceries. And then you forget and buy a PS5 and then have no money in your bank account. The grocery store just got screwed over by you when the check bounces right - you just stole groceries. The grocery store may now say ""hey from now on if you write a check you have to guarantee there's enough to pay for it"". This is what's happening with Robinhood, and all brokers.

Let's use the broker now. If you have $500 with them, let's say Robinhood, and you want to buy a stock for $200 and another stock for $150. When you place the order for the first stock worth $200 let's assume no one else is selling, so there's an open order you've placed for $200 for 1 stock. When you go to place the order for the second stock, your available balance you can use will be $300 (the 500 minus the 200 for the open order). Why? Well if you say place an order for 3 of the $150 stock AND it goes through, that's like you buying the PS5. You'll have spent $450 and only have $50 left, now that first order for $200 you can't actually afford it, Robinhood doesn't want to be the grocery store (no brokers do). Now if someone else now accepts your order for the first stock worth $200 who pays for it? You certainly can't you only have $50 left. To avoid this, while you have the open order for the first stock worth $200, if you try to place another order your available balance will be $300 to make sure you can pay for the first set of groceries. So no, Robinhood didn't ""take"" your money. Your money's locked away for the order until either the order goes through or you cancel it.",,,gw28fuf,t3_mz5fmw

So let’s say you place your limit at .25 USD per Dogecoin... and you pay Robinhood $1,000.00 for this limit order...
If Dogecoin is currently priced at .269 USD per Dogecoin, you aren’t going to see the $1,000.00 in your buying power because you cannot use it. It is essentially queued up waiting for 1 Dogecoin to fall to .25 USD and if it does and there are available sellers, THEN your $1,000.00 is spent on the Dogecoin and you will see it reflected on your account.

You can cancel a limit order at any time before your limit set is reached... *and* it will automatically be cancelled after a certain amount of time anyway if the price never drops to your set limit.

But keep in mind, if the price **does** drop to .25 USD per Dogecoin... your money will be spent if sellers are available (and there will be most likely lol) and then your money is invested and there’s no going back. Then you are playing the Doge game! Lmfao. Until you decide to sell of course. In that case you will get back whatever returns you have on the Dogecoin, be it negative or positive... **and** this is assuming someone wants to buy your Dogecoin. So don’t set a limit price too low. Because then you’re pretty much setting up an automatic buy-in in the event of the collapse of Dogecoin LOL. Be reasonable with your limits.",,,gw51cxk,t3_mz5fmw

The money wasn’t available and the doge wasn’t in your account because the order you placed could NOT be filled. Meaning that even though you were willing to buy 656 at about $0.15 a coin, nobody was willing to sell at that low of a price. Therefor, the order is not filled. 

Not trying to be mean, but it REALLY sounds like you need to learn the basics of stocks/trading and what it means to buy and sell. To put it plainly, I can’t walk into a Microsoft store and buy an Xbox for $50, because they aren’t going to sell the Xbox for that low of a price. Same process behind stocks & crypto.

If you really want to pay the last price, you need to let the world know that by setting a limit at that price.

1904,2021-04-26 18:50:31,mz4w4z,RobinHood,"Hey guys! New to the subreddit, been a lurker on WSB for a long time and discovered this place from In The Money's channel :D This is my first due diligence so feel free to give me any feedback.

**-Why ETF's-**

The truth is, 89% of fund managers fail to beat the market.

According to this report, 88.99% of large-cap US funds have underperformed the S&P500 index over ten years. Knowing this, why do we as individual investors still try to beat the market as opposed to ETF investing? Overconfidence perhaps? Not sure. My main investment is SPY leaps but besides that I have one other secret ETF that has made me very rich...

**-Why investing in a water(liquid gold) ETF could make you rich!-**

I've spent hours upon hours scouring the web for an ETF that I feel could reliably beat the S&P 500 consistently and I think I've found one(two actually). PHO and FIW, two etf's focused on water conservation and infrastructure.

About 70% of the earth's surface is covered in water, but 97% of it is saltwater, which is unfit for human use. Saltwater cannot be used for drinking, crop irrigation, or most industrial uses. Of the remaining 3% of the world's water resources, only about 1% is readily available for human consumption. This creates a demand for desalination infrastructure to solve the global water crisis as the population of the world rapidly rises by the day.

I was watching a TED talk that said in the future, wars will be waged over water. It simply isn't easy to transport and some areas have a lot more than others. For example, everything from steel to potato chips to computers uses water in the production. Did you know that we use 2400 liters of water to produce just one hamburger?

In fact, water futures were created last December because of the growing interest in water investing. If you look at the 13F filings on Whalewisdom you can see that water is also one of the fastest growing sectors among hedge funds.

**-The Big Short-**

I don't know if you guys remember, but Michael Burry said at the end of The Big Short that he is focused only on investing into water. The more due diligence I do on water(Ted talks, books, articles) the more I realize just how right Michael Burry is about this. Michael Burry is also investing in Farmland, along with Bill Gates who is now the world's biggest farmland owner. In addition, water will benefit from the imminent rising inflation due to the fed's QE. After all, it's an essential commodity.

**-Can't be replaced-**

Unlike tech companies which may go out of favor, water will always be essential and relevant to our lives. As the population of the world increases, tendies will flow into our pockets. I almost see this as a no-lose scenerio. Desalination is a necessity, there's no other way around it. The population growth creates the demand, and a growing population is easier to rely on than trying to anticipate consumer demand for something like Apple!

**-Very cheap leaps-**

As of now, you can get $5200 worth of leaps options on PHO for $200-300. Considering this has been rapidly outperforming the SPY, this is a tremendous bargain! FIW is actually better than PHO when you consider performance, however the options are less liquid. I would recommend FIW if you can find a decent price, otherwise PHO should suit you fine.

**-Conclusion-**

I'd advise everyone to do their own research. There's some fancy graphs and TED talk videos on Youtube. Blackrock and other top ETF's know about water and are highly invested. This ETF is one

of the secrets to my success for the last few years(the other being poor man's covered call on certain stable/fed-backed ETF's under low volatility). Other commodity/real estate etf's are also worth looking into(DBA, WOOD, DBC, REIT's) as an inflation hedge and for diversification. I'm looking forward to being an active contributor to this discord! :D",This ETF outperformed SPY!(Investing in water),0.0,,

My retirement $$$ is in my boring retirement Vanguard acct... set and forget. My joy is meandering through the stock market  generally buying longterm at least for 1 year due to tax implications. But most held for a lot longer.

For me I don't want it to become a job or stress me out. I want to learn and I want it to be fun. I jumped into Bitcoin and held for a long time and cashed out with a tidy profit to do something else. My husband has his own money and we have much different styles. But I jumped into dogecoin with my brother as a sibling type rivalry thing and it gave us something in common and something to rib each other about. He bowed out. I sold enough to cover taxes and my cost and I'm up $1,800. Even if I lose the rest, I really didn't lose. I'll sell a bit more if it goes to $0.50 and let the rest ride. Sister is coming out on top!

 I still have single shares of some stocks because I was too poor to buy more and it feels good to see 1 share of NVIDIA purchased @ $89...  it's like looking back at your kindergarden photos, I also have 21 shares of NVAX @ $4.47, 14 shares of SQ @$15... wish I had bought more but it is what it is. Lessons big and small. It also reminds me means I did some stuff right even on a tiny scale.

All time returns since 2016 I am at 330% balance around 15.5k

Take some small risks but this should not be with your rent money, use discretionary money that you can afford to lose and set a weekly amount and stick to it.  I started at around $12 a week. Patience and consistency is key but so is the enjoyment. I hope you have fun with it!",,,gw0h15w,t3_mz02ef

In fact, just because I've seen this thing happen a bunch, I actually bought some $1p 5/21 expecting it to go down in the next few weeks.

I think it has potential for being a decent strategy for new investors, if you are willing to do the research to understand the methods and you are extremely good at sticking to the rules of momentum investing.

With meme stocks it pays to buy them before the craze. I bought dogecoin at .069420 because I thought it was funny and because it had been stagnant for a while.

As another example, I bought Amazon after they announced they're acquiring Whole Foods because their stock remained stagnant at just under $1000 for weeks after the news and I had a feeling that the newly added value would be recognized eventually.

As a third example I bought some weed stocks recently such as YOLO. They're down about 33% - I bought at 30, it's at 20 - but I have a good feeling that they'll come back up in the long run.

If that’s really your entire annual income then you’d owe no federal tax. Depending on the state that may be true for your state taxes too. Search “<your state> standard deduction” and see.

Standard deduction is basically an amount you subtract from your income before calculating taxes. For federal 2020 it’s like $12,400. So if you make $3000 then $3000-$12400 is less than $0 so no tax! If you made $20,000 then $20,000-$12,400=$7,600 and you’d owe tax on that $7,600 amount (you’d look up $7600 in the tax table and pay whatever it said is the tax for that).

You don't have to pay taxes at all if you make under 12,000.

""As long as you don't have a type of income that requires you to file a return for other reasons, like self-employment income, generally you don't need to file a return as long as your income is less than your standard deduction.

For example, in 2020, you don't need to file a tax return if all of the following are true for you:

* Under age 65
* Single
* Don't have any special circumstances that require you to file (like self-employment income)
* **Earn less than $12,400 (which is the 2020 standard deduction for a single taxpayer)""**

And in most states taxes are due quarterly so if you realized gain in Jan you'd owe taxes on those profits wherever your Q1 tax payments are due. If you don't pay until you file your federal return at the end of the year you'll owe non payment penalties.

The vast majority of people work for a company that withholds and sends your tax payments to the government on a regular basis. But independent contractors, small business owners, gig workers, and cash employees have always been responsible for sending quarterly tax payments on their income.

2053,2021-04-26 21:21:33,,RobinHood,"Taxable income = short term salary income + short term capital gains from <1 year stock position + long term capital gains from >1 year stock position.

Taxable income determines whether your long term gains is taxed at 0% or 15%. Fed taxes is zero for the first 40k of long term capital gains. 

I didn't make any money from a job last year. So, my taxable income = 0 + 0 +  long term capital gains of 40k.

Let's use an example of someone with 35K salary, 2k stock short term gains and 10k long term gains

The salary and stock short term gains will be taxed like normal income. This amounts to 37k. Now you have space for $3k worth of long term capital gains left. 

The first 3k will be taxed at 0%, while the next 7k will be taxed at 15%.

In other words, there's actually an incentive in the Fed Taxation rule for you to avoid realizing short term gains or have a regular job.

A jobless retiree with a massive portfolio of stocks can just slowly sell off 40K of stocks every year for your living expense with zero fed tax, and zero state tax (assuming you live in a tax free state). Also, this 40k number keeps increasing by a few hundred dollars too. Use that free money and live in a 3rd world country where expenses are 1/10 of the US. 

You said that you live in CA like me, so we both are screwed by the capital gains taxation of California. Short term/long term capital gains are treated identically, which is why I am paying that $800+. Definitely considering to move to Nevada soon, where that number is 0.",,,gvz7amm,t1_gvv8dsb
