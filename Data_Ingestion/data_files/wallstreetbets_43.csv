is the movement we're seeing this week a Squeeze? Or a legit response to the reopening plans in the US which should see a legitimate drive to people returning to the theatre.

Either way, I think AMC overall is a good stock to invest in. at least the next year. Even if this is just a short squeeze, AMC SHOULD do very well once pandemic closures are over and we can watch movies in theatres again.

Even the novelty of it should drive revenues up and the stock price for the next few months while these opening plans resume.

Hints are that my broker is starting to play tricks again but so far no hard to borrow charges on GME.  Problem is AMC in the 20's makes sense if people start going back to theaters.  Many Wokesters see nothing wrong with Kowtowing to China as Cena did--he should do ALL his future pictures exclusively in Mandarin.

But GME at 235?  Ridiculous. In 2 years and 11 months it will be trading at 160 on its fundamentals alone!  But not 235--unless we have drastic inflation.  Ford Motor used to sell Roadsters at 295--several models in the mid-3-digits.  Price levels were different.

Before the lockdowns and closing, the narrative was that theatres and the big box office experience was dying. People were opting to sit at home and watching new releases on their couches.

we've now been doing that for 15 months straight. 

At least for the next 6 months, I predict a lot of people are going to go to the movies purely to get out. To have an experience they couldn't have for the last 1.5 years. will that sustain AMC long term? I have no fucking clue. But I expect the EOY Financials for AMC to show a massive spike in Revenues at least for the short term

But for a meme stock like AMC I don't even know. Maybe a later expiration date? I would assume that the 30-45 day period would be enough for most stocks to normalize but with meme stocks you never know. Buying puts with the premium is not a bad idea either. I might do the same in your position.",,

isn't it obvious: when you're an experienced crook crashing the market, like Ken, you want to have an excuse prepared, like blaming it on the ""meme stocks"". you wouldn't wanna restrict only GME, just to show everyone your hand and give away your weak spot? nah, you're smarter than that and as it happens, you already have a few pump & dumps up your sleeve because, you know, that's what you do.

I said their business model will enable them to be far more profitable than any other automaker, not that they are currently.

Clearly if FSD works out, and frankly as an ""automaker"" they are the only one positioned I think to solve it (and I think in general compared to anyone else they are also better positioned here) the profits from that alone would dwarf any automaker's profits.

Besides that, their vertical integration, which they are well ahead of anyone else in that regard, from the manufacturing of parts that go into the car to selling cars direct means a more efficient pipeline and less places to share profits with.

On the battery front, they already are assumed to have the cheapest costs and with the 4680 batteries and the future development they laid out they may be headed to $50 per kWh, whereas others will be paying, perhaps double that amount for batteries.

Their build process is becoming more efficient and cheaper. For example converting the front and back to single casts eliminates 2/3rds (about 600 robots) of your body shop. That means less overhead costs, parts, and inherently a better car build.

Their battery efficiency, which will increase significantly with the 4680 cells and single casts, means less kWh's needed per car, which saves even more money.

I really did not want to get into details of this, rather my point was simply I think they will be more profitable, but from the above you can see some of my thought process here. I would think in every aspect listed above they are years ahead of any competitors. That translates into bigger than ordinary profits I think.

Beyond the above, their efforts in Energy storage and Solar Power should continue to see strong growth and as well that will translate into higher profits. EV's necessitate the need for home or grid energy storage and green energy production, so they both should see strong growth. Finally, we can get speculative, and wonder if they incorporate star link communications into their cars somehow to provide connectivity anyplace in the world. This is perhaps key to self-driving, especially if you are going to have cars driving in places where  the carriers have no service.",,

After that, the share price started declining due to some uncertainty. But a few weeks ago they announced to present the 9-month data set on a huge scientific conference in July.

For me that's a very very positive signal! Just imagine - would you present a failure on such a big stage? Certainly NO! Personally I used this opportunity to buy more shares.

The anticipation of the data release has already started but I am still adding below 60$. The CEO already spreaded some excitement about the data. He didn't want to ""spill the beans yet"", since Cassava is not allowed to publish the new study data before the conference. 

I am actually super bullish on this and can't wait to see the new data.

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

https://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

https://preview.redd.it/sz9ubhkslo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=43812473c30a230ed2108ef37c6954bb2e3cda64

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**

**XLK -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

**XLY -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

Wanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.

**MU –- PCS – 7/16 @ 0.7 delta for credit > 1/3 strike width**

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;
* TAM $190bn
* Newly formed entity has no Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents \~$650m.
* Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with 41% Gross Margin.

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

5231,,2021-05-27 17:42:04,t3_nmcz56,,wallstreetbets,"Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I’m betting on EVs.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 17 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 19. Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.50, with a median of 16.41.

Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 1.09. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.58.

These are only a few of the key metrics included in Nokia's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, NOK looks like an impressive value stock at the moment. 🤑🤑🤑",nmdhm1,$NOK to Mars!
5237,,2021-05-27 18:06:29,t3_nmdjep,,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this.",nmdjep,My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently

I didn't help that--I made 6249 in four shorts--my first ever since my late brother took me with him to his brokers to absorb the lesson that you could lose 8500 in shorting Gulf & Western--that was in 1968 when that was a lot of money.  Now you know why I didn't short until this year--GME was just at ridiculous prices for now and demanded I sell short screeching its lungs out.

   BTW I do hate hedge funds because they are in fact Stock Market Pools and thus have been illegal since 1934.  Don't Tax Then--BUST 'EM!  Right now I lose only if I have to cover above 234 and I figure GME will go below that--its floor remember is 157: 550 million divided by 3.5 million shares.  It's a debt-free company with 300 million to spend making good with new managers that know how do that--it will just take them three years to get GME to sell at 160 on fundamentals which drive the technicals anyways.  AMC won't have a theater on the moon before 2061 for the vacation market.  AMC will have Mars theaters before 2100 if settlements get large enough; GME will serve both markets better than AMC for entertainment anyways.",,

After that, the share price started declining due to some uncertainty. But a few weeks ago they announced to present the 9-month data set on a huge scientific conference in July.

For me that's a very very positive signal! Just imagine - would you present a failure on such a big stage? Certainly NO! Personally I used this opportunity to buy more shares.

The anticipation of the data release has already started but I am still adding below 60$. The CEO already spreaded some excitement about the data. He didn't want to ""spill the beans yet"", since Cassava is not allowed to publish the new study data before the conference. 

I am actually super bullish on this and can't wait to see the new data.

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

https://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

https://preview.redd.it/sz9ubhkslo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=43812473c30a230ed2108ef37c6954bb2e3cda64

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**

**XLK -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

**XLY -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

Wanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;
* TAM $190bn

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 17 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 19. Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.50, with a median of 16.41.

Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 1.09. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.58.

These are only a few of the key metrics included in Nokia's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, NOK looks like an impressive value stock at the moment. 🤑🤑🤑",nmdhm1,$NOK to Mars!
7147,,2021-05-27 18:06:29,t3_nmdjep,,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this.",nmdjep,My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently

so ive taking a huge break from trading AMC and GME. I made a profit but focused more on PLTR, AAPL and bunch of tech stocks.

But somehow I found myself back into AMC and actually bought right when market opened 5 contracts @ $19 strike. You can already assume my happiness right now lol

I feel like this wont end anytime soon too. Not really sure what and when the major short squeeze is, but can some kindly ELI5 when it will be? Also what price pt are we realistically selling at?

Now as far as there being collusion and a coordinated effort? I can't say, there's no mention of conversations between firms. But seeing as literally every single major firm and bank has similar, frequent violations in the last 12 years, it looks as though there is no need for collusion. It's just an unspoken rule they all know — purposely misreport your numbers to make a ton of money, and pay the miniscule fine to the company who takes 4 years to bring those violations to light anyways and buries them in boring legal jumbo.

I couldn't tell you which hedge funds are working together. But you can guarantee that anyone short on GME or AMC right now is absolutely misreporting numbers to try and stay alive a little longer.",,

That Tesla has laid out and is taking open concrete steps (e.g. their Texas factory that is being built is already producing single casts, likely for process and material testing right now) towards building cars that will be class leading for years to come is not relevant?

Agree, disagree, whatever. Just consider that every car company is trying to show their ""Tesla Killer"" without mentioning Tesla. They are terrified. Not sure why anyone would assume that Tesla is not a threat to the entire industry and decades of experience will win. Decades of experience building engines and transmissions are near worthless for EV's... Frankly the whole car (listen to Mr. Rawlinson from Lucid who mentions this) for an EV can be built differently, so not sure how important decades of experience building ICE vehicles helps in building EV's.

OLO / Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp short borrow fee rates are shown in the following table. This table shows the interest rate that must be paid by a short seller of US:SOLO to the lender of that security. This fee is shown as an annual percentage rate (APR). Lenders are funds or individuals that own the security that have indicated to the broker that they are willing to lend it out. Dividends paid to a shorted security go to the owner/lender of the security, not to the borrower.

Secondly, most of what you guys consider due diligence has none of the characteristics of DD, it's typically not reproducible and has emotional reasoning.

If you have a source to provide, then please do provide it, I'd love to see it. But just vaguely quoting ""the DD"" has about as much of an effect as quoting ""the Bible"" instead.

And yes, I'm well aware that FINRA takes years to finish investigating. That's why I'm just so curious about how you apparently know nothing changed about their behavior and that they're doing it now. It must be a hell of a source that you have. Too bad you still haven't shared it.

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed. 

Thanks for understanding, and may your tendies be golden, and portfolio be green.

But that is true of any place where people are, which doens't mean we should accept it. My point is if you are willing to pay $7.00 for netflix your taxes as a services can be viewed the same way.
