New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell √¢¬Ä¬úPink No Information√¢¬Ä¬ù securities, including at E*TRADE 

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for√¢¬Ä¬îand value of√¢¬Ä¬îcertain √¢¬Ä¬úover-the-counter (OTC) securities√¢¬Ä¬ù you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to √¢¬Ä¬úPink No Information√¢¬Ä¬ù OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E*TRADE from making these products generally available. 

Some background on the new requirements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements. 

Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected. 

What these changes mean for you 

Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell √¢¬Ä¬úPink No Information√¢¬Ä¬ù OTC securities through E*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any √¢¬Ä¬úPink No Information√¢¬Ä¬ù OTC securities you hold now or in the future. 

Here√¢¬Ä¬ôs how to get more information about these changes and how they might affect you:
	
	Understand the SEC amendments for OTC securities
	Learn more about quotations for OTC securities

As always, thank you for choosing E*TRADE. It is our privilege to serve you.",nga33y,IMPORTANT upcoming changes to OTC TRADING RULES on ETrade

The volume has been supressed for a year which is the average shown but historically was much higher. For example in 2008 when oil went on a large run the daily volume reached +3M at one point. When price for oil is high and the dividend is fully restored the average volume was around 400k/day and spikes of +1M with a trading price of $17-22 or $6.8-8.8M/day.

Also if you refer to my original post, a good portion of shares are institutional or wrapped in a 1031 through a corporation. I learned about the 1031 connection through some business associates I have in the Permian Basin that have done this when selling their real estate and parking the capital during down turns.

Since [Cathie Wood has decided recently to weigh in on oil prices.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3694761-arks-cathie-wood-weighs-in-on-oil-sees-70-ceiling) I have a history of betting against Cathie, feel free to search my post history, as I called the top of ARKK with some extensive DD and made a nice profit from that analysis. WSB called me crazy while my puts printed huge. As we all know inflation is here to stay and commodities will be a strong long term play.

**My Price Target** for the month of June based on the above reasoning is **$17** and a continued upside of **$17-21** through August without any sort of volume manipulation or option squeeze.

I'm targeting a **300-400% increase** in the underlying stock price by August if Oil prices remain where they are or near $70.

**Current Position**

In all transparency this is less than 10% of my overall account. 2020 was really good to me on investing in value plays and shorting some of the biggest bubbles in March(see my ARKK post). However I believe that if your going to give advice you have to have some skin in the [game to give clear advice](https://discord.com/channels/506998257247846423/506998257789173772/844388063820251177)

Since my last post **$PBT** is up 10.9% without any of the major catalysts being met as they roll in the next few months. It's better to be early before the big moves and that's what I'm outlining below.

My current position is heavy at

200 Sept 17 C5

175 Sept 17 C7.5

90,204 shares

I have based some of my findings for my PT on a related royalty trust TPL that has had a run recently due to large oil production output but lower overall oil pricing during its run. TPL went from $480-1710(2.5x) in the past 5 months off the same principles outlined for **$PBT**, except **$PBT** lagging in production coming online with higher oil prices leads me to believe a larger upside is possible. Other royalty trusts I ran through my models include MVO, SJT, and SBR with **$PBT** being by far the most to gain on the upside of the underlying stock price and possibly the most pure penny stock oil play.

**Increase In Dividend**

For the month of May PBT has increased its dividend month on month by 17% to $0.021243 per unit. 

https://preview.redd.it/9dnzhq2wbzz61.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=14bf0cb8a90a11a25b9dc3390be1902d3d8203d7

It's important to note that **$PBT** current dividend is still below pre Pandemic levels that dropped in March due to low Oil demand. Current demand for oil is increasing quickly with the reopening and **$PBT** has a monthly dividend which allows for a continued catalyst through the next 3-4 months.

Average dividend payout is show below based on oil prices per year

**FORM 10-Q Released on May 17(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000319654/000119312521163404/d492204d10q.htm)**

>For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, royalty income received by the Trust amounted to $2,124,157 compared to royalty income of $6,254,509 during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in royalty income is primarily attributable to increased drilling costs on the Waddell Ranch properties resulting in a deficiency for the NPI, therefore, no royalties were paid, despite an increase in oil production and an increase in the price of gas for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2020.  
>  
>Royalty income for the Trust for the first quarter of the calendar year is associated with actual oil and gas production for the period of **November and December 2020 and January 2021** from the properties from which the Trust‚Äôs net overriding royalty interests (‚ÄúRoyalties‚Äù) were carved.

Current income is based on a lagging price of oil for the months currently ending in January. Oil Prices for the 3 months of the 10-Q averaged $44.08 per Bbl compared to the current price of $64.90 at today's closing.

A higher amount of drilling coupled with the lower oil prices prior to Feb spike has kept the dividend to a lower calculation. The 10-Q shows that production costs associated with the operator on record are bringing new wells online at a time when oil prices are skyrocketing.

>Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the first quarter of 2021 totaled $9.5 million as compared to $528,000 for the first quarter of 2020. Blackbeard has previously informed the Trustee that the 2021 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $88.6 million (gross) ($32.5 million net to the Trust) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The total amount of capital expenditures for 2020 with regard to the Waddell Ranch properties totaled $10.4 million (gross).   
>  
>The Trustee has been advised that there were 27 workover wells completed, 8 new wells completed, 8 new wells in progress and 9 workover wells in progress during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to no workover wells completed, no new wells completed, no new wells in progress and no workover wells in progress for the three months ended March 31, 2020, on the Waddell Ranch properties. There were various facility projects in progress for the first quarter of 2021.

The production value being added to **$PBT** is at the highest it has been in almost a decade. Above shows the large portion of capex is being used through the month on Jan 2021 based on the 10-Q and current unknown expenditures for the past 2 months are calculated on the oil trust dividend payments.

**$PBT** has been lagging behind other royalty trusts in the market due to a production holds on Oil Prices that could allow for it's dividend payment to grow exponentially. 

**WTI Crude Oil Price outlook**

Oil prices have been on a run in early 2021 up until recently with new COVID scares slowing the explosive price action. However, most economies are still opening up faster than ever and vaccinations and summer months should help ease some of these worries. A recent article has Goldman predicting Oil will reach $80 in the near future

US imports plunge to lowest levels since 1973 from OPEC

[https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Imports-From-OPEC-Plunge-To-Lowest-Since-1973.amp.html](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Imports-From-OPEC-Plunge-To-Lowest-Since-1973.amp.html)

Royalty Trusts are the few true Oil plays related directly to Oil price and production since they carry little to no debt. Historically **$PBT** stock price large increases in a short period are due to a spike in dividend that is related to the sale of Crude Oil on the market price. Since the price to produce the oil doesn't vary much, a higher price over a certain threshold always produces a much larger dividend.

**PBT Production Outlook**

Based on my analysis, I believe **$PBT** has a production windfall coming into a supply squeeze in the coming months that will lead to an extremely large jump in dividend payouts and a large price increase if played correctly by investors. **$PBT** has one of the largest land holdings for a royalty trust at 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres, roughly calculated based on recent lease acquisitions to a total value of $3.14B while trading on a market cap of $175M due to low dividend payout since COVID shutdowns and low production output. 

Royalty income received by the Trustee for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $112,341,696 compared  to $12,585,688 in 2020. Since the formula to calculate the dividend still depends on the operators expenses and the operator has a large  planned expenditures budget of $37.7M to bring on more production that  has been decreasing since 2010; I'm assuming the outlook for production  will be very high for these leases +1.2M barrels of crude and +4M mcf of  Natural Gas which is more average for years 2008-2010 as opposed to  2019(pre COVID) output of 831k/3.5M.

Though there seems to be a large capex budget for 2021 at $86.7M, we have already seen 3 months of these expenses adjusted into the dividend payout. US shale are tight plays with short lifespan on wells, so if the  operator and trust aren't drilling and completing wells then production  can fall off quickly within 6 months. The costs associated with the new  wells and the 10 already complete since last year should increase production while leveraging potentially very high oil and gas prices  near term. As opposed to a small Oil company looking to leverage their  services in the sector for possibly only a short term with rising oil  prices.

**Land Leases**

Expanding on the production costs already assumed by the new operator costs for **$PBT** as of April 2020 and the new supply/demand coming online since COVID is decreasing. I wanted to share the EIA visual data I found for the past decade that shows oil output for the region that most of **$PBT** has their leases on.

**TLDR:** $PBT is currently a low volume mid cap pure mineral rights Oil play that isn't prone to bankruptcy. It has lagged the Oil market due to production output and Oil pricing leaving their dividend to be low. Current finished projects from 2020 when oil prices were suppressed should make the dividend pop and lead to a huge increase in volume that historically pushes the stock price up dramatically short term. With a fairly cheap options chain available for a larger than anticipated move over the next couple months could print major.",nfsxep,PBT (Oil penny play) - Extensive DD Updated with new 10-Q and Dividend on lagging post COVID sector recovery.

 MONTR√âAL, May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (‚ÄúNouveau Monde‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (TSXV: NOU, OTCQX: NMGRF, FSE: NM9) is pleased to announce that it has received approval for the listing of its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (‚ÄúNYSE‚Äù). The Company expects its common shares will open for trading on the NYSE on May 24, 2021, under the symbol ‚ÄúNMG‚Äù.  


***Arne H Frandsen, Chairman of Nouveau Monde, commented:*** ‚ÄúAn extraordinary journey has just achieved another milestone. As Chairman, I am so proud of the Nouveau Monde team, and how we have so promptly secured a listing on the world‚Äôs largest and most important capital market, namely the New York Stock Exchange. This comes as we have commenced the work on our Phase 1 beneficiation plant, which early in 2022 is expected to start producing battery grade shaped, purified and coated graphite. We remain committed to becoming North America‚Äôs largest fully integrated anode material production facility, and ultimately delivering our critical materials with zero carbon footprint from our Qu√©bec-based facilities.*‚Äù*

***Eric Desaulniers, President and CEO of Nouveau Monde, added:*** ‚ÄúAs the Western World‚Äôs economy is on the verge of a major industrial shift driven by the electrification of transportation and energy storage systems, the entire Nouveau Monde team is thrilled to play a meaningful role in the sustainable extraction and transformation of an essential battery material to help make this revolution possible. Nouveau Monde is a true North American story of local security of supply, full traceable verticalization, carbon-neutrality, lot-by-lot consistency and long-term cost structure resilience. We are striving to advance, one milestone at a time, towards our objective of establishing our company as a leading supplier of battery material.‚Äù

**Additional Information for Shareholders**

In addition to listing and trading on the NYSE in U.S. dollars, Nouveau Monde‚Äôs common shares continue to be listed and trade on the TSX Venture Exchange (‚ÄúTSXV‚Äù) in Canadian dollars under the symbol ‚ÄúNOU‚Äù. Shareholders that purchased their Nouveau Monde common shares on the TSXV and, in connection with the NYSE listing, wish to trade in U.S. dollars are advised to contact their broker for more information.

Shareholders that purchased their Nouveau Monde common shares ‚Äúover-the-counter‚Äù or OTC, including shareholders whose shares are denoted in their institution/broker account with the symbol ‚ÄúNMGRF‚Äù, are advised to monitor their account to ensure their holdings are updated to reflect the NYSE listing and trading symbol, as the Company expects OTC quotations for Nouveau Monde common shares to cease in connection with the NYSE listing. Shareholders are advised to contact their broker for more information if they have questions in this regard.

Nouveau Monde‚Äôs common shares will also continue to trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol ‚ÄúNM9‚Äù.

**About Nouveau Monde**

Nouveau Monde is striving to become a key contributor to the sustainable energy revolution. The Company is working towards developing a fully-integrated source of green battery anode material in Qu√©bec, Canada. Targeting commercial operations by 2023, the Company is developing advanced carbon-neutral graphite-based material solutions for the growing lithium-ion and fuel cell markets. With low-cost operations and enviable ESG standards, Nouveau Monde aspires to become a strategic supplier to the world‚Äôs leading battery and automobile manufacturers, providing high performing and reliable advanced materials while promoting sustainability and supply chain traceability.",ngcobb,"Nouveau Monde Has Successfully Been Admitted and Will Commence Trading on the NYSE on Monday, May 24, 2021"

Drones are a disruptive technology and for any disruptive technology to be successful - it should be commercially viable. DDC‚Äôs entire ecosystem is planned, tested, and operated to:

1. Offer end-to-end drone delivery service from software to hardware to professional services.
2. Scale and be remotely controlled from one location i.e. Vaughan which can operate 1500 drones at full capacity and at $10K fees/drone/route/month would mean $180M for DDC in annual revenues
3. The drones are capable of handling extreme weather conditions, remote locations with limited internet, etc. 
4. Cater to multiple and critical business requirements like mining locations, oil rigs, healthcare for supplying medicines and other critical equipment, or for other logistic requirements that we have discussed throughout the video.",ngd4nz,Drone Delivery Canada is World's One-Stop-Shop for Drones | Story Tuesday

Disclaimer: I do own stock in this company.

My Take:

**Westbond Enterprises Corp** has a huge yield of **10.26%.** They made a lot gains over covid with fat government contracts but I believe as they are adding new high margin products to their product line it will continue to grow with good financials. As Covid has made many people become more aware of cleaning and sanitizing I don't think this trend will leave us that soon. There products are also used in hospitals and nursing homes which have all increased there use as sanitizing regulations have been increased. All in all they are a small established company that is making money and I think they will be making more into the future weather Covid is gone this summer or not.

Common blurb:

MONTR√âAL, May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (‚ÄúNouveau Monde‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (TSXV: NOU, OTCQX: NMGRF, FSE: NM9) is pleased to announce that it has received approval for the listing of its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (‚ÄúNYSE‚Äù). The Company expects its common shares will open for trading on the NYSE on May 24, 2021, under the symbol ‚ÄúNMG‚Äù.

***Arne H Frandsen, Chairman of Nouveau Monde, commented:*** ‚ÄúAn extraordinary journey has just achieved another milestone. As Chairman, I am so proud of the Nouveau Monde team, and how we have so promptly secured a listing on the world‚Äôs largest and most important capital market, namely the New York Stock Exchange. This comes as we have commenced the work on our Phase 1 beneficiation plant, which early in 2022 is expected to start producing battery grade shaped, purified and coated graphite. We remain committed to becoming North America‚Äôs largest fully integrated anode material production facility, and ultimately delivering our critical materials with zero carbon footprint from our Qu√©bec-based facilities.*‚Äù*

***Eric Desaulniers, President and CEO of Nouveau Monde, added:*** ‚ÄúAs the Western World‚Äôs economy is on the verge of a major industrial shift driven by the electrification of transportation and energy storage systems, the entire Nouveau Monde team is thrilled to play a meaningful role in the sustainable extraction and transformation of an essential battery material to help make this revolution possible. Nouveau Monde is a true North American story of local security of supply, full traceable verticalization, carbon-neutrality, lot-by-lot consistency and long-term cost structure resilience. We are striving to advance, one milestone at a time, towards our objective of establishing our company as a leading supplier of battery material.‚Äù

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Additional Information for Shareholders**

In addition to listing and trading on the NYSE in U.S. dollars, Nouveau Monde‚Äôs common shares continue to be listed and trade on the TSX Venture Exchange (‚ÄúTSXV‚Äù) in Canadian dollars under the symbol ‚ÄúNOU‚Äù. Shareholders that purchased their Nouveau Monde common shares on the TSXV and, in connection with the NYSE listing, wish to trade in U.S. dollars are advised to contact their broker for more information.

Shareholders that purchased their Nouveau Monde common shares ‚Äúover-the-counter‚Äù or OTC, including shareholders whose shares are denoted in their institution/broker account with the symbol ‚ÄúNMGRF‚Äù, are advised to monitor their account to ensure their holdings are updated to reflect the NYSE listing and trading symbol, as the Company expects OTC quotations for Nouveau Monde common shares to cease in connection with the NYSE listing. Shareholders are advised to contact their broker for more information if they have questions in this regard.

Nouveau Monde‚Äôs common shares will also continue to trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol ‚ÄúNM9‚Äù.

Full Disclosure: I am LONG this company.

I‚Äôve been following this company since they completed a RTO back in December. They‚Äôve got backing from the Canadian gov‚Äôt to help develop their green technology. They are currently using their IP to create fully compostable coffee pods in both Keurig and Nespresso formats. They also plan to use this technology in other applications (they‚Äôve mentioned yogurt cups and face masks publicly). Their stock has been hammered lately but I believe they are poised for a huge rebound over the next 6-12 months. Their latest MD&A on SEDAR mentions that they should receive all of their manufacturing equipment/certifications in June and should be able to start receiving supply orders in Q3 and Q4. This implies significant revenues and partnerships with national brands could be on the horizon.

The company refuses to publish audited financials, Pawson has a past littered with suits and fraud. The WeShield acquisition cannot be verified without further information from OPTI. WeShield corporate address is an apartment in NY. I get working from home, but ‚Äúa company with 50 million‚Äù in audited revenue almost never operate out of an apartment . Possible but unlikely. Their phone number also doesn‚Äôt even have a corporate voicemail. Again, what 50 million dollar company doesn‚Äôt have a VM. Pawson recently applied to increase the authorized shares by 1billion and would see his share increase as well. The increase in AS can be found on Wyoming chamber of commerce website where OPTI is incorporated. 
I know OPTI says they have a 2 billion dollar contract, that is part of a larger 200 billion dollar deal but again has failed to disclose which company this is with. It should also be noted that basically NO private company can order a 200 billion dollar contract. It has to be government money.

If you are in control of a ticker, through the custodianship process, you can reverse merge that company with a company that wants in on the OTC market without the time/expense of an initial listing. Holding companies are picking targets & applying for custodianship on almost a weekly basis right now to grab what they can before the purge so they have tickers to sell to potential reverse merger candidates in the near future.",,

I can tell you, every single stock i did this with, came back in a big way and I missed out bc I was too impatient.

UONE is currently at $6, today it made a 12-13% move, and there was triple the normal volume which I believe was people loading up for June 19. Last June 19 (JUNETEENTH) the stock went from $1 to $54 FYI. UONE upcoming catalysts, this applies to other BLM stocks like BYFC and CARV as well!

1. **1 Year Anniversary of George Floyd's death on May 25th.** High chances this could give UONE a good boost and help solidify anyones entry in the stock right now.
2. **Richmond Casino news late May, early June**.. UONE is up against one other competitor, 50/50 chance they win the casino. This will open the nation's only Black-owned casino!!
3. **Tulsa Massacre on June 1** The Tulsa race massacre took place on May 31 and June 1, 1921, when mobs of white residents, many of them deputized and given weapons by city officials, attacked Black residents and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Ok
4. **Juneteenth (June 19 Holiday)** Last Juneteenth, this caused UONE to reach a high of $54.... it is currently sitting at $5 and we are a little bit over one month away!

Best Plays for Juneteenth: UONE, BYFC, UONEK, CARV, DGLY",ngkx5t,UONE EASIEST 100-500% PLAY (not joking)

OR

If your broker was shitty then they sold your ""extra"" shares and it went into your available funds. What's even worse is that if they did cash you out, they pocketed the extra money themselves from High Tide rounding everyone up that YOU were supposed to get.

Example: Let's say I had 23 shares worth $1 each (for ease of explanation purposes, I know that wasn't the price). Your shares were SUPPOSED to round up to 30 shares because you met the half way mark ( 23/15 = 1.5333) but instead, your shitty brokerage sold those 8 ""extra shares"" for you, gave you one share for your 15 from the reverse split, and then THEY POCKETED THE OTHER 7 SHARES FROM THE ROUNDING UP THEMSELVES.

It only amounts to a maximum of $4 that the brokerages gained per account that was invested in HITI but still. If you have 1 million investors then they just (potentially) got up to $4million for free",,
528,gyrir31,2021-05-20 00:23:23,t1_gyrir31,t3_ngfnfd,pennystocks,"I'll preface this by saying orders are of course on a millisecond level, and even if two orders hit the exchanges front facing infrastructure at the exact same time, latency could be added as an order is processed through systems to cause a distinction.

Their are different algorithms used for prioritising and processing orders, but on a technical level, I think its important to understand that due the vast amount of orders flowing in (and to provide scalability), orders will often be placed in a message/service broker based system, were they can be ""queued"" before a worker process can take the task off the queue and perform the desired actions. These queues are linear and not parallel usually (acting as funnel) so the message broker system would place two order coming in at the same time as a random order for simple fulfilment. It will then be down to the algorithm implemented by workers.

The two algorithms are FIFO (First In, First Out) or Pro-rata algorithm.   
In FIFO, orders are processed entirely on the back end time stamp for processing, so if two orders where to come in (regardless of their size), the first item to be added in to the queue (Randomly remember) will be processed first.

Pro-rata on the other hand uses order size as another variable to decide how to process an order. So in the event two orders come in at the same size, the largest order size is used. This method is more commonly implemented as in a order matching process (Between buyers or sellers), this process is much more scalable and applicable to varying order flows.",,

If a stock can pop simply based on being a sympathy play with another stock named after a body part that had legitimate news, why is light image social focus on race on certain days not a legitimate catalyst to move a black owned business?

[Link to direct press release](https://ir.hertz.com/2021-05-12-Hertz-Selects-6-Billion-Bid-From-Knighthead,-Certares-And-Apollo-To-Fund-Chapter-11-Exit).

From [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/hertz-picks-knighthead-certares-offer-in-bankruptcy-auction):

> In a deal that hands a huge victory to shareholders of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the car renter picked Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management to buy the company out of Chapter 11, capping a dramatic brawl for control of the company.
> 
> The deal, which gives a reorganized Hertz an enterprise value of $7.43 billion, was picked over an offer from a competing group led by Centerbridge Partners, Warburg Pincus and Dundon Capital Partners, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasn‚Äôt been made public. The Knighthead-Certares plan would give equity holders a recovery of about $8 a share -- a package that‚Äôs made up of about $240 million in cash and warrants for nearly 20% of the reorganized company, the people said.
> 
> Hertz shares -- which up until two months ago were faced with the prospects of being completely wiped out under an earlier plan -- soared as much as 41% Wednesday to as high as $5.19. That approached a high of $6.25 last June, when traders snapping up penny stocks on the popular Robinhood app sought to defy decades of convention and make money on a bankrupt company.
> 
> Representatives for Knighthead, Certares and Warburg Pincus declined to comment, while Hertz, Dundon and Centerbridge didn‚Äôt immediately provide comment.
> 
> 
> Hertz shares soar above $4 on bankruptcy exit plans
> The Knighthead-Certares group‚Äôs win brings the pandemic‚Äôs biggest Chapter 11 case nearer to a close, with Hertz seeking to exit court protection in June. Judge Mary Walrath must approve the final plan in Delaware bankruptcy court.
> 
> Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertz‚Äôs equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.
> 
> As part of the winning plan, Apollo Global Management has committed $1.5 billion of preferred equity. Investors also would have the option to participate in a $1.6 billion rights offering.
> 
> The competition came amid surging demand for rentals and summer travel that has let many car renters raise prices while still leaving them without enough vehicles for customers to drive off the lot. Rival Avis Budget Group Inc. has seen its shares more than double this year.
> 
> Final proposals from both groups offered lenders and bondholders full repayment along with the share recovery, a relative rarity in bankruptcy proceedings. Hertz initially chose an iteration of the Centerbridge group‚Äôs plan, and Walrath last month approved a so-called breakup fee for those funds if they were later outbid.
> 
> Hertz sought bankruptcy protection in May 2020 when the near-total shutdown of the global travel industry sent its rental revenues plunging. Equity holders initially appeared to be wiped out, while junior bondholders were slated to take a haircut. Still, Hertz became a popular stock among day traders, who sent shares rocketing on optimism that they could defy the norms of bankruptcy court and win a payout. The stock frenzy even briefly helped the company fund its bankruptcy by selling new equity.

# A. Preamble

$ONCT is one of the most underslept stocks in the biotech yet alone larger investing community, no question. Considering its solid clinical results and upcoming catalysts (literally in a few weeks), I don't see why it isn't getting the recognition it deserves.

ONCT is an early stage biotech specializing in targeting ROR1 expressing cancers. While cancer has always been a hot topic in this industry, ONCT is one of the *few* companies addressing it through the lens of ROR1. I'll explain more about ROR1 below but this isn't your run of the mill gene, protein, or whatever that other pharma companies are focusing on. VelosBio, another company focused on ROR1 cancers was acquired by Merck in 2020 for $2.8B ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc)). The same for NBE-Therapeutics for $1.5B in 2020 by Boehringer Ingelheim ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race)) . Looks like huge players in pharma are interested in ROR1 for some reason, and lucky for us, ONCT does *exactly* that.

# B. Cirmtuzumab for MCL and CLL (Blood Cancer)

https://preview.redd.it/jrh5iqzd67071.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad45ccd1668a57f107eaf0aeaf6c00bc786acda

A lot of things destroy cancer but those same things can also destroy our own healthy cells. **Cirmutzumab** is a potential first in class monoclonal antibody developed by ONCT and targets the ROR1 protein on the surface of cancer cells. ROR1 activity is associated with very **aggressive** symptoms ranging from metastasis to treatment resistance. Lucky for us, ROR1 is *highly* specific to a wide range of different cancers as seen in the figure below and is the very thing cirmtuzumab targets.

**Figure 1**. ROR1 Expression Across Different Tumors

https://preview.redd.it/v441lbhf67071.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6e88427942443aea09ac3e48d5faf1e073de34

As seen in Figure 1, indications of interest are Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which express ROR1 at extremely high levels. These are B-cell malignancies or hematologic cancers. Alright enough with the fluffy intros, **what does the data say?**

**Figure 2.** CIRLL Phase ¬Ω Trial Data for MCL and CLL

https://preview.redd.it/ow3vwqhg67071.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=665da36941ac844fa3247b756381ade612d94fb1

In a treatment design combining cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib, another treatment for hematologic malignancies, the **objective response rate** for MCL was **87%** and **92%** for CLL (Figure 2). So why was cirmtu incorporated with ibrutinib to begin with? Unfortunately, a large number of older patients develop resistance to ibrutinib and hematological disease like MCL can be extremely aggressive with a low 5-year survival rate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/)). The combination not only exceeded the efficacy of standalone ibrutinib therapy for MCL with a historical ORR of around 65% but also did so in high-risk populations that were **heavily pre-treated with other therapies**. The data is non-negotiable (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. Overview of Results in Sub-Populations. CR stands for complete response while PR stands for partial response.

https://preview.redd.it/6duwxg9h67071.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28331fe2273759d751b460cb710b582f0855c0b

Like I said before, a lot of things can attack cancer albeit at the expense of our own cells. Safety is all the more important for cancer and older patients with potentially compromised immune function. There were **0 discontinuations or dose limiting toxicities from cirmtuzumab**. So we potentially have a promising new therapy that targets a range of cancers effectively while minimizing treatment side-effects. Sounds like a solid win to me.

As a side note, ONCT recently expanded their indications to other cancers such as breast cancer. In a trial conducted in UC San Diego, patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer were treated with cirmtuzumab + paclitaxel. This is an **extremely aggressive form of breast cancer** with patients receiving a **median of 6 prior therapies**. The study reported an objective response rate of around 57% which beats the historical rate at around 30% for this subgroup of patients. I will admit, the share price took a hit after this announcement. I venture to say this was a combination of people selling the news and people feeling discouraged with the seemingly low response rate of 57% without realizing that these patients were being treated for **aggressive and treatment resistance breast cancer**.

ONCT is also in dialogue with the **FDA for a potential accelerated approval study for MCL.** Now, clinical trials can last years so will we have patent protection once this therapy is approved? Yup, **patent protection extending all the way to 2033**.

# C. TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/pxd7rhai67071.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa1075705c3a7ab94fac97e2dfc3ca4cfae0105

To pivot, ONCT is also developing a treatment called **TK216** for Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a very rare pediatric cancer and the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. The current standard of care is absolutely abysmal and is based on chemotherapy and invasive surgical procedures. I seriously can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for this disease.

TK216 targets a family of proteins called ETS factors that are directly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and other cancers. So what does the data say about TK216? Well, in a phase ¬Ω trial conducted on patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and who received on average **4 prior therapies**, TK216 accomplished a **9% complete response rate** and **43% disease control rate**. Looks crappy right? Until you dig around and look at the response rates of approved therapies for this disease, you won't realize how **phenomenal** these results are. The FDA seems to agree and has assigned TK216 with an **orphan drug designation for Ewing Sarcoma**.

**Figure 4**. TK216 Clinical Response Rate in Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma

# D. *** Upcoming Catalysts

Here's a brief overview on the expected milestones and timeline

https://preview.redd.it/946b3zik67071.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=f353cf54506b071c6bb20e24598f58d298312d44

**Most importantly** **and the reason why I'm writing this post right now**, ONCT will be presenting its most updated results for cirmtuzumab on MCL and CLL patients and TK216 on Ewing sarcoma in the **2021 ASCO Conference on June 4th and 7th**. This is **highly anticipated data** in what is the world's leading cancer conference, and I expect a huge run up to the conference. Just for reference, ONCT experienced a 78.1% surge in price after releasing an update on its phase ¬Ω trial for cirmtuzumab back in November of 2020. Moreover, the embargoed abstracts for these results were released **today**.

# E. May 19th Data Updates

On May 19th, ONCT released its embargoed abstracts containing the most recent updates concerning cirmtuzumab and TK216. I'd encourage you to look into the updated data yourself:

1. Cirmtuzumab ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab)).
2. TK216 ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216)).

While the details of each trial will be discussed at the conference, I want to mention some key results.

**Cirmtuzumab for MCL May 19th Update**:

1. Objective response rate of **83%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with MCL, beating the historical ORR of 66%.**
2. Complete response rate of **39% for MCL, beating the historical CR rate of 20%.**
3. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
4. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**Cirmtuzumab for CLL May 19th Update:**

1. Objective response rate of **94%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with CLL.**
2. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
3. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma May 19th Update:**

1. **2 patients with complete response** with a follow up of over 1 year each.
2. Stable disease reached for **35.5%** of patients.
3. Updated safety profile showing that TK216 was well-tolerated with no unexpected off-target toxicities or deaths.
4. Patients had **metastases at study entry and heavily pre-treated with a median # of 3 prior systemic therapies**

I wanted to spend more time writing a thorough DD highlighting additional factors such as the management team, details on market potential, expansion into CAR-T therapy, etc. but I wanted to at least post something up before the expected run up to the ASCO conference. If you are interested, I will be happy to write a part II and follow up to this post.

TLDR

1. Promising data on hematological cancers and Ewing sarcoma to be released in **June 4th and 7th,** making this a possible short-term play. Historically, large surges in price with each data release.
2. Embargoed abstracts for #1 released today with excellent data.",ngpzbi,$ONCT: Highly Undervalued With Upcoming Catalysts

You have a bit more freedom on Schwab and TDA although Schwab has some limits and both were soon not going to be allowing CE stocks.

In the end this is going to both help and hurt retail investors.

1. Protects idiots from themselves as they won't be able to buy into as many scams due to limiting how risky or speculative a stock they can invest in.

2. Prevents many retail traders from getting into companies so early, meaning they will potentially get screwed over by institutional or larger investors who can and then sell into the retail when a company finally does go pink current.

Likewise, it's probably going to both hurt and help the OTC market.

1. Forces companies to get their shit together if they want enough retail investment to grow meaning the cream will rise to the top theoretically and better quality companies will be more noticeable.

2. Limits the potential for one of the big reasons many play the OTC markets in the first place... finding hidden gems early.",,

657,,2021-05-20 04:07:25,t3_ngqajk,,pennystocks,"Here is a common scenario I see happen everyday on Fintwits:

1. Person or group, I‚Äôm just going to call them Person A, has a large following on Fintwits, let‚Äôs say >100K. 
2. Person A *KNOWS* based on history that because they have a large following, whatever stock they callout will immediately see a jump in price.
3. Person A‚Äôs following KNOWS based on history that because Person A has a large following, whatever stock Person A calls out will immediately see a jump in price.
4. Person A notices the opportunity here and takes full advantage, buying massive blocks of shares right before they callout the stock to their following.
5. Person A calls out XYZ stock.
6. Person A‚Äôs following buys XYZ stock.
7. XYZ‚Äôs stock price jumps 10%.
8. Meanwhile, Person A is slowly scaling out of their trade in XYZ stock, selling their shares into the liquidity their following is generating.
9. Person A is now out of XYZ stock, making a clean exit.

9.5 If Person A's followers get out green, Person A will respond with, ""Nice job on XYZ stock, everyone!"", ""Let's break this next level!"", etc. If Person A's followers get out red, Person A will respond with, ""We'll make it back on the next one"", ""It's not my fault because I can't force you to buy?"", etc., etc.

10. The price of stock XYZ will now either A) continue to go up, B) stall out, or C) trigger a halt to the downside-- with C) happening more often than A) or B).

11. The price of XYZ stock is now marginally above, at, or below the price it started at prior to Person A's callout.

12. Person A makes another callout on CCC stock.

13. Person A‚Äôs following notices this and is left with three options: A) baghold XYZ stock, B) wait to see if Person A loops back to XYZ stock, anticipating Person A will continue to support XYZ stock, or C) cut their loss, regardless of how big or small, and hope to make money on Person A‚Äôs next callout on CCC stock.

14. Person A gets hailed as being a great trader.

15. On the other side of Fintwits, Person A also gets called out for frontloading pumps. Person A responds to these claims stating he isn't P&Ding because they aren't forcing anyone to follow their trades.

***Who is at fault here? Person A or Person A's followers?***

**The most common responses I get from those who believe it's the** ***followers*** **of Person A's fault normally follow the logic of:**

* ""Person A didn't hit the buy button on their keyboard. No one forced them to buy.""
* ""Trade at your own risk. Those who lost money deserved to lose because they picked a bad entry.""
* ""Person A isn't misinforming their following on XYZ stock, and therefore, can't intentionally mislead them which is the basis of a pump and dump.""
* ""Person A forms a symbiotic relationship. We make money with Person A. Person A wouldn't dump on us.""

**The most common responses I get from those who believe it's** \*\*\*Person A'\*\*\***s fault normally follow the logic of:**

* ""Person A knows what they're doing. They know they can make the price of XYZ stock jump 10% when they make the callout. Because Person A knows this and take advantage of this by frontloading, Person A is, therefore, pumping the stock for their own gain.""
* ""Person A causes more harm than good. When they make their callout, Person A is creating thousands of panic buyers where many will soon become panic sellers. Person A's followers injure XYZ stock by panic selling via lowering the bid v ask when they market sell, leaving XYZ stock lower than it was prior to Person A's callout.""

I honestly couldn‚Äôt find a lot of the science behind Zofin on Organicell‚Äôs website. But that‚Äôs okay. Their main achievement is basically a proprietary way of isolating certain stem cell excretions. 

Here is some science that shows how those types of products could be valuable.

I‚Äôd recommend reading the full article for anyone with a scientific background or an interest in biochemistry.

Here are the points I think are relevant to Organicell and COVID.

[these brackets are my additions and interpretations, basically a less scientific wording forgive me if I got anything wrong]


-The use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as cell free therapy is a promising approach to stimulate tissue regeneration including that of the nervous system.

-The immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal stem cells-derived EVs have been well studied, knowledge of this paracrine mechanism and the availability of these cells, positions mesenchymal stem cells as a potential source of EVs for cell free therapy for a variety of regenerative and nervous system disorders.

[they help modulate the immune system which basically means keep it balanced and working]

-Confirmation of the paracrine effects of stem cells and the relevance to tissue regeneration was a breakthrough in this area, paving the way for a series of subsequent studies to characterize and leverage this mechanism for therapeutic development.

[Paracrine signaling is a form of cell signaling, a type of cellular communication in which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behaviour of those cells. (Wikipedia) - that means that the chemical signals from the harvested cells will be in Zofin and affect positive changes to the patients cells]

-Gnecchi et al. were the first to show that conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing the gene Akt1 exerted cytoprotective effects on cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia in vitro, reduced acute myocardial infarction sizes and improved ventricular functions in vivo

[technology similar to Zofin was proven to protect heart tissue which was starved of oxygen in a living model, and improved heart chamber function as well] 

-MSCs-derived conditional medium was reported to stimulate functional and morphological improvement in pathological conditions such as renal injury, myocardial infarction, and fulminant hepatic failure 

[technology similar to Zofin was proven to improve sick kidneys, help heart attack recovery and reverse liver failure]

-...It was subsequently established that these beneficial [effects] were attributable to soluble factors including extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from stem cells (Bruno et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2010; Xin et al., 2013a). The biogenesis and methodology of isolation of EVs has been described in several published reviews (Biancone et al., 2012; Akers et al., 2013; Koniusz et al., 2016).

[the beneficial effects were attributed to essentially ‚Äústuff the stem cells excreted‚Äù as opposed to the stem cells themselves, which is also what‚Äôs in Zofin]

-The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of MSC-derived EVs and their paracrine mechanism of action have been well studied (Kalani et al., 2014; B√∂rger et al., 2017).

[the chemical signals the stem cells send to other cells is the reason the cellular therapy worked to prevent inflammation and protect brain function. Those chemical messengers are in Zofin]

-EVs have been shown to be actively involved in processes of immune regulation such as stimulation of T-cell proliferation, apoptosis induction in activated cytotoxic T-cells, differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells and B lymphocyte-mediated tumor suppression (Bobrie et al., 2011; Chaput and Th√©ry, 2011; Taylor and Gercel-Taylor, 2011). 

[EVs which are also in Zofin stimulate growth of T-cells (the cells your body uses to fight viruses etc), cause bad cells to die by making the immune system basically break them down...all sounds really good]

-The immunomodulatory properties of MSCs-derived EVs are reported to be the result of the suppression of TNF-a and IL-1b secretion, increasing the concentrations of TGF-b, regulatory T cells (Treg) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4, inducing Th1 to Th2 cell conversion, reducing IFN-Œ≥ production and the potential of T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells (Mokarizadeh et al., 2012; Blazquez et al., 2014; Del Fattore et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016b). 

[this explains how similar therapies help modulate the immune system, I think the important part is it increases formation of certain T-cells and also stops the T-cells being formed from turning into types of T-cells that cause inflammation, inflammation is a huge problem in COVID]

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for‚Äîand value of‚Äîcertain ‚Äúover-the-counter (OTC) securities‚Äù you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E\*TRADE from making these products generally available.  
  
Some background on the new requirements  
  
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements.  
  
Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected.  
  
What these changes mean for you  
  
Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities through E\*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities you hold now or in the future.  
  
Here‚Äôs how to get more information about these changes and how they might affect you:  
	  
	Understand the SEC amendments for OTC securities  
	Learn more about quotations for OTC securities

I don't blame someone for buying before tweeting - especially someone with a large following. To do otherwise would be dumb and make me wonder why they're not prioritizing their trades over their tweets. So that being said, if someone with thousands of followers tweets that they are accumulating, it comes off as disingenuous.

I imagine a lot of these guys are good momentum traders, and that's how they get the followers in the first place. Maybe it's an double edged sword, where they'd be foolish not to adapt once they see a pattern developing of price bumps after their posts. What grinds my gears is when they post really dumb DD. Part of it is DD simply isn't a big factor of their strategy, but I can't help but feel they're often playing dumb and they know whatever catalyst they're pumping is BS. If they never respond to feedback pointing out some of the less glowing aspects of a catalyst, that's a red flag they're being disingenuous.

All said, my favorite Twitter posters are focused more on general advice and information, not calling out entries.  For sheep blindly following someone on Twitter for those entries, I guess they get what they paid for literally and in terms of the effort they're putting in. Not to say the paid services out there don't do the exact same thing.",,

Beyond that, I believe all brokers are going to stop selling OTC stocks that don't get current by the September deadline. That will include many more OTC's than just the CE ones.

943,,2021-05-20 13:34:27,t3_nh0dag,,pennystocks,"I'm surprised this subreddit isn't BUZZING about $QNTA has in the coming months! Here's my summary of why $QNTA has HUGE potential.


Medolife Rx, Inc. (""Medolife"") is a global integrated bioceutical company with R&D, manufacturing, and consumer product distribution, which is a majority owned subsidiary of Quanta, Inc. (OTC PINK: QNTA). They are in the process of getting their diluted scorpion venom drug, Escozine, approved by the FDA as an Investigational New Drug (IND). Escozine is claimed to have positive impacts on cancer treatments and also reduce the symptoms of COVID-19.


They have been submitting pre-clinical trial data for IND approval to the FDA since at least March. Approval from the FDA would allow them to conduct clinical trials in the US for Escozine.


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-submits-final-data-123000200.html
https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/QNTA/news/story?e&id=1842198


Where Escozine has made the most progress is in the Dominican Republic.


They are opening a scorpion venom extraction facility there to get raw material for their drug. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-announces-extraction-facility-120000538.html


They are planning to conduct double-blind Phase II clinical trials there on human patients. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-completes-initial-meeting-120000454.html


The drug is approved for sale in Latin American countries. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-announces-historic-product-120000114.html


""The Company has compiled large amounts of clinical data validating Escozine‚Äôs ability to not only improve quality of life in cancer patients, but also its potential ability to kill cancer cells, as shown in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies on various forms of cancer that led to this historic registration. Medical professionals in the DR have embraced the use of Escozine¬Æ in cancer treatment regimens for some time now, including one providing a full recommendation on the drug‚Äôs cancer-fighting and quality-of-life improving attributes.""


The main goal/gamble with this stock is, diluted scorpion venom treatments have been seen as purely anecdotal by the medical community. What would be really huge here is if they are able to clinically prove Escozine has positive impacts on treating cancer and COVID-19, among other ailments. 

https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/scorpion-venom

""The claims made for blue scorpion venom marketed to cancer patients as Escozine, Escozul, and Vidatox (a homeopathic version) are mostly based on anecdotes, testimonials, and experiments which may or may not have been properly carried out. In Cuba where these products originated, the government rejected the use of Escozul in 2009 because there was not enough data. The homeopathic version, which uses very dilute solutions of the active ingredient, has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer. The properties of blue scorpion venom are just starting to be described more thoroughly in scientific research. Therefore, like venoms from other scorpion species, blue scorpion venom compounds one day may be isolated and properly developed to create cancer therapies, but much more research is needed.""


tl;dr: $QNTA is trying to clinically and scientifically prove the efficacy of scorpion venom treatments with their drug, Escozine. They are making great progress towards this in the Dominican Republic and the US, and the price action of the stock reflects this short and long term. Something to think about!",nh0dag,$QNTA - the OTC stock that needs to be on your radar

The question is how much of the profit is KAVL and its shareholders going to get from it since the profit will be determined by the expenses that bidi reports to KAVL.  Since the CEO is also CFO I wonder what oversight is there in KAVL to look out for the shareholders.

Does anyone have an explanation of why KAVL even exists (having Bidi just go public itself) and/ or why bidi is NOT merged with the KAVL.    The existence of KAVL makes no sense to me so would appreciate if someone would explain to me.",,
