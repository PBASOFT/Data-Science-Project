Take a look at the statistics of funds versus retail in the market. Retail has grown insanely, and obviously an individual retail trader working with only $1400 isn't gonna move markets, but when you multiply that, a fuck ton of them with $1400 can sure give the large funds more to work with in what they do. 

This has always been happening, but it certainly is happening more and at larger degrees now which without a doubt can be attributed to the growth of small money traders. If you think retail high on hype can't move share prices, you're just wrong. They just can't pull the rug out like large money can, which is why large money always wins.",,

Expectations were great/blowout earnings, when the market delivers, its no surprise to anyone except the rube who sees the headline and decides today would be the perfect day to start a position. Algos/humans will buy large positions on the way up, and sell 50% on the way down, buy back the 50% at the lower half of the range/trend.

As for small caps/micro caps moving like they do.....Crazy shit. I try and stay away from those kind of companies, the floats are so small, and the price is so low, that retail traders/whales can move the stocks quite easily. Just me 0.02

I'd also be curious to how you believe markets should move, they're open 5 days a week just under 8 hours a day, they have to trade, 'fair value' is the real bullshit, if the price traded a few shares a day, sure.

What you dont want to do is hire a ton of people then get stuck with not enough work once things correct. Also this isnt the kind of field where you hire someone and they are instantly productive. There is a lot of training involved so again, better to grow slowly than rapidly.

The backlog on materials is just that. A temporary backlog due to a year of low to no productivity. It will correct by year end. Also futures on materials are not reflective of the spot market. They might be predictive of a trend but thats all. Recall when oil went negative... that was fun and funny but obviously not reflective of the actual market.

My professor for financial economics had us read ""A Random Walk Down Wallstreet"".  There is a lot in the book, but I took out of it something that has seemed to be fairly close to a certainty over the last 20ish years. Actually two truths if you will. 

In an oversimplified way of thinking, there are two types of investors in the stock market.   The are fundamentalists and technicians.

Fundamentalist are more akin to a Warren Buffet.  Invest in things that make sense, with profits you can see.  To these guys earnings are very important.  They are trying to invest in the long term profitability of the company.  What the price does today, or over the next week, or even next year doesn't matter.   If people are buying coke and coke isn't submerged under debt and coke has good leadership, invest in coke.

Technicians have some type of technique they are trying to use to invest.   The most common are ""chartest"" where they look at the price chart for some  pattern that they think repeats throughout the  market, across time and securities.   Think of all the people pointing to charts claiming the big squeeze on GME.

Now the first truth I've learned is that fundamentalist are usually right in the long term.  Healthy, profitable companies don't go out of business.  But in the short term, fundamentals don't matter. Technicians may or may not be right, but if enough people start believing the same thing, then it comes true.  

Here lies the second truth.  The stock market, really all markets, work day to day on Christmas Magic.  If enough people (or bots or institutions or pension funds or whatever) just believe that Santa Clause is real,  that jolly fat ass will come down your chimney.  It's all belief.  Christmas magic won't make Sears become Walmart.   It won't resurrect Toys R Us.  But it can, for one day, make the impossible possible.",,

Even in very large networks with each node acting randomly, but dependent, creates harmonics. Think of a flock of birds going to work in a factory. An example is queue theory where a store goes from being dead one minute to busy the next. In reality simulations tend to have a half life where interference of people to prevent disaster leads the forecast astray.

Where things go wrong is the more aligned the naturally random nodes are, the harder they will break down the system once unity is lost. Its like pushing down further on a spring and building up pressure. The reason for this tends to be a lack of a reservoir to buffer because in order for a reservoir to form there has to be a gap between input and output. Unity means there is equal input & output.

The number one risk of trading bots is they can trip themselves into a crash without anyone understanding why. There really isn't a reason other than system dynamics. The more we rely on bots the more we are susceptible to them crashing the system.",,

Ask any experienced trader what happens when rates go up in the market... typically you see heavy selling action and an alternative switch of money in stocks to bonds/gold/or etc. Right now, you can have a FANG stock for example that can crush earnings and it doesn't mean they are fair game for a institution to not dump.

Today was just a teaser of what's coming. Look up CMBS and how poorly they're situated. Look up net accounts, and what they mean relative to CDOs. Learn about credit swaps and how the repo market works. Research how repo and bond markets are currently positioned. Look into record-breaking bond offerings by banks recently. Ask yourself, why? What event is provoking banks, brokers, and hedge funds to shore up cash liquidity at record levels? What do they know? Follow the money!

Look at recent DTCC, NTSCC, and OCC filings/rule changes. Research what these rules mean and how they apply to major players. Who has a seat at the table? Who does not, but wants one? Learn what those regulatory bodies are and what they do. Why are they changing the rules? Study up on margin calls, and try to forecast which banks, brokerages, and hedge funds may be at risk to be margin called. Why are they at risk? More importantly, which positions are they most overleveraged in? This is important because those short and/or unprofitable positions will be the positions that will be initially ignored (except for extremely underwater puts), upon margin call. Counterintuitively, their profitable, long/call investments will take the most damage during a margin call, because these positions will get liquidated first, to cover margin. Understand how the money works. Who will buy up these fire sales?

Why did crip toe get obliterated across the whole market today? Why do companies with blowout earnings keep dumping? Why is it that the moment the media finally mentioned the inflation, that's been happening for months, it began to slide a bit? Why are incredibly overleveraged U.S. treasuries creeping up? Why is money moving in non-traditional directions? Also, where/whom is it moving from? Where/whom is it moving to? Why?

Research these things and find the answers. Then spend a day and watch The Big Short three times in a row. Then, read over your research from these comments and questions a few times. Finally, spend another day watching The Big Short a few times, research in-hand, and take notes. Read the research again, along with these new notes. It should be blaringly obvious at that point. You should be ""JACKED TO THE TITS,"" if you figure it out. If not, post questions here, and I'll do my best to answer most of them in a timely manner.

Like the top comment said, the day to day stuff is usually market sentiment. It comes in waves. Penny stocks pump and dump occasionally, and it seems like it's penny stock season again. 

If you're looking to make a quick buck on earnings, there is no such thing as DD. NFLX can do outstanding and still dump 10%. TSLA can do horrendous and jump. Why? Doesn't matter. Don't bet on something that relies heavily on an earnings report (e.g weekly calls expiring the same week of earnings). Instead, maybe just read the earnings report and if you think it indicates growth, invest. If not, then don't (or sell if you're already holding a position). After all, companies don't report earnings so options traders can win big or lose big. They have to report to let investors know if theyre worth their money or not.",,

See here's the problem: the damn interest rate. No one pays attention to it because it's not glamorous and the only time it makes the news is when the chairman is about to announce the direction it'll move in. 

We have never had free money circulating in the market this long (by free I mean money that can be borrowed at 0 or near-0 rates). This is also why housing is exploding, and you're not making a dime on your deposits in the bank, but the bank is making a killing loaning out your money. 

When a country needs to borrow money, it sells bonds. I'm Slovenia: I will send you one Slovenian bond and then in 5 years, I'll buy that bond back to you, but in those 5 years, I'll pay you 0.5% interest. 0.5% is nothing. The market is willing to accept that for now because people are front loading on debt, and so are corporations (buy backs, expansion fueled by debt etc.) 

However, there will come a day, and it's coming soon, where the ""market"" will demand a higher interest rate. There's a limited amount of money to lend, and we will reach our lending capacity at some point, particularly with rates being this absurdly low. 

Once the market pushes the rate up, it'll be armageddon. People are quick to say ""This will never happen,"" but we do not have control of that - the market is global. If china wanted to shaft us, they would just bump up what their debt offering is. 

I personally think it will come from the arab world. Oil economies will need lines of capital, and high-interest debt will be a great way to create said lines once the oil wells dry up.",,

Perhaps put another way I think you're both talking past each other.  There's an issue about the quantity of money in the economy, and the actual value of the economy priced by demand.

A few unique ones:

FSI - Small but growing environmental company that makes a chemical that prevents excess water evaporation. PE of 14. I see a trajectory like that of ERII

MLHR - Herman Miller, maker of the Eames chairs. Iconic American brand. Mostly office furniture. But luxury. Also doing furniture for gamers with LOGI. Have maintained revenues but still priced below pre pandemic levels. Great reopening/office play. Just acquired KNL

BLBD - Another iconic American brand. Maker of Blue Bird buses, including electric ones. Already getting orders for them. Revenues down this year, but orders for the next decade will run like a banshee with need for NEW buses.

UGRO - This is another small company. Agroponics. Comparable to AGFY. But tiny market cap, recently uplisted, half market cap is cash on hand, growing and expanding internationally.

AHCO - Medical device company. Very under the radar. Ridiculous growth and acquisitions. Was featured in IBD not long ago

KLR - Very, very under the radar mini TWLO with a price multiple many times lower. Huge potential.

MOGO - A mini Sofi for Canada and international, too, now. Owns chunk of Coinsquare. Very undervalued IMO.",,

I can think of countless times I've owned stocks that crushed earnings fairly consistently, and a few times by 2-3x, only for the price to tank immediately after ER. I've always thought it was partially because there is generally this sentiment that we're ""at the top"" in the market overall, so investors think that things can't go higher, so they're eager to take profits, tank the stock, only to see it slowly recover until the cycle inevitably repeats after next earnings release.",,

System harmonics is like an orchestra where each player can play their own song and adapt at any time. Eventually some natural order forms from the chaos and a symphony is heard. This also happens in factories where there is high dependency and minimal buffers of time. This is actually a bad thing.

Once a symphony is formed it creates a feedback loop that reinforces the symphony. The players in the symphony tend to repeat themselves because what they did before obviously worked. Eventually they stop paying attention and don't worry about reserves.

When one player or node eventually moves out of phase the system tries to maintain harmony while the symphony begins to crash and soon the music stops because nobody knows what's going on rather than each node focusing on their own song. This happens in factories way more than people realize. Its why Toyota as an example works insanely hard to crush variation and enforce rigid supply methods so there is no song, its just a hummmmm.

Algo trading is exactly the same.

Why would you own an asset that never pays you any benefits? The asset's price becomes based on what the next person will pay for the asset, based on the hope for some sort of return ""far into the future"". 

Dividend stocks like T have hovered around the 5-6% yield for the past decade. When they raise dividends due to high earnings, the stock price appreciates to the point where it pays out a 5-6% yield. When investors expect a dividend cut, the price tanks, like T has been doing the past few days. 

The same goes for REIT stocks, which have all consistently maintained a steady dividend payout % based on their risk. 

When you invest in a non-returning asset, you're playing casino to some degree and need to accept that. Even if a hot company grows by 300% every year for 10 years, if it never pays out any dividends or buys back shares, then one day just goes bankrupt and disappears, you've technically earned ZERO from that asset over those 10 years.",,

I'm 33 and have a general question about the recent massive influx of printed money and how that might affect stock prices going forward. Actually unrelated to that, I wonder, what is your opinion on this bull market ending and crashing hard? To the contrary, my mind is thinking that, in theory, isn't every stock undervalued right now due to the recent 4trillion in printed money, or have we seen the market respond accurately to that already?

If not, isn't it a no-brainer to invest in some top stocks in each sector? I'm starting to see prices everywhere start to slowly creep up in everyday life (fast food is insanely expensive now). I hear companies like BOA increasing their minimum hourly wage to $25 by 2025. I see Chipotle, Target and other companies like Amazon paying between 15-17 an hour for basic work.

Again, wouldn't this mean the current prices we're seeing in the stock market are technically ""undervalued"" and not accurate meaning they should all go up significantly in the next year, 2 or 5? Or will we see a sideways or bear market in the coming years?

[SIPC protects against the loss of cash and securities – such as stocks and bonds – held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage firm. The limit of SIPC protection is $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash.](https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects)

That's it. That's the list.

If you want your $1M insured, don't keep more than $250k cash in any bank or brokerage firm, or $500k total in any brokerage firm.

The SIPC has a couple of twists:  money market accounts (sweep accounts) are considered securities, not cash, so you don't have to buy risky instruments to get all 500k protected; and, they don't protect currency, commodities or commodity futures, or warrants on those, but they do protect options on currencies and warrants to buy those options.

[Some sweep accounts actually divide the money among multiple, separate corporate entities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303948104579534061394822726), so your $1M may automatically be split up and set apart enough to be protected.

Rising inflation means rising cost of living. As costs increase consumption (demand) decreases. As demand decreases, sales drop, earnings will follow and valuations will follow. Share prices will follow. Supply will correct and incomes will decrease as jobs are cut.

With respect to your comment regarding we have a shrinking labour pool as boomers are mostly retired (or close enough) and Gen Xers are the new boomers.

Wages are rising because of a supply/demand imbalance. Some may say it's the stimulus keeping people home. Maybe so for some but the macro trend is a shrinking labour force. Prior to Covid stimulus the US had 3.5% unemployment which essentially means anyone who wants to work has a job..... Or 2 since the minimum wage is barely above defined poverty at 2080 hours per year.",,

They have one of the lowest cost primary vanadium mines in the world (if not the lowest) and they make a purer vanadium concentrate than the benchmark, which is useful for some applications. 

The primary application is in steel production. A very small amount of vanadium can double the strength of a given weight of steel. A secondary (up-and-coming) application is in flow batteries, which are promising for long-term stationary energy storage--like that needed to balance renewable supply to the grid. Largo has acquired tech for vanadium flow batteries, and they are in the process of lining up production for these. 

Infrastructure plans being launched by various countries will increase the demand for both steel and storage. (See skyrocketing iron ore prices. Oh--also, Largo has a huge stockpile of low-quality iron ore as a byproduct of its vanadium production. They're trying to sell it, though at a discount to the 62% benchmark, as it's lower quality. But they have like two million tons of it.) Supply is already stretched, and historically the price for vanadium can skyrocket when supply/demand imbalance arises (currently at ~$8/lb, has hit $30 when stretched).
