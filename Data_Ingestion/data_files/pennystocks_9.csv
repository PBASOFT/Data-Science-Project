TORONTO and KNOXVILLE, Tenn., May 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Solar Alliance Energy Inc. (‚ÄòSolar Alliance‚Äô or the ‚ÄòCompany‚Äô) (TSX-V: SOLR)** is pleased to announce it has signed a binding Letter of Intent (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with Abundant Solar Power Inc. (‚ÄúAbundant‚Äù) to build, own and operate a 350 kilowatt (‚ÄúkW‚Äù) solar project in New York State (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù).  


The construction-ready Project is permitted and is supported by a 30 year power purchase agreement. This Project will be the first solar project in the Company‚Äôs portfolio of operating solar assets and will generate a recurring revenue stream over its 30 year life.

‚ÄúThis project in New York State represents a significant catalyst for Solar Alliance and clearly outlines the potential for strong growth we see in our ability to build, own and operate assets in the US market‚Äù said Solar Alliance CEO Myke Clark. ‚ÄúThis project is ready to build and is backed by a 30 year power purchase agreement that will provide a recurring revenue stream to Solar Alliance. Abundant is a respected developer of solar projects and we are confident we can build on our relationship in order to access a larger pipeline of solar projects that we can develop, own and operate.‚Äù

Solar Alliance anticipates signing an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (‚ÄúEPC‚Äù) contract with Abundant. Construction on the Project is expected to commence this summer and is anticipated to be in operation by the end of 2021.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to be working with Solar Alliance on this project and see the potential for an expanded relationship moving forward,‚Äù said Abundant‚Äôs CEO Richard Lu. ‚ÄúAbundant Solar has an extensive pipeline of solar projects in development and we see strong syngergies between our two teams.

The net capital cost for the project is expected to be approximately US$525,000 and will be financed by Solar Alliance either through equity or a combination of debt and equity. As part of the Company‚Äôs expansion strategy, Solar Alliance is also assessing opportunities to acquire or partner on earlier stage develop projects that would eventually be built, owned and operated by the Company. This complements Solar Alliance‚Äôs growing business of designing, engineering and installation solar systems for third party owners.

‚ÄúSolar Alliance has made the strategic decision to pursue growing, near term revenue opportunities in addition to building, owning and operating our own solar projects. This allows us to generate revenue to support our operations while we grow our portfolio of assets under ownership, concluded Clark.

The company issued an offering recently which led its stock to drop from 10$ a share down to about 3$ where it bottomed out.

Since then the daily chart has been curling up, it has been very bearish up until this point. All of the indicators are very extended, bottomed out and converging on bullish. As of three days ago green volume has started coming in more and more. Currently as of Friday sitting at 2x average volume.
AEI has a low float of 6m, and currently receiving higher than average volume as it curls back up. Its sitting at 4.21$ after hours, but on the 30min chart it is very extended and I would expect a pullback to the 4$ mark and hold that as new support. If it hold 4$ there isn't anything stopping it to 6$. Especially if it receives more volume, with a 6m float, this stock could go crazy and I want to be in it if and when it does!

RSI, MACD, and Stochastics and Volume all indicate a nice run up in the very near future and I will absolutely watch to size into a position around the 4$ mark.",niq76u,$AEI - Low Float

at the end of April i bought 4 or 5 shares of XSPA at $1.39 each. to me, it looked like a dip, and i planned on holding it for 2 weeks before i went back and assessed the situation.

at the end of those two weeks, it slid down to $1.11 and it didn't seem like it would stop sliding (the latest news about it at the time didn't sound promising), so i got out.

So yeah you're correct their sparkling juice, Apple Rush, is listed on their applerush site. Used to be on Amazon and Walmart but it stopped being restocked due to a couple of reason. I believe the sparkling juice is still being produced - just not avaiable online.

Instead the brand started shifting focus to their CBD infused water. Element C is the main one, few others in the works:
https://element-brands.com/
Big selling point is they are all natural and acutally tastes good vs other CBD drinks.
This is where the hype is, they've introcuded it a lot of trade shows, distribution is growing all the time (have a look at their twitter https://twitter.com/RealAPRU_NEWS).

**$73 NEAR TERM PRICE TARGET**

Check   out the chart below and you tell me if you can see where this is   headed... There is next to zero resistance all the way back to the   $40-$70s trading range and shorts know it.

The massive pushes to $19 and $12 have wiped out all the previous resistance. It's about ready to explode.

A   shareholder update call has been scheduled for June 3rd at 8:30....   just 5 days prior to the annual shareholder meeting on June 8th.   Something big is coming!

**SHORT INTEREST**

Shorts   continue to double down and they are going to very a hard lesson as  the  average 3 month volume has dried up. Last time it did this it ran  from  $3 to $19 very fast. It's even better this time since there are  over 1  million short-sold shares now and a much larger institutional  ownership  percentage now.

Shorts   continue to pile in even with the upcoming shareholder event on June   3rd just 5 days prior to the annual shareholder meeting.

All the gains I took from this I'm now injecting back into $WSGF as it's come all the way back down to .022 as of writing.

Why? Normal P&D it looks like. For those of you I need remind though Vacaychella was trending on a bullish af chart up to .035 BEFORE the app even launched. Now with this app launch this company has promise of doing big things.

If you have signed up for Vacaychella yourself you most likely would have received an email such as I have that details how insane this has been and they were not ready for how many sign ups they were going to receive. They are doing numbers larger than expected for this app phase and are primed for steady growth here on out in. This is a trillion dollar business may I remind you and they are revolutionizing it which is DIFFICULT TO DO. They have an idea and are pairing with large friends behind them including Booking.com and AirBnB which is already the biggest partners out there. Ideas like this that exist in massive caps like real estate do not come around often.

Now I've been pretty good at sliding in and out of P&D including 3xing TAWNF 2xing ASTI 2xing this and I'm ready to jump back in.

Now the floor for this previous sat at .02 which is a huge indicator for me that I want in considering were at .022. This is also finally a company that is going to be doing something. Everyone that is dumping here isn't seeing how insane this charts recovery can be and I think it is overselling and going to recover strong for a good 10% gain over the next couple days then after we establish some sideways action it'll start steaming up the way it did before.

Are you treating Vacaychella as a 1 night stay? Or are you as big in this as I am and buying back in today for a long time vacation?",nljw9i,$WSGF Vacaychella is a steal right now

Funding from Australian Government, Peer-Reviewed research from University of Queensland, FORBES.COM ARTICLE [https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/05/13/ev-range-breakthrough-as-new-aluminum-ion-battery-charges-60-times-faster-than-lithium-ion/?sh=17fe8676d287](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/05/13/ev-range-breakthrough-as-new-aluminum-ion-battery-charges-60-times-faster-than-lithium-ion/?sh=17fe8676d287)

Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) is an Australian based company that specializes in the production and sale of graphene enhanced products. Traditionally cost prohibitive and difficult to produce high quality Graphene, GMG‚Äôs proprietary production method using Natural Gas (Methane) instead of Graphite allows for high quality, inexpensive graphene to be produced.  This allows GMG to pivot towards fast-charging Aluminum-Ion battery prototyping/production as their primary products.

&#x200B;

ALUMINUM-ION BATTERIES AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Aluminum-Ion Batteries are a newer type of battery currently being researched and tested by a number of organizations, including University of Queensland (UQ) and Stanford University, and have shown increasing promise as an alternative to Lithium-ion batteries. The additional benefit of using little-to-no heavy metals (i.e. Lithium, Cobalt, etc.) makes this a super attractive formulation.

One of the limiting factors has been the graphite/graphene (depending on prototype tested) used in the battery. While I‚Äôm not going to deep dive into the ins and outs of graphene production, traditional methods producing graphene from Graphite are expensive and difficult to obtain a high-quality plane structure. This is where GMG comes in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The University of Queensland, in their Aussie government funded research into Aluminum-Ion batteries, went with GMG to supply their graphene and found they were able to achieve fantastic results. GMG‚Äôs high quality graphene plane structure produced from natural gas instead of graphite allowed for a breakthrough in the amount of aluminum atoms that could be ‚Äúinserted‚Äù inside of the graphene planes (layers) to produce high density electrodes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

THE RESULT OF THIS?

A high-density battery that acts practically like a super capacitor. **Charges times up to 60x-70x faster and capacity comparable to traditional lithium-ion batteries WITHOUT EXHIBITING HEAT ISSUES THAT WOULD CAUSE A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY TO EXPLODE TRYING TO CHARGE THIS FAST**. Numbers like these might sound too good to be true, but this is peer reviewed research by the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland. And Graphene Manufacturing Group has exclusive access to this battery formulation through their research and commercialization agreement with the University of Queensland and Uniquest (UQ's commercialization company) because they supplied the Graphene free of charge.

&#x200B;

ENERGY DENSITY

Below is a chart of the current Aluminum-Ion technologies being tested.

[\*Lithium Ion: Energy Density \~100-265 Wh\/kg, Power Density \~250 ‚Äì 340 W\/kg  \(Source: See links at end of page\)\*](https://preview.redd.it/sbsaun2ddh171.jpg?width=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23d77989abc17d4d72c87ea88c697acfd37078e1)

&#x200B;

>‚ÄùGMG Managing Director Craig Nicol insisted that while his company‚Äôs cells were not the only graphene aluminum-ion cells under development, they were easily the strongest, most reliable and fastest charging.  
>  
>‚ÄúIt charges so fast it‚Äôs basically a super capacitor,‚Äù Nicol claimed. ‚ÄúIt charges a coin cell in less than 10 seconds.‚Äù

&#x200B;

MULTIPLE OBVIOUS USES FOR BATTERIES LIKE THIS

* Cars ‚Äì Fully charge a car in 10-20 minutes
* Cell phones ‚Äì Fully charge a cell phone in 1-5 minutes
* Laptops
* Coin Cells (watch batteries) ‚Äì Fully charge in 10 seconds
* Powerwalls
* etc

&#x200B;

PROS

* Much faster charge times
* Little to no Heat buildup
   * Safer charging and at faster rates
   * Weight reduction in batteries (less cooling and thermal management circuitry)
* Reduce dependence on China for rare earth heavy metals
* Materials are highly recyclable and easy to obtain
* Cycle lifespan up to 3x longer than traditional Li-ion
* Can fit into same housings and operate at the same voltages as Li-Ion

&#x200B;

>‚ÄúSo far there are no temperature problems. Twenty percent of a lithium-ion battery pack (in a vehicle) is to do with cooling them. There is a very high chance that we won‚Äôt need that cooling or heating at all,‚Äù Nicol claimed. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt need circuits for cooling or heating, which currently accounts for about 80kg in a 100kWh pack.‚Äù

&#x200B;

CONS AND OTHER NOTABLES

I will always be the first one to talk about potential caveats and downsides:

* Graphene is traditionally expensive - GMG‚Äôs method claims that it is much cheaper to produce than traditional methods, but final figures are still yet to be known.  Current prices from other producers are around $100/gram, but this figure is for typical graphene production methods using mined graphite. GMG has plans to ramp up production so pricing models are yet to be known. I was unable to find how much graphene is required per kg of battery, likely proprietary info right now.
* Infrastructure ‚Äì If charge times truly are this fast, our electric grid simply cannot handle large batteries charging this quickly.
   * However there are proposed workarounds for this. For example, I have seen suggestions of charging an Aluminum-ion powerwall to full capacity at a slower rate and then using said powerwall to fast-charge an EV separate from the grid.
* This is still in early prototyping right now but the research and production methods are sound. GMG is a smaller company and it will take time to ramp up graphene production and develop new products.

&#x200B;

GMG‚ÄôS PLAN MOVING FORWARD

Graphene Manufacturing Group currently has research and commercialization agreements with the University of Queensland and Uniquest and has begun the prototyping stage:

>‚ÄúUnder the agreement, GMG will manufacture commercial battery prototypes for watches, phones, laptops, electric vehicles and grid storage with technology developed at the University of Queensland (‚ÄúUQ‚Äù). GMG has also signed a license agreement with Uniquest, the University of Queensland's commercialization company, which provides GMG exclusive license of the technology for battery cathodes.‚Äù

Currently, their revenue is pretty small from their traditional graphene products they sell, but they have made it clear that they are pivoting to batteries this year. GMG is starting with coin cell batteries by the end of 2021 and are aiming to work their way up to automotive style batteries estimated around 2024. Currently they hope to run with the technology and vertically integrate it themselves instead of licensing the technology. However, they have stated this is not set in stone and potential partnerships with phone / automotive companies could be an option.

GMG recently went public and trades as $GMG.V / $GMGMF

**May 2021 CEO presentation**

[https://youtu.be/pDkDQ3oDSkE](https://youtu.be/pDkDQ3oDSkE)

Warning - new CEO sucks a bit as a salesman, Just be patient till he warms up. This is a very smart technical guy with clear strategic vision: exploring training market, making smaller more affordable home versions. This is great!

Particularly, the agreement with CoolerMaster (Taiwanese CPU cooler manufacturer. Check out their products...) to produce gaming equipment, and AudioKinetic (which controls 65% gaming audio market) agreement for game developers to be able to produce D-BOX haptic content. This is the right direction - game & movie people should have access to this. Remember before Apple start to be winning market share? They had to get APP developers (tools, conferences, etc) first.

This is a smart CEO talking about top notch strategy. Now it's a matter of execution. Go D-BOX!

**And the rest**

Full disclosure: I bought a sizable amount of DBO shares recently (Feb 2021). Prior to the investment, I was looking around for information about its business, but all I could find was the financial statement (up to Dec 2020, their financial Q3) and some high level description with logs of graphics on its ‚Äúabout us‚Äù page. From these, I didn‚Äôt find much positive information about its outlook:

**Leadership changes**

S√©bastien Mailhot as the new President and CEO since Apr 1, 2020. In Feb, there were two new appointments to the Board of Directors.

**Some Financials**

The company was on a good trajectory at end of 2019. Pandemic changed a lot of things since.

4.8 mln in cash at end of 2020, burning at \~3.7 mln per year (2020). It did secure a 4mln loan from National Bank in 2020 and used it to repay long term debt immediately.

Compared to 2019 (19mln), the 2020 9 month revenue number (8.1 mln) isn‚Äôt that bad, all things considered.

On Feb 17, company announced overnight marketed equity offering at C$0.13. Even the over-allotment was fully exercised. Company raised C$5.75 mln.

**Product**

Its biggest revenue comes from the ‚Äútheatre seats that move‚Äù. Depending on the film, feedbacks are mixed. There are a lot of theatres (720 screens in 40 countries) with D-BOX seats. On May 26 Cinemark signed deal to get 8 additional screens equipped (total 99). DBOX gets a cut from the ticket sales.

Its commercial entertainment & simulation products enjoy favorable comments from multiple gaming product reviewers and are considered the go-to for the best seats and cockpits for game/racing simulation. There‚Äôs no problem with performance of their products ‚Äì they rock. Price point is quite high and not a lot of people have the space and budget for one.

The announcement in Sep 2020 of partnership with Jaymar to produce D-BOX seats for the home. This ‚Äúhome‚Äù version is definitely the right direction to get into living rooms. A $3699 US price tag is not a cheap one, but much easier to consider than their pricy race simulation products.

**Thoughts**

Countries will be coming out of pandemic and resuming activities within a few more quarters. People will look for experiences that they have been deprived of. A good immersive experience at theatres, or a similar experience at home are going to make some good money. D-BOX is in a position to benefit from both.",nlmavr,"D-BOX $DBO.TO (ASK @ C$0.105): a mini DD, no DCF"

260,,2021-05-26 17:33:45,t3_nlmn2v,,pennystocks,"Hey guys - back with some DD on a new company (thanks to some players on the CSE forum) I've been following for the past few months - **BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO ($CRFT).** The company was previously Pasha Brands, which was a trash pump and dump designed for an acquisition in 2019 (which fell through), and now they're rebuilding with some pretty amazing assets in hand. Take a look. **Full disclosure: I bought $5200 at 3.5c and 4c because I think it's going to rip. Already up 12.5% today.**

**SUMMARY:**

There have been a bunch of companies that were raided by corporate pirates and robbed of the opportunity to win in the Canadian cannabis market in 2018/2019. We know the story - corporate and IR teams come in, do a pump and dump with existing assets and try to make an acquisition play. That‚Äôs what happened with CRFT. Their old CEO, Patrick Brauckmann did a P/D post IPO. Got it up to very high levels (didn‚Äôt raise at these levels) but rather sold off stock and the company crashed.

These guys are undergoing a re-org to re-position themselves away from Pasha Brands with a legitimate business model. 

**MY RATIONALE:**

&#x200B;

* First off, there's **massive      IR exposure** and a great story to tell to the markets ‚Äì this will move      the needle even before sales volumes as it's such a good story. They just      acquired AVA Pathways, a mushrooms research company to add that to the      investor story to play with $TRIP $MMED $CYBN and $CMPS.
* The company is broken out      into 3 different decisions, **with serious assets in play**
   * Cannabis in Canada (BC       Craft Supply, Meddcann Health Products)
   * Cannabis in the USA (Feel       well Brands)
   * Psychedelics in Canada (AVA       Pathways) markets.
* They have licenses and      facilities ‚Äì ASSETS at the end of the day. Things that can be sold if      needed. They're currently doing a $2m renovation on their facility in      Chemainus, and that's only 1/4 assets, and the stock market cap is only      $6M. **So undervalued right now.**
* **Redemption story** ‚Äì CEO Matt Watters      (previously CBD Therapeutics) coming back on board to right the ship. CFO      Regan McGrath is also very bright. The management team looks solid and I      vetted the major players with my network. Checks out.
* **Social cause** ‚Äì BC Craft is a gateway for      black market growers to get back into legal cannabis. There‚Äôs a lot here      that nobody is talking about with regards to bridging the gap for the      legacy market. Bringing the black market and making them be able to      compete with the regular market is a huge advantage and will rally a lot      of social support behind the company.
* **Proven access to funding** ‚Äì they just did a raise ‚Äì      deep connections to industry.
* **Stock at all-time lows ($0.045)** ‚Äì trading under asset value      given what they've paid.
* **Insider filings show all      insiders with options and warrants at +10c. Many at 12c/20c/28c**. They have an incentive to      build the stock from these levels ‚Äì 4/5c is extremely low in my opinion.      All of my plays are like this ‚Äì undervalued companies trying to get back      on track.
* Already successfully      launched Grizzlers pre-rolls into multiple markets with Alberta already      live, and Ontario, Quebec orders confirmed.
* They have licenses and      facilities ‚Äì ASSETS at the end of the day. Things that can be sold if      needed. They're currently doing a $2m renovation on their facility in      Chemainus, and that's only 1/4 assets, and the stock market cap is only      $6M. **So undervalued right now.**

**Take a look at these guys - with a new team, a new board, and a new name - I honestly think this is a MAJOR opportunity, especially as the USA legalizes. Canada cannabis, USA cannabis and CBD, and Canada psychedelics. CRFT has it all!!**",nlmn2v,TAKE A LOOK AT BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO ($CRFT)

As the title suggests, I believe there is a company that does not yet suffer from an insanely inflated valuation like most EV companies, has the potential to become a serious player in their own niche of the market and is bound to go through some amount of short squeeze in the near-future should they continue to execute. So let's start with a little background information:

**The Company**

Arcimoto ($FUV) is an electric vehicle company headquartered in Eugene, Oregon that sells a tandem two-seat, three-wheeled electric vehicle. It was founded by Mark Frohnmayer in 2007, after he sold his stake as a co-founder in game development company GarageGames. The idea for Arcimoto started when Frohnmeyer was looking for a small electric vehicle for his everyday trips around town to reduce his carbon footprint. He discovered the only options were a Tesla Roadster, which was clearly overkill, or a golf cart, which did not offer the right amount of utility.

**The Product(s)**

Enter the [Fun Utility Vehicle (FUV)](https://youtu.be/wG-tiCV3oX4), a tandem two-seat three wheeled electric motorcycle with an EPA-rated range of 102 city miles per charge and a size between that of a car and a traditional motorcycle. The vehicle will have a fuel economy of 173.7 MPGe at city driving speeds and is freeway capable, with a maximum speed of 75 mph (121 km/h). The company officially launched production and delivery of the retail Fun Utility Vehicle on September 19, 2019.

After the FUV, Arcimoto introduced alternative products called the [Rapid Responder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUNxakqvxw) (an emergency response vehicle), the [Deliverator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BS5r_7710) (a package/food delivery vehicle) and the [Roadster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYerp6fhMzY) (a roofless version of the FUV). All of these products are based on the same platform, allowing Arcimoto to save costs on manufacturing tools and production. The vehicles are already about 15% more energy efficient than the best EV (the Model 3), and Arcimoto is targeting to increase this to roughly 50%.

**The Execution**

Which brings us to the biggest caveat for the company. While I have a lot of faith in the CEOs drive to make this company a success, as well as the potential of the product, the company still has a lot to prove. In 2020 they delivered a total of 117 vehicles. While this might not sound like a lot, it is worth keeping in mind that Arcimoto has only invested roughly $100M into their company so far. For comparison, companies like Tesla, Lordstown, Fisker and Nikola had not delivered any cars after the first $100M investment.

That said, the biggest challenge for any EV company - as Elon Musk would be willing to attest to - is getting to full scale production. Arcimoto has recently purchased a new facility (the rAMP), which is targeted to have a manufacturing capacity of 50,000 units per year once fully operational. Additionally, this facility will function as a prototype for scale replication for global expansion. In other words, if this facility functions well, they will copy/paste the damn thing all around the planet.

Obviously this new facility comes with a lot of required investments and unknowns for the company, but also a lot of opportunity. In response to their plans and partially due to the hype around EV companies, the stock rose from little over $1 during the COVID crash to $36 ($1.5B market cap) during the peak in February.

**The Shorts**

Which brings us to the short situation around the company. While the company had had some trouble with aggressive short sellers pre-COVID, this seemed to be a thing of the past after their massive run-up during the recovery. But alas, the shorts had other plans. In March, just after the stock had mysteriously dropped more than 50% from its ATH (potentially in part due to the overall decline of growth stocks, but probably for other reasons we will get to), a law office announced an investigation into the company concerning possible violations of federal securities laws.

According to the law firm, Arcimoto had delivered ""less than 5%"" of the pre-orders it had touted since 2018 and that the Company‚Äôs largest customer is secretly owned and operated by an undisclosed related party, FOD Capital, LLC. Moreover, the report alleged that one day before Arcimoto touted a 90-day trial for first responder units in Orlando, the Company had filed a total production recall notice ""due to safety issues with the electronic drivers in the vehicles which can ‚Äòlead to unexpected battery shutdown and immediate loss of traction-power.‚Äô""

What followed were months of constant press releases about potential class action lawsuits and the stock price plummeting another 55%, to a low of $8. During the earnings call on May 18th, Frohnmayer stated that he believes the lawsuits are ""chock-full of falsehoods and misrepresentations"", that the lawsuit is based on a report by a short seller of the company's common-stock and that as of that time, ""no motion to certify a class has been filed"".

**The Squeeze**

I already wanted to put this post out earlier in the week, but didn't find the time for it. Today I felt I had to, before it was too late, as the stock suddenly shot up roughly 20% in a single day. This entire rise happened within 1,5 hours time, clearly suggesting (the beginnings of) a short squeeze to me.

**My Take**

While I have no definitive proof, I am quite convinced that the supposed class-action lawsuit is completely bogus and an attempt to drive the stock into the ground at the benefit of the short seller(s). The stock's short interest as of May 12th was roughly 30%, putting it in the top 8 most shorted stocks in the market. According to Yahoo Finance, this increased to 36% since. If you look at [the news coverage about the company in the past two months](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUV?p=FUV), the amount of spam about the law suit is quite frankly ridiculous with **57** separate news articles about the law suit, none of which contained any tangible information. This to me is quite clearly an aggressive marketing campaign to scare investors away from the company.

As for the shorts, my opinion is clear; the lawsuits is bogus and the stock is heavily overshorted. Today was the first step in a short squeeze that should take the stock back to its rightful levels. While it almost definitely got ahead of itself trading at $36 earlier this year, I believe it should at least be trading at 2x it's current values ($15-20) based on fundamentals.

As for the future of the company, I believe the pace at which they will be able to get the rAMP factory up and running will be crucial for the short term-outlook of the company. Long term their ability to drive costs down and whether they'll have enough demand to sell 50,000 units per year will determine whether this can become a multi-billion dollar company. If the demand is there, my projections tell me they could be in the $10-17B range by 2024.

**Tl;dr: Arcimoto (FUV) is a company that makes three-wheeled electric cross-overs between a car and a motorcycle and is trying to scale production from 100 to 50.000 units per year over the next couple of years, but is getting shorted into the ground based on a potentially (probably?) bogus lawsuit, and as such has become a tremendous investing opportunity.**",nlo48p,The EV company that has slipped past everybody's radar and is getting shorted into the ground

Mr. Li Cheng, CEO of IINX, said, ""The most prominent technical feature of the product is that the battery has super fast charging and discharging ability, and the battery can be fully charged as short as 12 minutes, which greatly saves charging time, this fast charging technology is at leading level of the industry in the world. Meanwhile, compared to nowadays mainstream lithium-ion batteries, the new aluminum ion battery does not overheat during the charging process and has better safety performance. Additionally, it also has the characteristics of broad adaptability in high and low temperature environment and lower manufacturing cost, which will bring greater advantages in the application field. We believe that the development of this new battery product with superior performance will bring great value to the company and its shareholders, and will become a new growth point for the company to increase profits.""",nlq40g,10min charging Alumion-Ion Fast Charging invented by a 16mill cap stock.

Then go to Yahoo finance and go to the financials tab of the company and pretend like you know what the numbers all mean.  Stare at the company's balance sheet untill your eyes cross. Then look at insider ownership.  If you like the sound of the names of the owners, that's great.  If they have strong names like ""Bill"" or ""Carl"" or ""Vinnie"" that's great.  If they sound weak like ""Kyle"" or ""Tucker"" don't invest.

Just keep repeating until you find a company you can convince yourself that you believe in.  It's more important that you believe in the company than the company actually be a good company.  That way when it dips you won't sell.

[‚ÄúThe country will prepare for a stable LNG supply as demand for the fuel can possibly be up to 52.53 million mt in 2034, in case of bigger demand for power production,"" the ministry official said.]

[‚ÄúAs part of efforts to ensure a stable supply, South Korea will diversify LNG imports sources,"" the MOTIE statement said.]

I just sold after it made its run, and now I‚Äôve decided to move all in on a Junior Mining Company, New Jersey Mining Company based out of Idaho in the Murray‚Äôs Gold Belt.  To my surprise there‚Äôs not really a dedicated subreddit for junior mining companies, so here‚Äôs hoping to get a little discussion going here perhaps. 

I‚Äôve made this move for two reasons. First, resource mining has always performed well during inflationary periods, so I figured why not? Secondly, I‚Äôve just found I enjoy speculating on JMCs rather than anything else I‚Äôve tried. I consider myself an avid rabbit-holer and I enjoy deep dives into companies fundamentals, and I mean deeeep. Like actually reading the 10-k/10-q filings. I do so to hedge against my anxiety that comes from speculating on such companies in the first place lol.

ANY INFORMATION POSTED HEREIN SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INVESTMENT ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

Now for some major points of my DD that brought me to the New Jersey Mining Company (NJMC):
  
‚Ä¢ First, I have to admit I clicked on this company at first solely because of their name (I am from the dirty Jerz myself call it tribal, or stupid idrc)
 
‚Ä¢ Secondly, It owns 100% interest in the Golden Chest Mine that consists of 25 patented mining claims covering an area of 280 acres and 90 unpatented claims mine covering an area of 1,390 acres. The mine is in production and they have their own mill to process the ore.

https://newjerseymining.com/production/

  ‚Ä¢ This map of the gold belt shows their unpatented as well as patented lands, and they even receive royalties from sections of Hecla‚Äôs Silver mines. 

https://newjerseymining.com/murray-gold-belt-map/

  ‚Ä¢ The management team has extensive knowledge and experience in each of their respective fields, and I am extremely confident in their plan of action.

https://newjerseymining.com/the-team/

‚Ä¢ In recent news they just discovered a significant gold-quartz vein within one of their patented lands. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-mining-co-discovers-significant-123000589.html

‚Ä¢  They also had a favorable Q1 of 2021 where revenue increased however gross profit was down due to a rare high wind storm power outage and equipment repairs which were delayed due to shipping delays of replacement parts. They made significant advances in drilling and ore tonnage.  I believe that despite the loss they will come through strong in the subsequent quarters.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-mining-company-provides-first-130000187.html

‚Ä¢ Also as of two days ago, NJMC hit a double gold vein in their Paymaster shoot. Which reinforces their plan to drill deeper.

(((selling price) \* \~75% ownership ) - \~10% Closing Costs) / shares

140k acres is a lot, so it'll probably be somewhat difficult to move all of them together, so they might take a price lower than 40k.  So, let's just assume 10k/acre for a lowball estimate.  Also, there is no tax on the on the sale, since it's university lands (don't ask me, it's just what I've read).

(140k \* 10k) = 1.4B

1.4B \* .75 = 1.05B

1.05B - 105M = 945M

So by now most already know about the new SEC rules regarding OTC market.   If you don't, here is a link to OTCmarkets site with their updated SEC rules [https://www.otcmarkets.com/corporate-services/information-for-pink-companies?utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=OTC%20Markets%20Monthly%20News\_May%202021&utm\_content=OTC%20Markets%20Monthly%20News\_May%202021+CID\_b2ac81d06e41a399187b84926cb5d71a&utm\_source=Email%20Campaign&utm\_term=here](https://www.otcmarkets.com/corporate-services/information-for-pink-companies?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=OTC%20Markets%20Monthly%20News_May%202021&utm_content=OTC%20Markets%20Monthly%20News_May%202021+CID_b2ac81d06e41a399187b84926cb5d71a&utm_source=Email%20Campaign&utm_term=here). You will see the current rules and the updated rules below.

I   am thinking once companies who are not current or in danger of not   being traded on public exchanges start dropping filing after filing,   there will be the beginning of an OTC trend.

Lets   assume not every company will or can go current. So I wanted a place   for us to post a company ticker that we feel will make all the   appropriate filings to go pink current with updated information. Lets   not forget, there are Pink current with no information. SEC wants   updated information, but if you read the rules, you will also see   international companies who are listed on a major exchange with no   information on OTC are exempt from the rules and can remain current pink   on OTC.

**So who can get current before September**?   I ask that you PLEASE do not post just any OTC ticker. Post tickers   that you know is not current/missing info, is still active, and you feel   they have put in enough time and money to grow that they would be   foolish not to get current. Also please give an explanation why you   think they are a good candidate to go current before September and if   you want to include links that is fine too.

I will start,

424,,2021-05-23 19:49:14,t3_njfk83,,pennystocks,"Huge upcoming moves for somewhat hidden gem WRHLF - Love Hemp. Currently Listed on OTCQB (and AQSE under $LIFE).

The run up this week to June 1 and beyond could be huge. The current SP is a minuscule 4.1 cents compared to it's potential in the short term. Seems to be flying under the radar for the most part - has relatively low volume thus far.

The company has a promotional partnership with UFC effective June 1 ([https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/rmqd5vw](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/rmqd5vw)), with North American expansion marketing access to UFC fans. The agreement allows Love Hemp to access UFC‚Äôs physical and digital assets, as well as the marketing opportunities. This includes usage of UFC trademarks, logos and brand on a global basis, which will increase visibility and recognition across the 625 million UFC fans worldwide. Products are expected to be co-branded and UFC promotion of the company will begin.

Beyond the 1st, they'll continue taking off and growing the business and SP:

CATALYSTS

Possibly this week: PRs around ramping up for the June 1 UFC partnership and North America expansion, including the completion of the new production facility to increase volume up to 5x from current levels and will have the capacity to manufacture up to 500,000 CBD products a month.

June 1: Starts exclusive 5 year CBD partnership with UFC.

June 1: North American launch (currently in the UK market) to coincide with UFC partnership.

2021: Intent to up-list to London Stock Exchange (Europe's largest exchange) [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/x8o469r](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/x8o469r)

2021: Expansion into Japan/Germany/Korea/Australia. Will be within in 1 day delivery of 1 billion customers.

\-28mil market cap and approx 10mil sales. Many CBD companies have far higher market cap valuations though they have less sales. So much room for growth with this ticker on that fact alone. Virtually no debt. 8.89% owned by insiders / 16.63% owned by insiders + the largest (non-insider) shareholder. 83% publicly held shares.

\-Currently selling at \~2000 physical locations (including leading brands such as Sainsbury‚Äôs, Boots, Ocado and Holland & Barrett) with 40 product lines. Once the UFC deal gets underway, expected to increase volume massively as UFC consumers demand product. Amazing listing likely imminent.

\-U.S. Legal Cannabis Market Projected to Double to $41.5B by 2025 ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/09/2142171/0/en/U-S-Legal-Cannabis-Market-Projected-to-Double-to-41-5B-by-2025.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/09/2142171/0/en/U-S-Legal-Cannabis-Market-Projected-to-Double-to-41-5B-by-2025.html)). No doubt Love Hemp is well positioned over that time to capitalize on the growth of the market with the UFC partnership deal in particular. 

\-Founders of Love Hemp also founded Supreme Cannabis. They've recently re-signed (UFC's) Kamaru Usman as Brand Ambassador (Apr 22/2021 [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/w6qj3kr](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/w6qj3kr)) GSP was also a brand ambassidor previously.

On the flip side, with outstanding warrants shares could dilute up to around 29% eventually. However, not concerned as the current valuations and catalysts far outweigh the effects of the potential dilution. 

IMO amazing entry pricing at this point, considering the upcoming short and longer/2021-term catalysts. I'm in with avg 4 cents for \~100k and looking to add more this week as possible.

Not too long ago Rolls Royce announced that it acquired the company Servowatch Systems with the aim of entering the ship automation industry. It is a significant development and one that will pay dividends long term. They also have recently partnered with Infosys a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. This will be used in their upcoming movement towards ship automation.

The good outlook 

A turning point?
Rolls-Royce sells jet engines for airliners along with many other ventures but it makes most of its profits from aftersales maintenance and support services. When aircraft are grounded, airlines don‚Äôt need these services because the engines aren‚Äôt in use.

However, that situation is starting to change. Aero engineer Meggitt reports that domestic flying in markets such as the US and China has already rebounded strongly. Here in the UK, the government is expected to start lifting restrictions on travel to Europe in May. Rolls-Royce isn‚Äôt expected to return to profit until late 2021 into 2022. But the stock market always looks forward and I think we‚Äôre at a turning point. In my view, the outlook for Rolls-Royce will start to improve during the second half of this year drastically. They are priced for bankruptcy on the market and this is way too pessimistic when aligned with the reality of how soon they can start to turn profit and what they have lined up. - This is from an analysis not me but matches my opinion. 

It's coming boys, patience is a virtue. Plus how safe can you get. Check the chart. It's an INVESTMENT. I understand that's a very rare word around here but tell me the last year has been normal. 

But why not leave you more, don't sleep on a solid investment.

There are new rules coming in to affect soon with stocks traded on OTC market. This rule is affective on September 28 2021. 

 The new rule requires that all companies quoted on OTC market must disclose current information on a continuous basis, effective September 28, 2021.   Securities that do not meet the Rule‚Äôs disclosure standard will have their public quotes removed from Pink as of the September deadline.  

OTC market suggests getting their updated info to OTC by June 30th to be sure their is enough time to review their current status.

Companies like EEENF are exempt from this rule because they are current on a foreign exchange.

What companies do you think that you are watching that are not current will most likely get all of their disclosures up to date. Ill start $PHIL

Town sports no longer owns NYSC BSC PSC and WSC. These assets were sold off to a private company and are not part of the stock. 

Patrick Walsh is still CEO of these clubs and had alot of his personal money invested in town sports which makes me belive he will do alot not to cancel the shares.

So where to from here? Does the gym world pick up now that the pandemic is over in the US? I think so.

Does this stock get canceled? It seems town sports international llc was a subsidiary of Town sports holdings llc which also owned the premium clubs which aren't listed in the bankruptcy papers at all. I checked and don't see them.

430,,2021-05-24 04:42:01,t3_njpq9i,,pennystocks,"I know the general deal with sub-penny stocks and have been investing on and off for a couple of  years now as a hobby. I have learned to use various stock screeners, look at Market Cap, previous week and month performance, 52-week range, the day's range, volume, average volume, do my research in various places for upcoming catalysts, news, new products, new ownership, acquisitions of other companies, etc.  I have also learned to check the 5-day and 1-month pricing, search for stocks that have dropped like 90% in price recently due to the market being down in general (because the odds of them going back up are pretty good) and stuff like that. Heck, I even do research to see how many actual working employees a company has and won't invest in a company with one employee (just the CEO).

I have YOLO'ed into a number of .0001 penny stocks months ago when virtually every sub-penny stock was growing like crazy for no reason. Made thousands of dollars in profit during that time. I have also meticulously researched stocks, went with the flow of the masses and invested like crazy with tens of thousands of other people only to find out that a couple of ""great"" companies were a sham and their CEO was prosecuted because said product didn't exist at all.

I have learned the difference between market orders, limit orders and stop loss orders. A lot of what I have done so far, even when I took big losses, taught me valuable lessons of what to do and what not to do in the future. Now I'm looking for more info.

I have used the stock screeners of [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com) and learned to look for the stocks that are defunct, have a stop sign on them, suspended by the SEC, etc. I've learned to look for signs that the company is going nowhere or potentially a scam. I have also used [barchart.com](https://barchart.com) and some other places for even more screening of stocks because with otcmarkets, while helpful in some ways in regards to finding out if a stock is legit or not, the actual stock price is always incorrect. Typically it is already way higher than what otcmarkets lists. It will say .0001 and when you look on somewhere like Yahoo Finance or any broker website, the price is like .0015 and has been for sometimes weeks.

I know that in general .0001 stocks are a shot in the dark. However, if one researches a good company that already has a decent amount of employees, potential future news/catalysts and such...it can't go down anymore without going out of business. The chances of it going up are much higher, however.

I find that I have problems buying a lot of sub-penny stocks even when they have SEC filings/earnings posted, I exceed the bid price, match the current ask price and it has tens or even hundreds of millions in volume daily. It just sits there until the day is done and the order is still ""open"" for no reason. I've noticed that a lot lately, even with stocks that have hundreds of millions of shares being traded daily. I see nothing that I'm doing incorrectly.

I have also noticed that some sites like [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com) are way more up to date with more .0001 stocks and current prices compared to even [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com) and that's a bit puzzling.

This got me to wondering...is there a website where I can find NEW .0001 startup companies that don't have a large following yet and are just coming to market? Surely there has to be SOME kind of official list at the SEC or elsewhere where these new startup companies are listed when they first go onto the market as a .0001 stock. Granted, it could be a long time before they actually see growth. In the meantime, I'm one of the people who starts out with a million shares, waits for it to go to .0002 and sells, then buys back 2 million shares again at .0001. I like to gather tens of millions of shares and then hold for future growth. Then do the same for other stocks simultaneously.

IF TLDR: What sites do you guys use for stock screeners for .0001 penny stocks and where can I find an official list of new companies coming to the market as .0001 stocks?

I know that a lot of .0001 stocks were also previously existing companies that had a higher stock price and some scandal, issue, etc., happened and they fell down to a triple zero stock. But I don't feel that it is unreasonable in any way to think that there must be a list somewhere of officially new companies that are literally just starting out and offering stocks at .0001. There has to be somewhere. Where can I find it and what is it called?",njpq9i,Is there an official page where NEW startup companies are listed as .0001 stocks?

It seems that pennystocks and OTCs in particular, fundemental DD seems to resolve around, company dropping fins and working on current status followed by shareholder letter or some big announcement, or other news like mergers, custos, reinstatements, etc... 

Basically it seems that DD for OTCs is more short term and riding the hype and not something like ""hey this 5B outstanding shares company has a cool concept and good growth potential for next 5 years"" so its tough for me to value it long term.

I am curious how to value these things short term? Like if I catch an unknown company today that's likely going to reverse merger and I know which company it will reverse into then I would be all over it cos I know no matter what it will explode when rest of traders catch on and so I wouldn't know how to value it but I would just be guessing that hype will run up like we seen with GGII, TSNP etc...

Second, how do you DD these OTCs? They don't produce books for how to do this haha, their are some twitter people that do have courses like @KickoStocks and @ShortSqueezed1 who have courses on OTC trading just not sure I am willing to pay for this stuff... I heard people say to keep it simple, to use otcmarkets to view fins and mergers and to use another website (forgot the name its paid subscription) to view reinstatements etc...",njuouv,Is it enough to read DD posted by others on reddit and twitter or you need your own DD?

436,,2021-05-24 14:13:35,t3_njyxbk,,pennystocks,"CAPEX Concerns were raised after my original Due Diligence posts on **$PBT** by a few contributors in pennystocks. After originally creating a comment I realized that this comment needed to be its own post since there are a lot of factors to consider. My first 2 posts assume that we are entering a super cycle of commodities and as of Q1 2021 this has been proven by the price of WTI Crude Oil and new worldwide consumption. 

**TLDR Shortcut:** The thesis remains that markets are forward looking at oil price rise above $70 is a technical break indicator with price discovery that we have not seen in over a decade(Summer 2008). The market's bullishness towards commodities recently are reflective of inflation and oil prices specifically are on a major run as COVID exposure worldwide is decreasing. Price target remains of $17-22 through Aug.

Increased drilling costs on the Waddell Ranch properties resulting in a deficiency for the NPI. Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the first quarter of 2021 totaled $9.5. At first glance this seems like an issue but US Shale are tight plays that require consistent drilling and fracking which was not done during the decline on 2016-2020 on the Permian Basin properties. The cumulative NPI deficit is **$7,645,016** for the underlying property (at 75%). The NPI deficit must be recovered from future proceeds of the Waddell Ranch properties prior to any other proceeds being paid to the Trust. Total Oil proceeds for Waddell reached **$12,245,665** for the first quarter of 2021. We have a current amount of unknowns such as new well production but we can make certain assumptions based on the knowledge of shale Oil that new wells have a higher production value and older wells have a declining production value. With the addition of the new wells we should see a large jump in oil production from both properties and we already have an increase in oil prices that are at a price target of $65 which is 11% higher than previous year.

Blackbeard has previously informed the Trustee that the 2021 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $88.6 million (gross) ($32.5 million net to the Trust) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The Trustee has been advised that there were **27 workover wells completed, 8 new wells completed, 8 new wells in progress and 9 workover wells in progress during the three months ended March 31, 2021**. The Waddell Ranch is being targeted for production because of the mass amount of oil rich acreage, pipeline placement, and service company ease of access to keep costs down. Texas Royalty Properties is the only producing acreage for Q1 towards the dividend but will have a declining production value while Waddell Ranch should have a massive increase in production value based on the current drilling activity. Unlike certain areas, the Permian Basin has highly proven well production based on exploration technology where all drills are producing wells thanks to fracturing technology. Also the cost of well service companies are still contributing to a lower cost to produce if you follow major service companies like baker Hughes, Halliburton, Fractech, ect..

At the end of Q1 the average per day output production was:

**Oil** 2,379 on an average price of $58.13(**Current WTI price $64.46**)

**Gas** 10,313 with an average price of $1.60(**Current Gas price $2.90**)

&#x200B;

The net profits/overriding royalty interest in the Waddell Ranch properties is the largest asset of the Trust. The mineral interests in the Waddell Ranch, from which such net royalty interests are carved, vary from 37.5% (Trust net interest) to 50% (Trust net interest) in 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres. A majority of the proved reserves are attributable to six fields: Dune, Sand Hills (Judkins), Sand Hills (McKnight), Sand Hills (Tubb), University-Waddell (Devonian) and Waddell. At December 31, 2020, the Waddell Ranch properties contained 648 gross (221 net) productive oil wells, 109 gross (39 net) productive gas wells and 209 gross (67 net) injection wells. Six major fields on the Waddell Ranch properties account for more than 80% of the total production. In the six fields, there are 12 producing zones ranging in depth from 2,800 to 10,600 feet

**Directly from PBT 10-K**

>The Waddell Ranch properties are mature producing properties, and all of the major oil fields are currently being **waterflooded** for the purpose of **facilitating enhanced recovery.** Proved reserves and estimated future net revenues attributable to the properties are included in the reserve reports summarized below.

Estimated quantities of proved developed reserves of oil and gas as of the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands): 

https://preview.redd.it/smt6yvlgp2171.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e49591410caf24941f74df9984b1549b3ad2515

Average oil and gas prices of $65.56 per barrel and $3.11 per Mcf were used to determine the estimated future net revenues from the Waddell Ranch properties and the Texas Royalty properties, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The question raised by my previous posts is if we enter a commodities super cycle will the price of oil exceed $70 and if it does what is the underlying price of **$PBT** represented. An average price of $70 with a proven production value, not factoring in new drilling, **adds an additional $19.75M($4.44/barrel\*4450k)**. If oil prices enter a more bullish cycle similar to 2008 with reopening being complete and a roaring 20s style spending happens for the next Quarter, we could potentially see an average Oil price of $85 for a short period of time in July/Aug which is my targeted timeline and **adds an additional $86.5M($19.75/barrel \*4450k)**.  

The volume of daily shares has been suppressed for a  year which is the average shown but historically was much higher, which leads me to believe we are still early for the upside. For  example in 2008 when oil went on a large run the daily volume reached  +3M at one point. When price for oil is high and the dividend is fully  restored the average volume was around 400k/day and spikes of +1M with a  trading price of $17-22 or $6.8-8.8M/day.

If you refer to my original post, a good portion of shares are institutional or wrapped in a 1031 through a corporation. I learned  about the 1031 connection through some business associates I have in the  Permian Basin that have done this when selling their real estate and  parking the capital during down turns. I believe this will help keep a  large portion of shares locked up as the price rises since a 1031 is a  process and usually a planned event.",njyxbk,CAPEX update on $PBT expanding on previous DD (PT $17-22)

438,,2021-05-24 16:02:17,t3_nk1cla,,pennystocks,"Background: For the past few months, PPBT has been trading in a channel of 3.80 to 4.75. The company has 65 million cash on hand and currently sits at a market cap of 80 million, and will be presenting for the first time human phase 1b/2 clinical data on NT219 on 6/4 at the ASCO conference. For now, the presentation will only include monotherapy and combination therapy with cetuximab, but with preclinical humanized mouse data that looks like this: 

https://preview.redd.it/m8swwrp853171.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&s=9950b44d2116f92d04729e869033c04951b88869

And having the drug already cleared as safe in humans via phase 1a, it's a fairly safe bet that the results are going to be pretty good - the above data represents results for human tumors implanted into mice. As it stands NT219 seems to have strong synergistic effects with almost any drug its paired with as it prevents drug-tumor resistance, and is a small molecule that can cross the blood brain barrier, allowing it to potentially be a part of combination therapies for traditionally hard to treat cancers as well, such as neck and brain cancer. Additionally, the lead researcher behind NT219 trials recently got an award from the American Association for Cancer Research roughly a month ago. 

&#x200B;

Technicals: The price currently sits at a price of 4.54 and has a RSI of 60.5, so it may be good to wait for a slightly better entry point - I could see a dip of going to the 4.20s in the next two weeks, but I doubt it will get back to the 3.80s with the upcoming catalyst. The company has an extremely tight share structure of 17.5m and an average float of 300,000, so if it moves it will move fast, likely a single day breakout of over 100% as seen with tickers like SYSX. IMO the smart play here is to open up a small entry position and buy as the dips come, or at the breakout past key resistance at $5.00. Since fundamentally the cash value on hand of the company is around 60m, or \~$3.80 per share, even if everything goes poorly the play has a downside of \~20%. If this starts ripping there will likely be a sell off at \~7 to get in if you're late to the party, but short term price targets of $25 (500m market cap) are fairly realistic given they potentially have IP of a highly versatile best-in-class drug that addresses unmet market needs (head and neck cancer). As a long hold, if this gets past Phase 3 this is easily a $100+ stock (2b market cap). As it stands right now, the value of the drug seems ridiculously undervalued and unpriced in, and once topline data for p1b/2 gets released a major risk factor will be removed for more investors to jump in.

Doubleview identifies, acquires, and finances quality base metal exploration mining projects in North America and more specifically British Columbia, Canada.

Doubleview endeavours to increase the odds of exploration success and to mitigate investment risk through diversification.

Now as of right now there leads to be no proof of when the drilling will continue, but I‚Äôm very bullish on this stock in the coming weeks as they have been drilling here for over 7 years, and have been making consistent deals with the tribe along the way.

443,,2021-05-24 18:57:54,t3_nk5dvg,,pennystocks,"Spearmint Resources had some news today about starting their Phase II work plan on the Goose Gold Project located less than 1 km from the New Found Golds discovery hole ""Keats"". The news of the company begining work programs on their gold projects at this time is very welcome news as the company is flirting with all time highs based almost exclusively on the success of their lithium project. With a number of projects expected to be advanced this year including the lithium I think this company is poised to move up to new levels again over the course of the next couple weeks and months.

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spearmint-begin-phase-ii-program-070100336.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spearmint-begin-phase-ii-program-070100336.html)

The company lists 14 projects on their website however I believe they will only be actively working on the ones that should provide the most value for the company over the next 12 months. With that in mind, I am going to list the ones I think have some potential for focus now.

Goose Gold Project - Located within a KM of the Keats discovery, a discovey that has taken New Found Gold from penny stock to a massive market cap over 1.5B, this small claim has huge potential for a discovery. Based on its specific location it well may be a cash cow for the company if it wanted to sell to the other mining companies in the area once their work program is complete this year. I understand the planned program is for a small grid sampling mag survey and drilling on targets. We will need to see where the work goes but this will provide lots of news and updates as the program continues.

Perron East Gold Project - Located in Quebec, in the area of the Amex Exploration Inc and Starr Peaks discoveries, Spearmint has several claim that have been advanced through work with Laurentia Exploration. Work to date has included some airborne magnetic surveys and sampling. Laurentia is highly respected and in demand in the area as they have been responsible for the other companies discoveries. Recent news from Spearmint highlighted flow though cash being raised  which as stated by they company will be primarily used to advance a drilling program on the Perron properties. These properties have several faults on them and have lots of potential for a significant discovery.

Clayton Valley Clay project. - Located in Nevada bordering Cypress development. This project is where Spearmint is seeing most of it's current attention and value. The company completed an aggressive 10 hole drilling program in 2020 and hit the lithium bearing clay in every single hole. Samples from that program are currently undergoing metallurgy and initial tests showed 83% extraction. Currently these results are being confirmed but they are expected any time now. When the results are complete there will be a report done by Stantec that will highlight resource estimates and viability of the project. This is now an asset and whether the results indicate that more drilling is required or if they have enough for a reasonable estimate this project changes everything for this company. As lithium prices increase with demand this project will just add value. It is important to know,  other companies are spending millions on research and development in the area including CYP, ALB, PE and SLB. All of the investment directly helps SPMT in the proving of extraction methods make all the projects viable.

Clayton Valley Brine Project. - Several claims for Brine production. Not currently drilled as brine wells are very cost prohibitive costing up to 1m per hole. Pure Energy is partnered with Schlumberger to build extraction plants and refinery in the area proving that investment in the brine is also viable. I will be looking forward to announcements on these claims in the future as it seems like a really easy fit in regards to continuing to develop assets.

Several BC gold projects seem to be far down on the list so I don't expect them to get much attention with the focus being on eastern Canada based on the news however the company has a few projects that could be interesting. One is their vanadium project near  Chibougamau and another is the Case Lake Cesium Project. Both located near significant discoveries and with commodities that are on the critical list I think these could get some attention this year.

Anyway, I am bullish on the company. I have 150K shares currently and think it is going way higher. I expect lots of catalyst to come from the company virtually weekly for the foreseeable future so if nothing else we should learn were we stand in regards to the projects shortly. I won't provide any price target as until we know what the value of the Lithium is and what kind of results from the work programs are it will remain a very fluid situation. That said, I think it will keep chugging up aver the next several months.

As always, do some DD for yourselves. This is looking like a trans-formative year for this company. More cash in bank than at any time in company history and several key work programs planned and ongoing. Not sure what else you would want on a JR exploration company.",nk5dvg,$SPMT/$SPMTF Spearmint Resources News. 0.175/.0155

449,,2021-05-25 00:42:09,t3_nkcvlf,,pennystocks,"**Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor.  What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks.  They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants.  A little complicated, but hope you follow.  Exact wording from the agreement:  ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out  (x) 100 = $153  **+**
2. $1.00  equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume  being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

&#x200B;

**LED Funding IV LLC**  [LED Funding - Energy Efficient Lighting Solutions (smartguard-energy.com)](https://smartguard-energy.com/) 

 I was going to write up a bunch of my own info here but it seems their websites FAQ site really does a great job of answering all the questions I had when viewing this from a client's point of view to see what kind of value they bring to the table. So here is a copy and paste from:

 [Frequently Asked Questions - LED Funding (smartguard-energy.com)](https://smartguard-energy.com/frequently-asked-questions/) 

>WHAT MAKES YOUR COMPANY DIFFERENT FROM MANY OTHERS IN THE MARKET?  
>  
>**We design, install, finance & service LED lighting & solar installations with a national footprint, all with a 10 year warranty covering any material failures & related labor replacement costs. We structure our financing so that our clients are always cash flow positive throughout the 10 year term. This results in dramatic & compelling savings for our clients who typically achieve IRR‚Äôs of 30% or more on the cost of a LED lighting installation over 10 years. Bottomline: the only cost our clients are responsible for is the cost of the electricity which, of course, operates at significantly reduced wattage levels as more fully described below. We know of no other credible national company offering this value proposition.**   
>  
>  
>  
>HOW IS IT POSSIBLE BY INSTALLING LED LIGHT TO REDUCE YOUR ENERGY BILL BY MORE THAT 50%? I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS 50% OF WHAT?  
>  
>**LED lights reduce current existing wattage draws of greater than 50%. For example, if you replace a 100 watt fluorescent lamp with a 40 watt LED lamp, by the laws of physics you save 60 watts while maintaining the same luminosity. There can be no other result. We then quantify those direct energy savings using the following formula: (current existing wattage MINUS new LED lamp wattage) x (number of lights) x (run hours of operation) x (current kWh rate). In addition to the savings generated from the wattage reduction by switching from Fluorescent to LED lights there are additional savings generated. One is by the elimination of the lighting maintenance associated with fluorescent lights that cost goes away with LED lights plus a small adjustment for a reduction in AC usage since LED lights operate ‚Äúcool‚Äù, ie., they don‚Äôt throw off heat which causes increased AC usage ‚Äì that equals the total energy savings.**   
>  
>  
>  
>WHAT LED MANUFACTURER DOES YOUR COMPANY USE? NOT ALL LED'S ARE CREATED EQUAL!  
>  
>**You are absolutely correct with that statement. We use only major, nationally recognized Tier 1 LED lighting manufacturers with UL or DLC certifications that have unquestioned financial credibility to back up their 10 year material/labor warranty. Furthermore, because of our nationwide operations and large volume of LED business, we can obtain significant discounts from the lighting manufacturers which are not generally available to the public.**   
>  
>  
>  
>WHEN YOU SAY NO OUT OF POCKET COST CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY?  
>  
>**What we mean by saying that our clients have no out-of-pocket cost is that we finance 100% of the cost of the retrofit in the form of a loan or finance lease for usually a 5 year term at competitive interest rates. Therefore, during the loan or lease amortization period clients will be cash flow positive meaning that the realized energy savings will always exceed the financing cost by a minimum of 10% ‚Äì this amount is usually significantly higher than 10%. Once the loan/lease amortization period is over, clients realize in cash the full amount of the calculated savings. Please be aware that there are significant tax benefits which our clients may be able to realize based on our finance structuring strategy.**   
>  
>  
>  
>HOW DO YOU MEASURE AND VERIFY SAVINGS?  
>  
>**For direct energy savings, we do a lighting audit which effectively consists of counting all existing lights & their wattages after which the savings are calculated as set forth above. After installation, we perform a measurement & verification using the IPMV protocol which verifies that the installed LED lights function at the rated wattage levels. A report of this M&V is provided to clients when completed.**

**SmartGuard Solutions** 

For this bit, it was not as simple to figure out as the Smartguard Solutions (SGS) site encompasses all of the services including robots-as-a-service, UV disinfection products, and all the energy products/services mentioned above. This is where many people do tend to get confused with all the different M&A activity. As far as I've come to understand it SGS, for the purposes of the FOMO Corp acquisition, will include the disinfection products, BUT NOT ROBOTICS.... for now. This is also on Vik's (FOMO's CEO) radar to acquire over time according to his bigger plans/goals he's discussed publicly. 

> SmartGuard-Solutions is marketing disinfection products with its own outreach and is negotiating joint marketing and sales agreements with several national maintenance and commercial real estate companies gaining time to market and scale advantages and extending its footprint throughout the country. The centerpiece of these marketing efforts is the offering of various types of Disinfection as a Service (‚ÄúDaaS‚Äù) models to clients using funding that has been provided to SGS by institutional investors. SGS believes that these marketing efforts will fuel the growth of ‚Äúas a Service‚Äù models which will provide short-term revenue and eliminate CapEx needs for its clients while, at the same time, provide the opportunity to generate long-term, annuity-type revenues. Such a recurring revenue model provides visibility to future revenues and cashflows and mirrors the strategy employed by SmartGuard Energy (https://smartguard-energy.com), also under definitive agreement for sale to FOMO. 

From Vik (FOMO CEO) regarding the real benefits of the Smartguard-Energy:

Their product beat out 19 others and has been labeled a ""**unique or highly specialized‚Äù product.**  

&#x200B;

**HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER**

Well if haven't yet started assembling the pieces of the puzzle yourself, notice how each of the 3 entities mentioned above address a different need that buildings need, both with the current pandemic in mind but also the need for the world to address our energy issues. Having a company which can supply financing for these projects, the consultants/experts to design the systems, and the actual products themselves they are building a one-stop shop for disinfection and energy efficiency for large buildings and indoor public spaces. 

But wait.. .there's more.

I'll save you a lot of reading here and link to site with a short description.

Already acquired:

**Purge Virus -**  [Home - (purgevirus.com)](https://purgevirus.com/) 

Has a number of products, including smaller disinfection units based on UV light, portable solutions, and also bi-polar ionization in air ducts. Also, they procure PPE and offer installation services. Currently, their big news is a partnership with SOS (Safely Opening Schools) which makes available disinfection products to 130,000 public schools in the US.

**Independence LED** [Home | US Made 10 Year Warranty | Independence LED Lighting Solutions](https://independenceled.com/) 

Has similar services to SGE but they also manufacture their own lights in the USA. This is a big deal as they are also on the GSA Schedule which means GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, which also means other products offered by the acquisition targets, once the contracts are signed, will also be available for Gov't purchases!!!!!!!!

**Energy Intelligence Center**  [Home - Energy Intelligence Center](https://energyintelligencecenter.com/) 

EIC is an interesting one. They are all about optimization of existing systems for energy efficiency using Artificial Intelligence. I must say, I got lost down the rabbit hole on this one trying to understand it, but the tech behind it is very interesting. My very crude understanding of what is happening is using space inside buildings to store heat or cool air to redistribute later... honestly, I don't want to stick my foot in my mouth here so I'll just say read up... its fascinating to say the least. Here is a copy/past from their ""about"" page:

> The Energy Intelligence Center focuses on energy efficiency consulting and sustainability solutions. We start with the ‚Äúlow hanging fruit‚Äù by upgrading commercial property lighting and air conditioning as well as ventilation and refrigeration systems. We can save 50% or more on lighting with LEDs and save over 15% on HVAC, without changing any of the cooling equipment or impacting thermostat settings. For our energy intelligence, we integrate with existing Building Management Systems (BMS) and Building Automation Systems (BAS) as well as provide optimization for facilities that do not have BMS/BAS.

I've given you tons of information to rattle around your brains. Once I really got a handle on EVERYTHING that is going on here it was easy to see the value of the ""ecosystem"" (as he refers to it) Vik is trying to create. Each of these different pieces compliment each other in one way or another. When I thought one part might have been redundant, I found that they are quite different. For example, Ecolite manufactures LEDs, as does Independence LED, but Ecolite's manufacturing is done overseas allowing for two different tiers of products, depending on the clients wishes/budget/needs etc. 

The thing is that this isn't just a simple Covid play, or a Green energy play, or an AI powered efficiency, or a solar power play... ITS ALL OF THE ABOVE. 

Vik has long dreamt of creating CSTI 2.0. For those who aren't aware, CSTI was a tech company incubator in the late 90's early 00's that did quiet well for a long while. He wants to help these great ideas become even greater companies by having them work together to solve the problems facing building owners/operators/managers today while keeping in line with positive trends in all things energy related.

Right now, you can purchase this stock on a discount. Not long ago FOMC was trading over .02 on just the LOIs about SGE and Ecolite and the acquisition of Purge Virus. Now SGS is in the picture as well and funding is in place. If anyone is having trouble seeing the potential here then I don't know how else to explain it. 

The future will be bright here. Do you have the foresight to jump in early?

&#x200B;

Finally, check out this list of disclosures. Everything Vik does, he screams at the SEC and FINRA, look at me, this is what i'm up to.. .I'm telling everybody. So anyone who thinks something shady might be going on realize that NO ONE EVER would scream to regulators look at me, if they had something to hide.

Green technology innovators Cicle, Inc. and American Battery Metals Corporation [(OTCQB:ABML)](https://pr.report/TZR70fEq), an American-owned lithium-ion battery recycling technology and advanced extraction company with extensive mineral resources in Nevada, which is in the process of changing its name to American Battery Technology Company (""ABTC"") announced today a strategic partnership to create the first-of-its-kind centralized service operations for collection and recycling of electric vehicle batteries at Cicle EV ChargeParks. The ventures will team up to meet heightened consumer demand as all leading global automakers and truck fleets transition to electric mobility.

The strategic partnership solves a critical renewable energy supply problem for the fast-growing EV ecosystem. The growth of electric vehicles has so far relied on environmentally unfriendly and inefficient local power grids to supply energy for recharging short-range batteries in cars and trucks. The ABTC & Cicle ChargeParks collaboration creates a practical and highly advanced renewable energy technology solution.

Cicle ChargeParks patent-pending infrastructure is designed to recharge consumer EV's efficiently as well as house multiple ABTC collection points and operations across North America. ABTC may then collect the spent and damaged EV batteries and other lithium-ion products for recycling and core metals processing. Results: Cicle clean, safe & rapid EV charging facilities working collaboratively with ABTC green extraction and processing of metal battery components used to build high-range EV batteries that will drive the electric vehicle revolution.

""Together, Cicle and ABTC are creating an entirely new industry focused on carbon-negative facilities to accommodate a cutting-edge technology infrastructure, renewable energy operations and consumer experiences for the coming EV transformation,"" said Cicle CEO and Founder John Strisower. ""Cicle is designing its experiential and technical platform to capture, store and distribute clean power, including solar, wind, hydrogen as well as utilize mega-batteries so consumers and truckers will have the optimal EV experience for themselves - and the planet.""

""American Battery Metals Company is powering the future of clean energy through our advanced methodology for battery recycling,"" said Doug Cole, CEO of ABTC, which is expected to process about 20,000 tons of batteries annually with the fastest turnover of materials in the marketplace. ""Our team is thrilled to bring its world-class core metals chemical extraction and mineral recycling technology together with Cicle's ChargeParks infrastructure to create centralized, convenient collection of electric vehicle batteries and other lithium-ion powered tools and consumer electronics.""

As part of the concept, ABTC would support the recycling of EV batteries collected at future Cicle facilities. ABTC is proactively working to permit and construct a pilot battery recycling plant in Fernley, NV. The company is pioneering a closed-loop battery recycling process at this pilot plant that will separate and recover critical materials from end-of-life high-power batteries, as well as from defects and waste from battery manufacturing facilities. The recovered metals are refined to battery-grade specifications and then sold back into the supply chain in a true closed-loop process. This recycling process will be a critical component if the U.S. is to successfully meet the increasing demand for these critical materials.",nkouht,[ABML] American Battery Metals Corporation and Cicle ChargeParks Form Strategic Partnership!

Good day everybody,

We are continuing coverage on **Troika Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRKA**

Current price $2.96/share

We alerted TRKA shares at $2.92/share in Monday‚Äôs session. After reaching a high of $3.15 early in the session the shares pulled back closing at $2.96 (+1.37%) per share.

**Consider:**

¬∑ Tiny float.

¬∑ Trading 42% off IPO price one month ago

¬∑ The acquisition of Redeeem may act as a catalyst for the company‚Äôs value.

¬∑ Blue chip client list.

Yesterday we mentioned that TRKA listed sixty big named clients and we want to show them to you:

Coca-Cola, Peleton, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Victorias Secret, Sony, Viacom, UFC, Starz, Tiffany & Co.,

Hulu, HBO, LA Rams, ABC, Golf Chanel, Warner Brothers, EA Sports, Coach, PGA Tour, Verizon Media,

ESPN, SoFi, CBS News, Peroni, CNN, KRUG, Prime Video, CBS Sports, Pirelli, Belvedere, Venn, St. Ives,

STARZ, ABC, Raiders, Fox, Veuve Cliquot, LACMA, Turner, MlBam, Discovery, Fox Sports, TBS, NFL, NBC

Sports, Paramount, AMC, Cartoon Network, Nickalodean, AT&T, IMAX, Motortrend, FX, Sinclair, Yahoo 

Sports, Sundance, Comedy Central, Sundance, A&E, Ubisoft, Spectrum, Big Ten Network.

This list of blue-chip clients is at the **core of TRKAs success**. These companies represent many things to the company including, but not limited to large budgets to spend on consulting services and the ability to pay their bills in a timely fashion. 

The addition of Redeeem to the TRKA list of capabilities may increase business for the company significantly and quickly. Look at that list of clients and imagine which ones could want to move into crypto currency and block chain transactions.

**The company's operating units are:**

**Redeeem Acquisition** \- An entity created to facilitate the acquisition, just this week, of Redeeem, the crypto/blockchain/NFT company. [Redeeem](https://www.redeeem.com/) is a non-custodial peer-to-peer exchange that lets you buy, sell, and trade fungible goods for bitcoin.

**Troika Services, Inc. (Global)** \- a performance marketing and data intelligence company whose mission is to translate quantifiable metrics into actionable insights and empower businesses to connect with consumers, enhance engagement and optimize brand performance.

**Troika Design Group, Inc. (Los Angeles)** \- a strategic brand consultancy with deep expertise in entertainment, media, sports, and consumer goods and service brands. Troika provides a creative fan-centric approach to integrated brand strategy, creative, research, and technology solutions that builds long-term brand awareness for clients through equity and consumer loyalty.

**MissionCulture LLC (New York) -** Mission-Media Holdings Limited (London) and Mission Media USA Inc. (its non-operating subsidiary) (collectively, known as ‚ÄúMission‚Äù) London-headquartered brand experience and communications companies that specializes in consumer immersion through a cultural lens, via live experiences, brand partnerships, public relations, including social and influencer engagement.

**Troika Labs -** a new division with the primary mission to leverage its expansive data and content creation capabilities to provide a fully integrated digital and creative offering to clients on a global scale.

Robert Machinist, Troika Chairman and CEO said, ‚Äúas consumer media consumption shifts across the various media platforms, marketers require a partner who understands their business, has deep knowledge of the changing environment, and the creative, technology and data services to help them reach their audience.‚Äù

The key to success in that endeavor, is to know who you are creating your content for and that is some of the expertise found at TRKA. The company lists these three areas of expertise available to its clients:

Research and Insights

Branding

Consumer engagement

TRKA has an enviable position in the changing world of media because they understand the changes and other companies are willing to pay them for their expertise. The TRKA emergence as a public company is likely to attract more business from large cap companies who are more comfortable doing business under the transparency offered by listed firms.

Building or strengthening a brand is a big task for any sized company and more and more that involves a presence on all types of media, including social media. Building their brand can be an exhaustive and oftentimes expensive task when attempted in house with employees. And even worse, it can be ineffective.

TRKA has a FYE of June 30th so any accretive value attributable to the Redeeem acquisition may not be immediately apparent. We eagerly await the overall impact on TRKA from the Redeeem acquisition.

460,,2021-05-25 13:42:58,t3_nkq28l,,pennystocks,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of¬† $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers‚Äô minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC‚Äôed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkq28l,GRAMF: Waiting for takeoff?
461,,2021-05-25 13:50:40,t3_nkq83u,,pennystocks,"When you are born, you are born into structure, literal and metaphorical. Your teachers, parents, boss; all teach you STRUCTURE. The difference between this norm you are used to and the MARKET is the market has NO structure.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'ApEs StIcK tOgEtHeR' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq83u,The Difference In A Trading Structure And A Trading System

Worksport's Bed Covers Charge EV Pickup Trucks from Ford, GM, Rivian and Atlis
Mentioned:	AAPL F GM NKLA TSLA WKSP
The first wave of EV pickup trucks is on the horizon and is anticipated to take over the automotive industry in the U.S.

Last week, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) previewed its new electric F-150 Lightning pickup, a relatively inexpensive electric version of the most popular vehicle in America, during a visit by President Biden. Ford had taken 20,000 reservations in less than 12 hours since the truck was officially unveiled.

Other major contenders like GM (NYSE: GM), Rivian, Atlis, Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are also set to release their EV pickup trucks on American roads soon.

Although there are plenty of pros to owning an EV pickup truck, range anxiety is a common concern among many.

To get the maximum EV range possible, the concept of adding solar panels to tonneau covers or truck bed covers seems like the natural next step. But, this hasn't materialized in production yet.

Worksport (OTC: WKSP), a tonneau cover market leader, provides solutions for forthcoming EV pickup trucks with its proprietary technology √¢?? the TerraVis√¢?¬¢ system.

About TerraVis√¢?¬¢ Solar Cover System

The TerraVis solar tonneau cover system consists of four monocrystalline foldable solar panels that have an output of approximately 1kW.

The system should be able to add 12 to 15 miles (20 to 24 km) of range to an electric pickup truck, which is 30% of the power needed for the average daily commute under optimal conditions.

The company has already forged original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supply partnerships with two EV Truck nameplates, one of which is in partnership with Nissan.

The TerraVis system is expected to cost less than 5% of the overall cost of a pickup truck. Furthermore, TerraVis is in development now to give current pickup truck owners access to EV tech without investing in a new truck and to further leverage the power of their electric truck in the future. It is a future-proof product that truck owners will bring as they upgrade and expand with more modular storage.

Not a One-Trick Pony

The TerraVis√¢?¬¢ system's application is not just limited to extending the mileage of EV pickup trucks.

The battery system, Terravis 'Cor' can also be touted as a mobile power plant. The system will take power from the cover and store it in modular battery packs √¢?? storing 1.5kWh of energy in up to four batteries. This can be stored and transported in the truck's bed using the TerraVis√¢?¬¢ mounting system.

The batteries can power almost anything with its built-in 2kWh power inverter from the job site or campsite which can be used in the event of a natural disaster or power outage.

The unique feature of the battery system is that it can be available for purchase as a standalone consumer product √¢?? even if you're not a truck owner.

Massive Potential

Worksport has been around for over a decade and has been successful with its lineup of five unique truck bed cover models. The company has an intellectual property portfolio of over 30 assets of utility patents and trademarks.

The company competes in many multibillion-dollar markets. The EV market is estimated to increase to $30 billion by 2030. This value may be much more than what is estimated with rumors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the bandwagon with its first generation of EVs. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. If the agreement were to take place, we could expect a prototype to be teased in early 2024.

The specialty-equipment market has a market value of over $12 billion as pickups alone account for over 25% of the market. The other big markets include the tonneau cover market ($600 million), the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion in 2020).

With the cumulative size forecasted over $24 billion by 2025, Worksport stands a chance to generate revenue over 1.5 billion, assuming a 5% market share. The company's market stretches beyond just the U.S., into Canada, Latin America, Australia and more.

Worksport currently has over $10 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. In February 2021, the company closed its oversubscribed Reg-A offering, raising $4 million. To date, the company has received over $2.9 million from the exercise of warrants associated with its Reg-A offering and has also raised an additional $3 million from non-brokered Private Placement.

'TerraVis is the culmination of Worksport's effort to look beyond our core business producing the highest quality tonneau covers for all truck owners,' said Steven Rossi, CEO and founder of Worksport. 'We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what a truck accessory can offer, and to do so, we are looking to the future of EV trucks to bring that technology one step closer to today's truck owners. Our solar-powered tonneau cover will allow anyone to generate and store power for use in their daily life √¢?? work and sport.'",nkqdd8,WKSP NEWS 5-25-21

In the following 2 weeks the share price increased from $0.10 to $0.40. Then came the bear market and along with all the other penny stocks SSFT fell back to where it started(at least for me) to $0.10 again.

I accumulated more Sonasoft stocks in both periods, I currently have around 1.2 million shares. The reason that I did that was not to make a quick profit, it was simply investing in my future. I'm too busy to follow the markets everyday and do day trading. And with my past experience I saw that swing trading a discounted penny stock is much more profitable then taking risks every day.

**Last week two important things happened.**

**1- Annual financials are released**

**2- Investors meeting took place.**

These two events strengthened my confidence in my choice of investment. We are clearly in on a company that's destined to become a Nasdaq star.

Before we start with financials, let me explain what this company is all about.

SSFT used to be a data management company in Silicon Valley serving global clients for about 20 years. Company shifted it's focus from Data Management to an AI first solutions company in the early 2019 and went on with acquiring 3 AI companies and talents.

Their newly created AI platform Saibre (former NuGene) is currently used as a POC (Proof of Concept) product although even at this stage it started generating revenues.

Company's AI department annual revenue increased 15x (to 780k) YoY.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abjpi1fgm9171.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d092b078dd01efe7f5b2ae71268003d61d0a18a

Despite 2020 being a catastrophic year for many companies, Sonasoft managed to compete with previous year's revenue.

2020 total revenue has reached **$8,935,27**1 with an additional **$3,702,000** deferred revenue that is not added into 2020's numbers because the service in return has not been completed yet.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qek8u3y6o9171.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=535ff55e720db96182be7e16f0e7e6cd5ede3e00

So even in the worst year where companies cut their costs drastically Sonasoft managed to reach **over 10 million USD in revenues**. This also happened when they were building up their AI platform to become market ready. **The AI bots that's already contributing to the revenue will be bringing in full recurring revenues when they are 100% ready before the end of Q3 this year.**

Besides promising numbers everyone was curious about hearing about the new direction from the current management. Back in March, a couple of us reached the company and asked for a better PR channel and transparency. Company responded immediately and for the first time they organized an Investor's meeting with all of the top officials.

I'll share two short videos with CFO Rob Baumert and CEO Mike Khanna answering questions from investors.

# Sonasoft CFO Rob Baumert explaining AI company valuations

https://reddit.com/link/nkqueb/video/wddgstujo9171/player

To reiterate, the company valuations are typically 20x-100x in AI industry.At $0.10 share price and about $50 million market cap with about $10million revenues Sonasoft is a massively discounted AI company at this stage. That is mostly because their flagship product is not on the market yet and they are still a OTCQB company.

&#x200B;

# ""What is the revenue potential of Saibre AI?"" Sonasoft CEO answers.

https://reddit.com/link/nkqueb/video/jfz4wyybp9171/player

Sonasoft signed a revenue share agreement with Fidelity National (FIS) back in 2020. According to Mike each bot will bring in at least 180k upto 500k and more and with partnerships like FIS they will be reaching thousands of clients who will be creating multiple bots. **The recurring revenues that he's talking about is not per company, it's per bot!**

# Nasdaq listing

Almost all the penny stocks promise to be on Nasdaq or higher level markets one day, but maybe less than 10% of those really become one. This wasn't something that I'd take serious unless there were some solid steps towards that direction and the CEO announced a new addition to the team, Paul Schlosberg. I'm not sure if he will be an advisor or a board member but something sticks out in his Resume ""**He enjoyed over 10 years as a member of The NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Committee in Washington**""

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/)

If the requirements haven't changed $3 minimum share price is required to uplist. So there you go, people who ask what's the price target for this; the first PT is $3 and I think this will happen earliest  between Dec 2021 and Aug 2022. Given that they hired this person for it. All the other requirements are already met for Nasdaq.

They also gave a detailed demonstration of their SAIBRE platform. I'm a UI designer and from my point of view they created a product that's really well thought, easy to use and efficient.

Here are some screenshots of SAIBRE where they were creating new bots to go through and learn from massive data sets, only in minutes.

**Here are some highlights from the meeting**

* AI platform patent application submitted at the end of 2020 .
* Replacement of Nugene with Saibre.
* NuGene reached limits, not enterprise scale. It was not built with easy of use which is a huge differential. Container model was causing hesitations with clients.
* Saibre in contrast is easy to use, scalable, efficient. Anybody can use Saibre, there's no tech leakage, customers can deploy a new bot with a single click.
* Company did an internal audit for engineering and sales.
* Developed agile approach to respond customer needs efficiently.
* OEM partners, last few months, ramped up work.
* Before the end of q3 bots will be ready.

**Rob Baumert CFO:**

* Big book of sonasoft is written.
* Significant changes to financial structure.
* Impact of discountinued operations. Econnect and Sonavault were loss makers and not part of AI. They were a drag. So they let them go. Cost savings are much more.  Now more focus on AI success.
* They looked at spending during 2020 reduced costs greatly during this period. Monthly cash burn is half now.
* 2021 coming with growth and recovery.
* Core team is strengthened.
* Increased AI expenses, FIS parnership strengthened. AI segment rev increased 15x.
* Secured their financial runway with funding.

**Max Lee Head of AI :**

* Saibre is a complete AI bot solution.
* We're on the shoulders of giants. Learned from previous systems.
* Nugene was a jack of all trades.  But required manpower and scaling was hard. Custom coding was a problem.
* Took the best parts and built Saibre.
* This AI is getting built to challenge all AI projects. Thousands of images are required to separate a dog picture from a cat picture for an AI. All need to be labeled and requires a lot of data. Other models requires vast amounts of data. If the data is noisy or mislabeled system can't learn.
* Current SSFT IP is like a young child. You give a child one example and the kid learns from a single experience.
* Kid understands that its a ball even if he partially sees the ball. The new IP is working similar to that.
* Future algorithms will take advantage of this basis.
* Max is also getting inspiration from biology and neurology.
* Less time to deploy with less resources

**Caroline Zaborowski - VP of Data Science:**

* All AI systems need datascientists. And Datascientists need efficient, easy to use and flexible systems
* Current systems are time consuming. Saibre is reducing time to value.
* They redesigned the workflow, less time is spent on data cleaning, reusing the components and more collab between data scientists which is really important.
* Can be used by experienced data scientist and a regular user.
* SSFT AI solution is far more adoptable by clients.

So there's still a lot to talk and tell about Sonasoft. The story is long.

The future of this company have 2 possible directions in my view.

1- Will become a one stop platform for AI solutions that all size of enterprises can use. AI is not for the most sophisticated or the most wealth and big anymore. They are bringing it to the masses.They will be listed in Nasdaq and keep on growing from there into a multi-billion dollar company.

2- As soon as they are listed on Nasdaq, with a working product and massive potential they will be acquired by giants.

If you are ready to invest for your future with optimum risk/reward, SSFT share price has found it's bottom at $0.10, has been here for a while but not for so long. Buy it and HODL guys.

**My first target is above $5 but I wont be selling it all at that level. We're only at the beginning.**

Good luck!",nkqueb,Highlights from $SSFT investors meeting and valuation comments from management. Silicon Valley AI company.

OCUP has had 4 evaluations by analysts in 2021, so these are recent, and all have given it a target price above 20. That would multiply the current price by roughly five. An any time we can have an investment multiply that way, it's worth looking into it.

So before anyone claims I'm a pumper: this is a super small clinical stage pharma (not a pennystock though) with a small pipeline running mostly on one product/idea, at least in the near future. It's a risky investment. Do your own D/D. Also, tomorrow they are hosting a webinar, so you can listen firsthand and form an opinion. 

Now for the D/D. Why are all analysts so optimistic about OCUP?

Well, anyone that has ever gone to the ophthalmologist to have their eyes/eyesight examined, will understand this one.

When we go to the eye dr., we are given eyedrops to enlarge our pupil. The black part of the eye. The black part of the eye, is like a hole. So the larger the hole, the better look the doctor can have into our eye. This is a VERY simplified explanation.

It takes at least 25 minutes for our pupil to dilate. After the exam, (anyone who has experienced it knows this), it takes a few hours for it to get back to normal. During those hours, we can't see well, our vision is blurred, we can't read a book, watch a screen or drive a car.

Some of us just take a bus home and wait it out. But for many of us, that time with blurred vision means we are going to miss more hours of work. That recovery time is worth money.

Well, currently there is no solution for this situation. You go to the eye doctor, your pupil is dilated, then you waist several hours after the visit waiting for your eyesight to recover.

OCUP have developed the eyedrops antidote. Very simple: eyedrops you receive at the end of the visit, which will bring your sight back to normal within roughly the same time frame it took for the pupil to dilate (about 20-25 minutes).

What this means is, anyone, worldwide, that goes to consult with an ophthalmologist, everyday, any day, that's the market for this product. 100 million visits pe year in the USA alone. And there is no alternative. They will OWN that market. Just imagine this: a product that every eye dr. around the world will have that will drastically improve the patient's experience by simply receiving some eyedrops that bring the eyesight to normal. You can go back to work, use the computer, drive etc.

That alone, is a good enough reason for betting on OCUP. That's worth billions. But it actually gets way better for four reasons:

1. This product has other uses, we are not going to get into all of them because they refer to more specific eye issues.
2. They are in Phase three, using a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
3. There is an additional HUGE use for this product.
4. The current market cap is very very low.

What the 505 pathway basically means is that the active ingredient, the main ingredient of this new product has already received FDA approval, twice. So what OCUP does is use the data that already exists about this compound to avoid a lengthy approval path. In other words: it makes the approval of the product way faster. And after 7 very successful trials involving over 200 patients, they are in the last stages of moving towards an approval request (which, as explained, can be obtained much faster). So we are talking about approved product this year.

As for the other huge market for OCUP. OCUP is using the same technology they developed to apply it, with slight changes of course, to different situations. One such situation is presbyopia. Don't let the name scare you, it's very simple: the need for reading glasses. Pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age needs reading glasses. It's part of the process of getting old. Almost 2 billion people worldwide suffer from it. That's how big the market is.

OCUP are again, creating something that doesn't really exist: eyedrops that will ""cure"" or delay presbyopia. Basically they can avoid, if not totally then partially, the need for reading glasses, simply by using eyedrops. A huge market, also with no real competitors.

There is more to write about OCUP and it's small but amazing pipeline. But just these things I mention is the reason I personally loved this find. I'm slowly increasing my position and waiting. It's a long position. It's not a company that creates huge news. So this is about buying cheap now and waiting. If the analysts are roughly right, we can quadruple our investment within 12 months. I'll take it.",nkrbpf,Why do Analysts give OCUP a 20 plus Target Price ? (currently at 4.30)

Both phases will be completed in the second half of this year. Market Cap 90M, addressable market 1B+. It's \`metal as fuck\`.

Having said all this, I am not a financial professional, and there are risks associated with the stock obviously.

**Problem:**

Antimicrobial resistance is a rapidly growing problem. It's estimated that 1 million people die because of AMR, and considering the pace, it can grow to 10 million by 2050. Health system is getting pretty desperate, because while bacteria are getting better at resistance, the system is running out of effective ammo. New / novel ways of treatment are urgently needed.

**Entasis Therapeutics:**

It is an AstraZeneca spin off, founded by scientists and executives from the company.

Background of the CEO Manos Perros:

‚ÄúPrior to this, Dr. Perros worked for AstraZeneca AB as vice president and head of its infection research and early development organization from 2010 to 2015 and as site head for its research center in Waltham, Massachusetts from 2012 to 2015. Prior to joining AstraZeneca, Dr. Perros served as director of the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases in Singapore, and prior to that, as vice-president and chief scientific officer, antivirals, at Pfizer, Inc. A chemist by training, Dr. Perros conducted his Ph.D. work in Belgium, France and Germany, and was an associate in the Biophysics department at Yale from 1993 to 1995. Dr. Perros received the PhRMA Discoverer‚Äôs Award in 2010.‚Äù

**Products**:

The company directly focuses on AMR. Has two products in late phase 3, which were due early- mid 2021 but got delayed because of COVID. The results are expected to come out H2 of 2021. Basically both catalysts are within a few months.

It works by interfering with an enzyme called [topoisomerase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyP0cEbqKTc), which plays a crucial role in keeping a cell's DNA from getting all twisted up like an old-fashioned curly phone cord. When things start getting too tightly wound, topoisomerase cuts the DNA strand, unwinds it, and reattaches it with a bit more slack. Topoisomerase inhibitors bind to the topoisomerase and stop it from doing its job, causing the bacteria to essentially shred its own genome; one source we talked to called this ‚Äúmetal as f\*#$.‚Äù

The description is very important for 2 reasons: because it is a novel drug its cross resistance is super low, meaning if the bacteria is resistant to another drug, the possibility of it being resistant to Z is very low. Also because it can serve as a treatment for other illnesses as well. The article below has a pretty long list of other bacteria in its \`activity against other bacterial species\` list.

[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00021](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00021)

Important to note that the drug‚Äôs efficacy was 96% in phase 2. (the main treatment had 100% in a small sample) But because of  the rising resistance, they think that Z will be used as a supporting medicine against resistant strains.

## sulbactam-durlobactam for Super acinetobacter

**Acinetobacter baumannii** can **cause** infections in the blood, urinary tract, and lungs (pneumonia), or in wounds in other parts of the body. Basically a general asshole that casues different shit in the body. ‚ÄúMultidrug-**resistant Acinetobacter baumannii** is recognized to be among the most difficult antimicrobial-**resistant** gram-negative bacilli to control and treat.‚Äù

In vitro Trials:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516359/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516359/)

Method: ‚ÄúIsolates were obtained from various body sites from patients in 37 countries and from six world regions between 2012 and 2016. Identification of carbapenem resistance mechanisms and assignment to A. baumannii clonal lineages was based on WGS.‚Äù

Conclusion:  Sulbactam/durlobactam had excellent in vitro potency against A. baumannii isolates, including those that were resistant to imipenem/meropenem, amikacin, minocycline and colistin, compared with other compounds. Sulbactam/durlobactam has the potential to become a useful addition to the limited armamentarium of drugs that can be used to treat this problem pathogen.

486,,2021-05-25 20:03:30,t3_nkypih,,pennystocks," **ZGS** is a nanomaterials company which found its new beginnings 3 years ago as a business through science oriented board and continues to make progress towards feasible applications for Graphene which they source from their own Albany Graphite resource in ON.

The current board members of ZEN were voted in by investors 3 years ago. **What have they achieved so far?**

**5 IP of note undergoing testing or underway at this time.**

**Antiviral/Antibiotic/Antifungal ZENGuard ‚Ñ¢:**

Has strong purported reliability against drug-resistant disease**^((1))**. Functionality presents itself in the form of coatings for PPE in partnership with TreborRx of masks, mask filters and nitrile gloves. Phase 1 human trial testing of similar compound for pharmaceutical use case may begin sometime in the fall**^((2))****.** Through NucroTechnics they have confirmed that exposure of their compound does not lead to any irritation or sensitivity**^((3))**. Minimum concentration < 1¬µg/ml to achieve 99.9% effectiveness.

**Graphene-Enhanced Concrete:**

40% higher compressive and flexural strength at a 0.02% concentration of graphene, 84% at a 0.04% concentration**^((4))**.

**Graphene-Carbon Aerogel Batteries:**

Very exciting results through the German Aerospace Centre. 2 wt.% loading of graphene dispersed in aerogel and resulted in an initial specific discharge capacity of 2800 mAh/g and a discharge capacity of 1300 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current capacity of 186 mA/g^(()**^(5))**. A podcast**^((6))**(Nov '19) with Francis Dube suggests further developments on this technology should see light within the next year (at the time it was suggested a 2 year minimum).

**Dehumidification Membranes:**

Through a partnership with Evercloak. Increases power efficiency of HVAC systems by \~75%**^((7))**.

**Corrosion Protection Coatings:**

Testing shows improved wear resistance, extend engine life, increase fuel efficiency, and increased engine power in vehicles. Epoxy corrosion-inhibiting coating for steel showed minimal corrosion (3% of surface) after 10 days when exposed to highly corrosive saline solution. Two-year project studying graphene as a corrosion protective coating for steel**^((8))**.

**Maths! Earnings!** Numbers provided on ZENS' Investor presentation, **I'm filling the gaps**.

[Margin estimates of masks from SI user Garth https:\/\/www.siliconinvestor.com\/profile.aspx?userid=9151157](https://preview.redd.it/afewrvezlb171.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07d4fff41c2f308208337a71c2771f651c5cf8c)

Coating volume once ramped up (currently pilot stage) will be \~800million coated units per month \~2.4 billion per quarter. Earnings per unit provides **$0.03-$0.06** cents per unit giving **$2.19-$4.38 EPS** for 99,000,000 diluted shares with 24% corporate tax rate. This provides fair **2-3 year** **SP range of $30-$60** at full production capacity (upper end wont occur until we collapse our cost structure to enhance the unit margins).

Glove coatings at **$0.01-$0.04** per unit would add around **+$0.30-$1.20 EPS**, HVAC filters with coating at **$1.00-$4.00** per unit would provide **+$0.08-$0.30 EPS**. This adds onto the **max** 2-3 year SP range by **$5-$18 result in $35 - $70** on earnings from combined PPE & HVAC market penetration. We are currently expected to be at 32 million coatings per month by end of June. That is an annual rate of 384 million disregarding the ramping-up, providing **by June a floor EPS \~0.11 Justifying minimum of $4** if current extrinsic share price is allotted. November is when full production is expected. At least a full year or two will be required to prove earnings, stabilizing intrinsic share price.

A similar material to ZENGuard**‚Ñ¢** is being tested toward therapeutic usage**^((9))** within the human body. Therapeutic would disrupt portions of a massive industry so it's hard to take into account. We will see resistance from this sector, so do not expect this to happen quietly or easily. Controversy is likely if this portion is a success. This is where the true speculative value of ZGS will be. If they can pull off ZENGuard‚Ñ¢ they can redouble toward therapeutic and disrupt sectors of pharmaceuticals that have poor adaptability.

https://preview.redd.it/zc4o6922mb171.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=0069efc597b477278a30461a2d9fc64d558ec783

It kills superbugs, partially solving a present and future problem. Bacteria/viruses/fungi can't really adapt out of silver. It destroys the cells by lysis, so, if adopted, we may not see the problem we've seen caused by the overuse of antibiotics. Human/animal cells have more and thicker membranes, protecting them from lytic destruction. DNA I'm not too sure the effects toward, but should be minimal if any. Testing will confirm and is ongoing. 

**Great!.. What are we waiting for?**

A health advisory**^((10))** published April 2nd by Health Canada brought to light a series of unwarranted masks which were introduced into the markets late last spring, as to take advantage of the Covid-19 virus without safety testing or certification. These masks allegedly contained Graphene, causing a obvious holdup for our graphene-based coating for masks. Further info has been sent to HC and secondary testing is now underway & awaiting results.

https://preview.redd.it/ovc4sqk2mb171.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe3ff335b4c989d99ee79d6a0c06d3ad769a348

The major problem thus far with graphene markets, isn't about creating the tech, it has been about showing and exposing people to how effective small amounts of graphene are in improving already existing products. It's been shown that Graphene is a great additive for many applications, and provides **large efficiency bonuses from small % addition**, but many IP needs introduction to market or to create the markets. ZEN has done very well with getting reach arounds from companies; Board has alluded to other PPE + Filtration manufacturers expressing interest so keep posted. TreborRx has an **LOI** agreement to collaborate on a minimum 100,000,000 masks so it is not an expressly permanent agreement by any means.

They are sitting on $4mil cash from previous offering. Cash burn of \~1.5mil per quarter while setting up production infrastructure. Either **expect success out of ZENGuard‚Ñ¢** or **be ready for a little more dilution/warrants**.

**ZEN is on ISED of Government Canada! Test their material if you work for the government!**

**Evercloaks' membrane/filter samples are available for testing through ISED**

Government website for test of 3d-printed membrane is the same as above.

**3 YEAR ANNIVERSARY FOR CURRENT ZEN BOARD!**

Executive Chairman Francis Dub√© on Twitter:

**Closing Statements & Comments:**

Some may be worried ZENGuard ‚Ñ¢ is only a good product for corona but this is a product with no competition, it is an application to already existing product. Better masks would only benefit everyone in the future IMO.

This could be the beginning of something great, don't get too caught up in day-day movements, this could easily take months to move significantly so if you don't have patience this company might not be the right pick. Much news to come! Patience is key if you know what's coming.

Thank you for your time when reading and taking this innovative company into consideration. Evercloak and TreborRx, the partners of ZEN will provide great stories for scientific progress through future as well.

**Cheers to the future!**

Saw a few posts about this stock and I think tons of people are missing out. The need for security right now is obviously lower with COVID restricting large gatherings but as the world slowly opens up again, I think we could start to see Liberty Defense's tech everywhere.

Liberty Defense, while still currently in development, is working towards creating high-tech security solutions that use AI and 3D imaging. They are working out of Canada but they have distribution plans to go worldwide. The main thing that is going to attract investors to Liberty is its security system known as HEXWAVE.

HEXWAVE security barriers can be installed at points of entry at several venues, whether it be sporting events, TSA checkpoints, schools, or many other applications. As people walk through the gates, the 3D imaging tech is able to identify both metal and non-metal weapons. Then, the AI uses a threat-level system to determine the risk of the item and if anything is considered dangerous, an individual can be flagged to then be further searched or apprehended. The speed at which this system works is boggling with a throughput of 1000 people an hour. I'm imagining how much time can be saved and how many long lines can be avoided if these things were implemented.

HEX WAVE is currently in Beta and is being tested by the groups and organizations below. If testing goes well they, are planning their launch in 2022 and I think they could see some huge revenue. Besides HEXWAVE, their other two big-time projects are High Definition - Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) and their Shoe Scanner. Both of these projects have received support and funding from the American Department of Homeland Security and planned to be implemented by the TSA. This tech works similarly by using imaging tech to identify foreign objects on an individual without the need for the removal of coats, jackets, or shoes.

At an entry point of $0.47, I really don't see a reason why not to get in on Liberty Defense, even if just for a small investment to hold. When public venues open up even further and these guys being to roll out their amazing line of security devices, their potential revenue could be staggering.

Since announcing the invitation just this morning, the registration rate has been even bigger than anticipated.

""We're taking our time in the launch of our Vaycaychella App to make sure everyone that signs up gets the support they need,"" said CEO William ""Bill"" Justice. ""We invested in having good online support available to users before we launched the App and now we're registering everyone first with our online support before they log on to the App for the first time. Our support team will be available online every step of the way.""

Vaycaychella allows anyone and everyone access to purchasing a short-term rental vacation property that can be listed on Airbnb, VRBO and Booking.com.

The Vaycaychella App lets buyers create a profile to present their own talent and experience in addition to presenting the potential of the property to generate income.

Anyone can register as an investor - individuals or institutions. Registered investors can view details on the prospective short-term vacation rental properties and the individuals behind the vacation rental businesses that will be running the property.

Registered investors should check back frequently. The App is just getting started, giving Rentrepreneurs time to post their projects. Keep coming back and seeing what's new and find the one that's right for you.

The Vaycaychella App can help entrepreneurs finance property purchases in California and Florida, for example, as well as financing property purchases in Cuba and Kenya. Vaycaychella is particularly enthusiastic about bringing P2P finance to the world's developing economic regions.

Vaycaychella believes its long-term success will be closely aligned with the opportunity to connect social responsibility and vacation fun and the ability to profit by becoming a vacation property owner or a P2P investor empowering the vacation property owner in both the developed and developing world economies.

The $1.6 trillion global travel industry is one of the largest and fastest growing business sectors.

The Vaycaychella App is a product of WSGF's subsidiary, also called Vaycaychella.

WSGF acquired Vaycaychella last year and made Vaycaychella its primary business focus. WSGF is in the process of changing its name to reflect the new business focus.

Vaycaychella, prior to being acquired by WSGF, built a pilot alternative finance business for short-term rental vacation properties backing a portfolio of beach rentals in the Caribbean. Vaycaychella built a portfolio valued at $1.2 million.

Some quick info...This company holds an international patent for processing oil sands.  What does this mean?  There are over 300 billion barrels of oil in the sands of Canada alone (remember this patent is for Russia, USA, and Canada). Typically the process involves an immense amount of environmental damage that leaves behind tailing ponds of contaminated water/sand/chemicals. Petroteq have developed and patented a process wherein they are able to draw up to **95% of the oil out of the sand**, while recovering 99.99% of the solvent used to do so **without leaving behind any waste water**.  This means that they are able to extract almost 15% more oil from oil sands than traditional methods, and the sand comes out clean and ready to be sold as a separate commodity.  It is truly revolutionary and I can see why big oil players would want to get their hands on this patent.  Below is a picture of said patent.

In the oil world patents are one of the only things that protect small companies from being swallowed up by the larger players.  If the larger players cant build around the patent to make something equally as disturbing in the market they will either initiate a hostile takeover or a buyout in order to acquire the technology.

Today more than twenty investors holding more than 1 million shares got in contact with Uppgard in regards to the offer and all of them received the same response.  Uppgard is acting on behalf of an un named third party that is offering to buy 200 million shares (1 million share blocks minimum) at the price of .59 cents which is almost 10x from the current price and well over 10x from when I posted yesterday. As someone noted in the comments of my post yesterday ""That's an offer for over 75% of the free float or nearly 50% of the total shares outstanding"".  Take from this information what you will, but it seems like this offer is finding more and more legitimacy as the days go on and there is either a buy out from a big player or a hostile take over coming.  Some of $PQEFF's largest investors were approached directly about their shares, and many long term investors are planning to hold this with a PT of $3-$4.

494,,2021-05-26 02:20:37,t3_nl63hf,,pennystocks,"Hello everyone. As we all know China is extremely populated and they definitely lover their bikes. They are much more affordable than cars. They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO‚Äôed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶which is 100% growth again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I believe that estimate is light!

You may have heard of $CTXR on this sub with people saying that they're releasing Phase 3 results (interim) any day now for their Mino-Lok, a medication meant to salvage catheters. So how did Citius end up receiving this award at a cell and gene therapy annual meeting?

Citius has many products in their pipeline, including this iMSC drug/therapy that is meant to repair pulmonary tissue as a cause of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) from COVID-19. 

What the fuck is iMSC and why should I care about it? MSC's are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells found in your bone marrow, umbilical cord cells, molar cells or amniotic fluid that are extracted and used to repair other tissues. The problem with these, as you can clearly tell, is that they have to be extracted in a limited fashion.

> Our next generation ‚Äúinduced‚Äù mesenchymal stem-cell (i-MSC) therapy is derived from an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) bank. Previous research shows that MSCs produce potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodality properties that help counter the cytokine storm that brings about ARDS. MSCs also restore endothelial and epithelial barrier integrity, enhance the clearing of fluid from the lungs, and may exhibit antimicrobial properties.

Hold on. What's iPSC? 

>iPSC are derived from skin or blood cells that have been reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state that enables the development of an unlimited source of any type of human cell needed for therapeutic purposes. 

Holy moly. I'm saying they received the best poster award because they've shown, in pre-clinical stages, that they can safely repair pulmonary tissue with this novel technology, without the limitations of MSC - iMSC have an unlimited source.

**TL;DR**: MSCs have shown effectiveness in treating inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is of growing concern in the light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. ARDS is characterized by extensive inflammation in the lungs, causing severe shortness of breath. MSCs sourced from bone marrow, umbilical cord tissue, and adipose tissue are all being considered as possible therapies to treat ARDS. However, the ability to scale-up MSC manufacturing to meet the needs of the current crisis remains an open challenge. MSCs derived from iPSCs (iMSCs) offer a near limitless supply of cell due to their superior expansion potential.

**Ok, so, I was asked to explain the pipeline of BNTC.**

Please note, I don't know this company, **I don't have a position**, have not verified their financial situation, partnerships, stock valuation, etc. All I am doing, per request of a fellow reddit, is to explain the pipeline in terms that are easy to understand so that people might have a better idea what they would be buying into.

This company is developing what they call ""a combination of gene therapy and RNA interference‚Äù, (gene silencing). Before we explain this, we should focus on a few basic things.

**First this is an IND**. It's an investigational new drug. This obviously means, and BNTC is very clear about it,  that they are developing a new technology that hasn't been used, and more importantly, approved before. 

The positive side of this is, that if it is approved, it has no competitors, and as we will see, huge potential. The negative side is, it will take several years to get approved, and the FDA is very careful about approving something completely new, obviously.

**Another important factor**: so far these products are in the preclinical/non-clinical stage. This means  everything done until now has been tested in a laboratory setting (for example in tissues, or in animals). **Nothing has been tested on humans**.  

As an investor, it is important to note two things:

1. The company has yet to make any plans/requests for a clinical trial. So we are talking about approval several years from now.

2. Potential drugs and treatments become promising or irrelevant mostly during clinical trials.. So it's a big risk.

**As for the technology, put into simple words**: Let‚Äôs try

Their main product is BB301. Their other product, BB103 (they could have chosen less confusing numbers IMO) is more of the same: they are testing the core technology.

BB301 is being developed to treat Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). What you need to know about it: it's very rare, and it is caused by a malfunctioning gene.

So, if bb301 eventually is approved, this is NOT what BNTC is building on. That in itself is a small market. But, it would mean the TECHNOLOGY works, and then applying it to many, many other situations caused by gene mutations, etc, is where the money is at. Potentially, a lot of money. 

**So what BNTC is doing?** When a gene malfunctions, like in OPMD or when a virus reactivates like in Hepatitis B (the target of their other product) essentially **a gene is producing a protein that is harmful**. **The objective is to neutralize, or silence, or knockdown the gene**. Basically, not allow it to work.

To do that, the therapies target RNA, a molecule that has many functions, among which, to carry ""information"" needed to produce the protein.

By silencing the mRNA (the messenger RNA, the one sending messages) the malfunctioning gene can no longer produce the bad protein.  **BNTC claims that other companies are using the following method:**

They introduce into the patient a synthetic RNA (made in a laboratory)  that is built in such a way that our body will cut it in half. One half then, feeling lonely so to speak, will bond with that messenger we want to stop from sending messages to produce the bad protein. That will effectively stop the mRNA and that will ""knockdown"" the gene.

**BTNC has a better idea:** instead of having to constantly introduce synthetic RNA (which is like needing to take medicine all the time), they introduce a DNA construct that keeps producing the RNA needed to silence the bad gene.

**A DNA construct is basically a DNA made in a lab**. Don't confuse it with what people call ""my DNA"". Our ""DNA"" is actually a genome, like a sequence made from many DNA-like molecules. Like a chain of DNA's if you will. So the DNA will not interfere with ‚Äúour DNA‚Äù.

**The benefit of BTNC's method** would be that once the DNA construct is introduced, it produces the RNA forever, solving the problem with one therapeutic intervention. It's like taking one pill, and solving a problem that today can't really be solved and requires taking medicine daily. It's also better than the system being developed by rivals (that also doesn't exist yet) that requires introducing the RNA time and time again.

**So, how great is this and should you invest in BTNC?** From a scientific standpoint today, a problem even greater than developing these products, something that is already pretty advanced, is actually ‚Äúsending‚Äù them to where they need to go in our body. The delivery system. That has been very challenging and so far no one has a clear solution for this.  BTNC claims the use of a DNA construct simplifies the delivery. They could use delivery systems similar to those employed to deliver, for example, some of the covid vaccines being used today.  I don't see that. I don't think they have that technology figured out yet for the use BTNC intends. That's why their explanation isn't too specific. 

The other issue is that it remains to be seen what that DNA construct will do inside the patient‚Äôs body. Remember, it will be ‚Äúproducing‚Äù an RNA endlessly. Yes, that RNA might help block the bad gene. But it might also interfere with genes and production of proteins we badly need. Since it will be in the body forever, and can‚Äôt be taken out (it‚Äôs not like a device, it becomes ‚Äúpart‚Äù of the patient) the FDA has already made it clear that it doesn‚Äôt feel too great about DNA constructs. It's not an easy approval.

**Bottom line**. You might be investing in a company that is ‚Äúbuilding a new internet‚Äù. A company that is in the forefront of technology that will revolutionize the world as we know it. At least in terms of health, longevity and medicine. That‚Äôs exciting. It‚Äôs coming, it will happen eventually. 

On the other hand, the product is a very very long way from being ready and hasn‚Äôt been tested in humans. It‚Äôs a very long play and many things might go wrong along the way. I don‚Äôt think anyone could expect any truly meaningful news in the next couple of years, at least, in terms of pure science.",nldgdx,D/D on BNTC pipeline per request

* Announced enrollment has commenced and three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed in the first Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020 intestinal alkaline phosphatase (""IAP"") intended to support development of SYN-020 in multiple indications
* Announced enrollment has commenced and the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (""HCT"") recipients
* Current cash position of approximately $76.9 million
* Received $8.0 million from the exercise of warrants
* Current cash runway provides funding into 2023 and ability to fund Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 as well as SYN-020 intestinal alkaline phosphatase (""IAP"") through proof-of-concept

**Upcoming milestones, pandemic conditions permitting:**

* Topline data from the Phase 1a single-ascending-dose (""SAD"") study of SYN-020 anticipated during **Q3 2021**
* Expect to commence second Phase 1a multiple-ascending-dose (""MAD"") study of SYN-020 during **Q3 2021**; topline data anticipated during **Q2 2022**
* Topline data readout from the first antibiotic cohort of the SYN-004 Phase1b/2a clinical trial is expected during **Q4 2021**

""During the first quarter of 2021 we remained **diligently focused** on advancing our portfolio of GI and microbiome-focused clinical programs and were pleased to announce the commencement of clinical trials for our SYN-004 and SYN-020 programs,"" said Steven A. Shallcross, Chief Executive Officer of Synthetic Biologics. ""Enrollment in the SYN-004 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients is underway at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (""Washington University"") and the first patient of the first antibiotic cohort was dosed earlier this year. We believe SYN-004 has the potential to address an important and underserved patient population, and may significantly improve outcomes for allogeneic HCT recipients by preventing downstream complications often associated with disruption of the gut microbiome by intravenous (""IV"") beta-lactam antibiotics. If enrollment proceeds as planned, we anticipate announcing topline data from the first antibiotic cohort during the **fourth quarter of 2021**, pandemic conditions permitting.""

Mr. Shallcross continued, ""We were also very excited to announce the initiation of a Phase 1a single-ascending-dose clinical trial of our SYN-020 IAP program during the first quarter of 2021. To date, three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed and we remain on track to report topline data from this study during the third quarter of 2021, pandemic conditions permitting. A second Phase 1a multiple-ascending-dose study is also expected to begin enrollment during the third quarter of 2021 with topline data expected early next year. Both studies are designed to support the advancement of SYN-020 in multiple potential therapeutic indications, including celiac disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (""NAFLD"") and age-related metabolic and inflammatory diseases. We are very excited about the potential for this program to be a long-term value driver for our Company and look forward to sharing important updates.""

Mr. Shallcross concluded, ""While we remain focused on the execution of our clinical development activities, we were also able raise net proceeds of approximately $66 million as well as $8.0 million in proceeds from the cash exercise of warrants, significantly strengthening our balance sheet and financial position. As a result of these activities, our current cash position is approximately $76.9 million. Importantly, our fortified balance sheet will fully fund our SYN-004 and SYN-020 clinical programs through proof-of-concept clinical studies, and help accelerate our other ongoing activities.""

**Clinical Development and Operational Update**

* Announced Washington University has begun enrollment and the first patient was dosed in the first antibiotic cohort of the Company's Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD)
* Announced enrollment has commenced and three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed in a Phase 1a SAD clinical trial of SYN-020 in healthy adult volunteers
* Strengthened balance sheet by raising net proceeds of $66 million from the sale of common stock via the Company's At-The-Market (""ATM"") facility and $8.0 million resulting from the cash exercise of a portion of Company's 2018 warrants during Q1 2021

**Quarter Ended** **March 31, 2020** **Financial Results**

General and administrative expenses increased by 2% to approximately $1.42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $1.39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to higher insurance costs, audit fees, and legal costs offset by a reduction in patent related legal fees, consulting fees and travel expense. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $82,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $65,000 the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Research and development expenses decreased by 32% to approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily the result of lower indirect program costs for the three months ended March 31, 2021, including salary and related expense reductions, a decrease in manufacturing costs for SYN-020 and market research. In addition, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's development partner (Washington University) reduced their operating capacity during 2021 to include only essential activities as part of their pandemic response, which delayed the start of the Company's clinical trial, resulting in lower clinical trial expenses for the quarter. The research and development costs incurred during the quarter were primarily related to the Company's Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients. The Company anticipates research and development expense to increase as ongoing clinical trials continue to enroll patients. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $19,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $18,000 related to stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Other income was $347 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to other income of $38,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 is primarily comprised of interest income.

Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021 totaled $76.9 million, an increase of $70.7 million from December 31, 2020.

Creative Medical Technology Holdings $CELZ is a company I encourage everyone to look into. Co-founded by Dr. Amit Patel, the inventor of Jadicell, Dr. Tom Ichim and Tim Warbington, the company is engaged in stem cell research to treat common abundant diseases that impact the world's population.

The company has filed an IND application with the FDA on its newest technology, ImmCelz, for the treatment of stroke. After back and forth Q&A, the FDA has provided constructive feedback for the IND on May 14th, which the company is now working on to submit to the FDA for this first of its kind technology, and then will await approval to begin clinical trials. 
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-responds-to-creative-medical-technology-holdings-regarding-its-immcelz-ind-for-stroke-treatment-301291533.html 

ImmCelz is set to revolutionize the treatment of far-reaching, common diseases such as stroke, liver failure, kidney failure, heart attack, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, transplant rejection and Parkinson's disease with positive preclinical for each. The invention of Dr. Amit Patel and Dr. Thomas Ichim, ImmCelz treatment involves utilization of allogenic Jadicell stem cells outside of the body to ""reprogram"" the patient's own immune cells so as to endow upon the immune cells regenerative activities. The company believes that ""educated"" immune cells may be superior to stem cells because of their: a) ability to replicate and form ""memory"" cells; b) substantially smaller size, which allows for superior biodistribution than stem cells; and c) adeptness at surviving in conditions such as hypoxia or acidosis, which would inactivate stem cells. Preclinical trials have shown an 85% increased improvement with ImmCelz versus the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of stroke. 

Once FDA approval is received to begin clinical trials for the treatment of stroke, the company intends to file other IND applications for ImmCelz based on positive preclinical results in treating the common diseases mentioned earlier. Annually, these are all multi-billion dollar areas. The ability to provide a non-pharma, one-time procedure for those affected by these diseases is a game changer.

The company has recently brought on renowned kidney specialist, Dr. Caigan Du, and clinical trial expert, Dr.¬†Boris Reznik, to its scientific advisory board. This week it announced that Dr. Manillo Ricordi, world renowned clinician and scientist at the University of Miami and Diabetes Research Institute has joined the team. Dr. Ricordi called the company's ImmCelz technology a ""first-in-class approach to leveraging the immune system to act in a regenerative manner to treat a wide variety of indications including diabetes, liver failure, heart failure, and stroke.""

The mean pain changed from 8.9 at baseline to 4.3 at 30 days and sustained to 1.8 at 6 months and 1.3 at 12 months with a gradual reduction in overall pain medication utilization guided by their healthcare team. This data shows the potential this one-time treatment offers those suffering from degenerative disc disease.

TORONTO and KNOXVILLE, Tenn., May 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Solar Alliance Energy Inc. (‚ÄòSolar Alliance‚Äô or the ‚ÄòCompany‚Äô) (TSX-V: SOLR)** is pleased to announce it has signed a binding Letter of Intent (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with Abundant Solar Power Inc. (‚ÄúAbundant‚Äù) to build, own and operate a 350 kilowatt (‚ÄúkW‚Äù) solar project in New York State (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù).  


The construction-ready Project is permitted and is supported by a 30 year power purchase agreement. This Project will be the first solar project in the Company‚Äôs portfolio of operating solar assets and will generate a recurring revenue stream over its 30 year life.

‚ÄúThis project in New York State represents a significant catalyst for Solar Alliance and clearly outlines the potential for strong growth we see in our ability to build, own and operate assets in the US market‚Äù said Solar Alliance CEO Myke Clark. ‚ÄúThis project is ready to build and is backed by a 30 year power purchase agreement that will provide a recurring revenue stream to Solar Alliance. Abundant is a respected developer of solar projects and we are confident we can build on our relationship in order to access a larger pipeline of solar projects that we can develop, own and operate.‚Äù

Solar Alliance anticipates signing an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (‚ÄúEPC‚Äù) contract with Abundant. Construction on the Project is expected to commence this summer and is anticipated to be in operation by the end of 2021.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to be working with Solar Alliance on this project and see the potential for an expanded relationship moving forward,‚Äù said Abundant‚Äôs CEO Richard Lu. ‚ÄúAbundant Solar has an extensive pipeline of solar projects in development and we see strong syngergies between our two teams. We will be working diligently with Solar Alliance to complete this project on time and on budget this year.‚Äù

The net capital cost for the project is expected to be approximately US$525,000 and will be financed by Solar Alliance either through equity or a combination of debt and equity. As part of the Company‚Äôs expansion strategy, Solar Alliance is also assessing opportunities to acquire or partner on earlier stage develop projects that would eventually be built, owned and operated by the Company. This complements Solar Alliance‚Äôs growing business of designing, engineering and installation solar systems for third party owners.

‚ÄúSolar Alliance has made the strategic decision to pursue growing, near term revenue opportunities in addition to building, owning and operating our own solar projects. This allows us to generate revenue to support our operations while we grow our portfolio of assets under ownership, concluded Clark.

Myke Clark, CEO

Funding from Australian Government, Peer-Reviewed research from University of Queensland, FORBES.COM ARTICLE [https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/05/13/ev-range-breakthrough-as-new-aluminum-ion-battery-charges-60-times-faster-than-lithium-ion/?sh=17fe8676d287](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/05/13/ev-range-breakthrough-as-new-aluminum-ion-battery-charges-60-times-faster-than-lithium-ion/?sh=17fe8676d287)

Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) is an Australian based company that specializes in the production and sale of graphene enhanced products. Traditionally cost prohibitive and difficult to produce high quality Graphene, GMG‚Äôs proprietary production method using Natural Gas (Methane) instead of Graphite allows for high quality, inexpensive graphene to be produced.  This allows GMG to pivot towards fast-charging Aluminum-Ion battery prototyping/production as their primary products.

&#x200B;

ALUMINUM-ION BATTERIES AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Aluminum-Ion Batteries are a newer type of battery currently being researched and tested by a number of organizations, including University of Queensland (UQ) and Stanford University, and have shown increasing promise as an alternative to Lithium-ion batteries. The additional benefit of using little-to-no heavy metals (i.e. Lithium, Cobalt, etc.) makes this a super attractive formulation.

One of the limiting factors has been the graphite/graphene (depending on prototype tested) used in the battery. While I‚Äôm not going to deep dive into the ins and outs of graphene production, traditional methods producing graphene from Graphite are expensive and difficult to obtain a high-quality plane structure. This is where GMG comes in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The University of Queensland, in their Aussie government funded research into Aluminum-Ion batteries, went with GMG to supply their graphene and found they were able to achieve fantastic results. GMG‚Äôs high quality graphene plane structure produced from natural gas instead of graphite allowed for a breakthrough in the amount of aluminum atoms that could be ‚Äúinserted‚Äù inside of the graphene planes (layers) to produce high density electrodes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

THE RESULT OF THIS?

A high-density battery that acts practically like a super capacitor. **Charges times up to 60x-70x faster and capacity comparable to traditional lithium-ion batteries WITHOUT EXHIBITING HEAT ISSUES THAT WOULD CAUSE A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY TO EXPLODE TRYING TO CHARGE THIS FAST**. Numbers like these might sound too good to be true, but this is peer reviewed research by the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland. And Graphene Manufacturing Group has exclusive access to this battery formulation through their research and commercialization agreement with the University of Queensland and Uniquest (UQ's commercialization company) because they supplied the Graphene free of charge.

&#x200B;

ENERGY DENSITY

Below is a chart of the current Aluminum-Ion technologies being tested.

[\*Lithium Ion: Energy Density \~100-265 Wh\/kg, Power Density \~250 ‚Äì 340 W\/kg  \(Source: See links at end of page\)\*](https://preview.redd.it/sbsaun2ddh171.jpg?width=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23d77989abc17d4d72c87ea88c697acfd37078e1)

&#x200B;

>‚ÄùGMG Managing Director Craig Nicol insisted that while his company‚Äôs cells were not the only graphene aluminum-ion cells under development, they were easily the strongest, most reliable and fastest charging.  
>  
>‚ÄúIt charges so fast it‚Äôs basically a super capacitor,‚Äù Nicol claimed. ‚ÄúIt charges a coin cell in less than 10 seconds.‚Äù

&#x200B;

MULTIPLE OBVIOUS USES FOR BATTERIES LIKE THIS

* Cars ‚Äì Fully charge a car in 10-20 minutes
* Cell phones ‚Äì Fully charge a cell phone in 1-5 minutes
* Laptops
* Coin Cells (watch batteries) ‚Äì Fully charge in 10 seconds
* Powerwalls
* etc

&#x200B;

PROS

* Much faster charge times
* Little to no Heat buildup
   * Safer charging and at faster rates
   * Weight reduction in batteries (less cooling and thermal management circuitry)
* Reduce dependence on China for rare earth heavy metals
* Materials are highly recyclable and easy to obtain
* Cycle lifespan up to 3x longer than traditional Li-ion
* Can fit into same housings and operate at the same voltages as Li-Ion

&#x200B;

>‚ÄúSo far there are no temperature problems. Twenty percent of a lithium-ion battery pack (in a vehicle) is to do with cooling them. There is a very high chance that we won‚Äôt need that cooling or heating at all,‚Äù Nicol claimed. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt need circuits for cooling or heating, which currently accounts for about 80kg in a 100kWh pack.‚Äù

&#x200B;

CONS AND OTHER NOTABLES

I will always be the first one to talk about potential caveats and downsides:

* Graphene is traditionally expensive - GMG‚Äôs method claims that it is much cheaper to produce than traditional methods, but final figures are still yet to be known.  Current prices from other producers are around $100/gram, but this figure is for typical graphene production methods using mined graphite. GMG has plans to ramp up production so pricing models are yet to be known. I was unable to find how much graphene is required per kg of battery, likely proprietary info right now.
* Infrastructure ‚Äì If charge times truly are this fast, our electric grid simply cannot handle large batteries charging this quickly.
   * However there are proposed workarounds for this. For example, I have seen suggestions of charging an Aluminum-ion powerwall to full capacity at a slower rate and then using said powerwall to fast-charge an EV separate from the grid.
* This is still in early prototyping right now but the research and production methods are sound. GMG is a smaller company and it will take time to ramp up graphene production and develop new products.

&#x200B;

GMG‚ÄôS PLAN MOVING FORWARD

Graphene Manufacturing Group currently has research and commercialization agreements with the University of Queensland and Uniquest and has begun the prototyping stage:

>‚ÄúUnder the agreement, GMG will manufacture commercial battery prototypes for watches, phones, laptops, electric vehicles and grid storage with technology developed at the University of Queensland (‚ÄúUQ‚Äù). GMG has also signed a license agreement with Uniquest, the University of Queensland's commercialization company, which provides GMG exclusive license of the technology for battery cathodes.‚Äù

Currently, their revenue is pretty small from their traditional graphene products they sell, but they have made it clear that they are pivoting to batteries this year. GMG is starting with coin cell batteries by the end of 2021 and are aiming to work their way up to automotive style batteries estimated around 2024. Currently they hope to run with the technology and vertically integrate it themselves instead of licensing the technology. However, they have stated this is not set in stone and potential partnerships with phone / automotive companies could be an option.

GMG recently went public and trades as $GMG.V / $GMGMF

Warning - new CEO sucks a bit as a salesman, Just be patient till he warms up. This is a very smart technical guy with clear strategic vision: exploring training market, making smaller more affordable home versions. This is great!

Particularly, the agreement with CoolerMaster (Taiwanese CPU cooler manufacturer. Check out their products...) to produce gaming equipment, and AudioKinetic (which controls 65% gaming audio market) agreement for game developers to be able to produce D-BOX haptic content. This is the right direction - game & movie people should have access to this. Remember before Apple start to be winning market share? They had to get APP developers (tools, conferences, etc) first.

This is a smart CEO talking about top notch strategy. Now it's a matter of execution. Go D-BOX!

**And the rest**

Full disclosure: I bought a sizable amount of DBO shares recently (Feb 2021). Prior to the investment, I was looking around for information about its business, but all I could find was the financial statement (up to Dec 2020, their financial Q3) and some high level description with logs of graphics on its ‚Äúabout us‚Äù page. From these, I didn‚Äôt find much positive information about its outlook:

**Leadership changes**

S√©bastien Mailhot as the new President and CEO since Apr 1, 2020. In Feb, there were two new appointments to the Board of Directors.

**Some Financials**

The company was on a good trajectory at end of 2019. Pandemic changed a lot of things since.

4.8 mln in cash at end of 2020, burning at \~3.7 mln per year (2020). It did secure a 4mln loan from National Bank in 2020 and used it to repay long term debt immediately.

Compared to 2019 (19mln), the 2020 9 month revenue number (8.1 mln) isn‚Äôt that bad, all things considered.

On Feb 17, company announced overnight marketed equity offering at C$0.13. Even the over-allotment was fully exercised. Company raised C$5.75 mln.

**Product**

Its biggest revenue comes from the ‚Äútheatre seats that move‚Äù. Depending on the film, feedbacks are mixed. There are a lot of theatres (720 screens in 40 countries) with D-BOX seats. On May 26 Cinemark signed deal to get 8 additional screens equipped (total 99). DBOX gets a cut from the ticket sales.

Its commercial entertainment & simulation products enjoy favorable comments from multiple gaming product reviewers and are considered the go-to for the best seats and cockpits for game/racing simulation. There‚Äôs no problem with performance of their products ‚Äì they rock. Price point is quite high and not a lot of people have the space and budget for one.

The announcement in Sep 2020 of partnership with Jaymar to produce D-BOX seats for the home. This ‚Äúhome‚Äù version is definitely the right direction to get into living rooms. A $3699 US price tag is not a cheap one, but much easier to consider than their pricy race simulation products.

**Thoughts**

Countries will be coming out of pandemic and resuming activities within a few more quarters. People will look for experiences that they have been deprived of. A good immersive experience at theatres, or a similar experience at home are going to make some good money. D-BOX is in a position to benefit from both.",nlmavr,"D-BOX $DBO.TO (ASK @ C$0.105): a mini DD, no DCF"
512,,2021-05-26 17:33:45,t3_nlmn2v,,pennystocks,"Hey guys - back with some DD on a new company (thanks to some players on the CSE forum) I've been following for the past few months - **BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO ($CRFT).** The company was previously Pasha Brands, which was a trash pump and dump designed for an acquisition in 2019 (which fell through), and now they're rebuilding with some pretty amazing assets in hand. Take a look. **Full disclosure: I bought $5200 at 3.5c and 4c because I think it's going to rip. Already up 12.5% today.**

**SUMMARY:**

There have been a bunch of companies that were raided by corporate pirates and robbed of the opportunity to win in the Canadian cannabis market in 2018/2019. We know the story - corporate and IR teams come in, do a pump and dump with existing assets and try to make an acquisition play. That‚Äôs what happened with CRFT. Their old CEO, Patrick Brauckmann did a P/D post IPO. Got it up to very high levels (didn‚Äôt raise at these levels) but rather sold off stock and the company crashed.

These guys are undergoing a re-org to re-position themselves away from Pasha Brands with a legitimate business model. 

**MY RATIONALE:**

&#x200B;

* First off, there's **massive      IR exposure** and a great story to tell to the markets ‚Äì this will move      the needle even before sales volumes as it's such a good story. They just      acquired AVA Pathways, a mushrooms research company to add that to the      investor story to play with $TRIP $MMED $CYBN and $CMPS.
* The company is broken out      into 3 different decisions, **with serious assets in play**
   * Cannabis in Canada (BC       Craft Supply, Meddcann Health Products)
   * Cannabis in the USA (Feel       well Brands)
   * Psychedelics in Canada (AVA       Pathways) markets.
* They have licenses and      facilities ‚Äì ASSETS at the end of the day. Things that can be sold if      needed. They're currently doing a $2m renovation on their facility in      Chemainus, and that's only 1/4 assets, and the stock market cap is only      $6M. **So undervalued right now.**
* **Redemption story** ‚Äì CEO Matt Watters      (previously CBD Therapeutics) coming back on board to right the ship. CFO      Regan McGrath is also very bright. The management team looks solid and I      vetted the major players with my network. Checks out.
* **Social cause** ‚Äì BC Craft is a gateway for      black market growers to get back into legal cannabis. There‚Äôs a lot here      that nobody is talking about with regards to bridging the gap for the      legacy market. Bringing the black market and making them be able to      compete with the regular market is a huge advantage and will rally a lot      of social support behind the company.
* **Proven access to funding** ‚Äì they just did a raise ‚Äì      deep connections to industry.
* **Stock at all-time lows ($0.045)** ‚Äì trading under asset value      given what they've paid.
* **Insider filings show all      insiders with options and warrants at +10c. Many at 12c/20c/28c**. They have an incentive to      build the stock from these levels ‚Äì 4/5c is extremely low in my opinion.      All of my plays are like this ‚Äì undervalued companies trying to get back      on track.
* Already successfully      launched Grizzlers pre-rolls into multiple markets with Alberta already      live, and Ontario, Quebec orders confirmed.
* They have licenses and      facilities ‚Äì ASSETS at the end of the day. Things that can be sold if      needed. They're currently doing a $2m renovation on their facility in      Chemainus, and that's only 1/4 assets, and the stock market cap is only      $6M. **So undervalued right now.**

**Take a look at these guys - with a new team, a new board, and a new name - I honestly think this is a MAJOR opportunity, especially as the USA legalizes. Canada cannabis, USA cannabis and CBD, and Canada psychedelics. CRFT has it all!!**",nlmn2v,TAKE A LOOK AT BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO ($CRFT)

I can tell you from multiple experiences that no matter how perfectly you prepare, there will always be something unexpected which will force you to adjust plans, adapt, and overcome. This is what separates successful businesses from failing ones. 

On the OTC, especially pinks, you invest in speculation and potential of deals/plans/contracts etc etc. I brought you information BEFORE the big spike in price happens, should FOMO Corp succeed in executing their plans. The 4MM funding was the last piece necessary before this current deal closes.

Float means actual shares being traded, and not in some long term hold with company insiders or institutional investors. As that daily volume goes down, the price will keep going up and up and up. It will not take long until they would have to start buying at 1 dollar, 2 dollar, 10 dollars, etc. (share price being mostly a function of supply and demand)

Mr. Li Cheng, CEO of IINX, said, ""The most prominent technical feature of the product is that the battery has super fast charging and discharging ability, and the battery can be fully charged as short as 12 minutes, which greatly saves charging time, this fast charging technology is at leading level of the industry in the world. Meanwhile, compared to nowadays mainstream lithium-ion batteries, the new aluminum ion battery does not overheat during the charging process and has better safety performance. Additionally, it also has the characteristics of broad adaptability in high and low temperature environment and lower manufacturing cost, which will bring greater advantages in the application field. We believe that the development of this new battery product with superior performance will bring great value to the company and its shareholders, and will become a new growth point for the company to increase profits.""",nlq40g,10min charging Alumion-Ion Fast Charging invented by a 16mill cap stock.

I just sold after it made its run, and now I‚Äôve decided to move all in on a Junior Mining Company, New Jersey Mining Company based out of Idaho in the Murray‚Äôs Gold Belt.  To my surprise there‚Äôs not really a dedicated subreddit for junior mining companies, so here‚Äôs hoping to get a little discussion going here perhaps. 

I‚Äôve made this move for two reasons. First, resource mining has always performed well during inflationary periods, so I figured why not? Secondly, I‚Äôve just found I enjoy speculating on JMCs rather than anything else I‚Äôve tried. I consider myself an avid rabbit-holer and I enjoy deep dives into companies fundamentals, and I mean deeeep. Like actually reading the 10-k/10-q filings. I do so to hedge against my anxiety that comes from speculating on such companies in the first place lol.

ANY INFORMATION POSTED HEREIN SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INVESTMENT ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

Now for some major points of my DD that brought me to the New Jersey Mining Company (NJMC):
  
‚Ä¢ First, I have to admit I clicked on this company at first solely because of their name (I am from the dirty Jerz myself call it tribal, or stupid idrc)
 
‚Ä¢ Secondly, It owns 100% interest in the Golden Chest Mine that consists of 25 patented mining claims covering an area of 280 acres and 90 unpatented claims mine covering an area of 1,390 acres. The mine is in production and they have their own mill to process the ore.

https://newjerseymining.com/production/

  ‚Ä¢ This map of the gold belt shows their unpatented as well as patented lands, and they even receive royalties from sections of Hecla‚Äôs Silver mines. 

https://newjerseymining.com/murray-gold-belt-map/

  ‚Ä¢ The management team has extensive knowledge and experience in each of their respective fields, and I am extremely confident in their plan of action.

https://newjerseymining.com/the-team/

‚Ä¢ In recent news they just discovered a significant gold-quartz vein within one of their patented lands. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-mining-co-discovers-significant-123000589.html

‚Ä¢  They also had a favorable Q1 of 2021 where revenue increased however gross profit was down due to a rare high wind storm power outage and equipment repairs which were delayed due to shipping delays of replacement parts. They made significant advances in drilling and ore tonnage.  I believe that despite the loss they will come through strong in the subsequent quarters.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-mining-company-provides-first-130000187.html

‚Ä¢ Also as of two days ago, NJMC hit a double gold vein in their Paymaster shoot. Which reinforces their plan to drill deeper.

(((selling price) \* \~75% ownership ) - \~10% Closing Costs) / shares

140k acres is a lot, so it'll probably be somewhat difficult to move all of them together, so they might take a price lower than 40k.  So, let's just assume 10k/acre for a lowball estimate.  Also, there is no tax on the on the sale, since it's university lands (don't ask me, it's just what I've read).

(140k \* 10k) = 1.4B

1.4B \* .75 = 1.05B

1.05B - 105M = 945M

945M / 144M Shares = **\~$6.50/share dividend**.

With recharge speeds like this you don't need more energy density for cars, todays challenge is actually mainly cost of battery and lack of infrastructure.. but the infrastructure WILL be massively improved over the next 5-10 years.
This is an interesting alternative to the solid-state lithium-battery race that is currently going on. However, it won't be able to compete for capacity and solid-state WILL be able to recharge faster than todays batteries, though maybe not THIS fast.
It will all come down to costs probably, but it is way too early to speculate on costs as both alternatives are still in development.

‚ÄúRemote Health Clinics (RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) were on the front lines during the pandemic, providing COVID testing, treatment, and more recently serving as COVID vaccination sites for local communities‚Äù, said Dr. Lisa Crossley, CEO of Reliq Health Technologies. ‚ÄúThere are over 4,500 RHCs and FQHCs across the US. Remote Health Clinics provide primary care services to Medicare patients in rural and underserved or ‚Äúshortage‚Äù areas. Federally Qualified Health Centers provide both primary care and dental care services to rural, urban and shortage areas. After pausing onboarding at our RHC and FQHC client sites at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, we are now pleased to announce that onboarding has resumed with these clients. We expect to onboard over 27,000 RHC and FQHC patients over the next 12 months. These healthcare organizations will be using Reliq‚Äôs Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), Chronic Care Management (CCM), Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) and Transitional Care Management services to help improve patient health outcomes and enhance access to care. We expect to generate an average revenue of $50 USD per patient per month with these clinics.‚Äù

Additional News**:**  


**Adding FHIR capabilities gives the company a key competitive advantage in the community healthcare market. As national managed care plans, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage programs rush to comply with the new CMS regulations to be enforced starting July 1st, Reliq is uniquely positioned to help these large-scale enterprises satisfy the new interoperability requirements.**  


**Reliq Health Technologies, Inc. Announces Implementation of FHIR Standard for Interoperability to Address New CMS Regulations, Hires New Chief Technology & Innovation Officer**

**HAMILTON, ON, April 28, 2021 / - Reliq Health Technologies Inc. (TSXV:RHT or OTC:RQHTF or WKN:A2AJTB)** (‚Äú**Reliq**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù), a rapidly growing global telemedicine company that develops innovative Virtual Care solutions for the multi-billion dollar Healthcare market, today announced that it has adopted the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for its iUGO Care platform to meet the needs of large-scale enterprise clients such as managed care plans and other payers, who must comply with new CMS regulations for interoperability.

‚ÄúIncorporating the FHIR standard into our platform allows Reliq to offer current and prospective clients cutting edge interoperability capabilities‚Äù said Dr. Lisa Crossley, CEO of Reliq Health Technologies, Inc. ‚ÄúIn December 2020 the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule, which would require CMS-regulated payers to adopt the FHIR standard. ¬†FHIR is essentially a standardized framework for healthcare data exchange which CMS has adopted in order to improve communication between diverse healthcare information systems, and to streamline Prior Authorization processes to ensure in advance that patients are eligible (and providers will therefore be reimbursed) for any services to be provided. This proposed rule builds on the existing CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, which will be enforced by CMS as of July 1, 2021. Under these new interoperability standards, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) managed plans, State Medicaid and Qualified Health Plans (QHP) are required to use the FHIR standard to enable seamless data exchange between providers, payers and patients. Our new patient portal leverages the FHIR standard to provide patients on the iUGO Care platform with secure, seamless access to their healthcare data in accordance with the new regulations. Implementing FHIR significantly expands the Company‚Äôs total addressable market, allowing Reliq to work directly with large-scale enterprise clients such as managed care plans, private insurers and other payers as well as healthcare providers.‚Äù

The Company also announced that it has hired Dave McKay in the newly created position of Chief Technology & Innovation Officer. Mr. McKay has over 30 years of experience in Software Development and brings significant expertise in healthcare technology, cybersecurity, privacy and product innovation to Reliq. His experience in developing enterprise-level solutions for the healthcare market will be invaluable to the Company as it executes on its strategy to rapidly scale its business over the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company would also like to announce that it has eliminated the positions of Chief Technology Officer and Chief Innovation Officer, previously held by Rob Prouse and Bassma Ghali, respectively, and wishes to thank both Mr. Prouse and Dr. Ghali for their contributions to date. Mr. McKay will assume the responsibilities previously associated with these two roles.

Lizhi has some fascinating technicals, trading at around 5.30 in August of last year, the stock continued to dip to lows of 2.28 until October, where it suddenly spiked to 4.75 before closing the day at 3.15.

This pattern repeated, spiking from 2.36 to 5.91 in December, before closing the day at 4.79, bleeding down to 3.35.

1st of Feb 2021 is where things went wild, with the stock soaring up from 3.30 to an ATH of 16.75.

Over the next month, they plummeted to 6.75, before spiking up to 15 again and then DOWN DOWN DOWN all the way to 4.23.

Today they spiked from 4.34 to a high of 8 before emptying out to 6.84 at close.

This company has had consistently negative earnings, negative EPS, negative EBITDA.  A market cap of 342M with an EV of -147.6M.

665,,2021-05-26 23:20:00,t3_nlu9di,,pennystocks,"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today‚Äôs price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today‚Äôs price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

Worksport's Bed Covers Charge EV Pickup Trucks from Ford, GM, Rivian and Atlis
Mentioned:	AAPL F GM NKLA TSLA WKSP
The first wave of EV pickup trucks is on the horizon and is anticipated to take over the automotive industry in the U.S.

Last week, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) previewed its new electric F-150 Lightning pickup, a relatively inexpensive electric version of the most popular vehicle in America, during a visit by President Biden. Ford had taken 20,000 reservations in less than 12 hours since the truck was officially unveiled.

Other major contenders like GM (NYSE: GM), Rivian, Atlis, Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are also set to release their EV pickup trucks on American roads soon.

Although there are plenty of pros to owning an EV pickup truck, range anxiety is a common concern among many.

To get the maximum EV range possible, the concept of adding solar panels to tonneau covers or truck bed covers seems like the natural next step. But, this hasn't materialized in production yet.

See also: How to Buy Ford Stock

Worksport (OTC: WKSP), a tonneau cover market leader, provides solutions for forthcoming EV pickup trucks with its proprietary technology √¢¬Ä¬î the TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ system.

About TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ Solar Cover System

The TerraVis solar tonneau cover system consists of four monocrystalline foldable solar panels that have an output of approximately 1kW.

The system should be able to add 12 to 15 miles (20 to 24 km) of range to an electric pickup truck, which is 30% of the power needed for the average daily commute under optimal conditions.

The company has already forged original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supply partnerships with two EV Truck nameplates, one of which is in partnership with Nissan.

The TerraVis system is expected to cost less than 5% of the overall cost of a pickup truck. Furthermore, TerraVis is in development now to give current pickup truck owners access to EV tech without investing in a new truck and to further leverage the power of their electric truck in the future. It is a future-proof product that truck owners will bring as they upgrade and expand with more modular storage.

Not a One-Trick Pony

The TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ system's application is not just limited to extending the mileage of EV pickup trucks.

The battery system, Terravis 'Cor' can also be touted as a mobile power plant. The system will take power from the cover and store it in modular battery packs √¢¬Ä¬î storing 1.5kWh of energy in up to four batteries. This can be stored and transported in the truck's bed using the TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ mounting system.

The batteries can power almost anything with its built-in 2kWh power inverter from the job site or campsite which can be used in the event of a natural disaster or power outage.

The unique feature of the battery system is that it can be available for purchase as a standalone consumer product √¢¬Ä¬î even if you're not a truck owner.

Massive Potential

Worksport has been around for over a decade and has been successful with its lineup of five unique truck bed cover models. The company has an intellectual property portfolio of over 30 assets of utility patents and trademarks.

The company competes in many multibillion-dollar markets. The EV market is estimated to increase to $30 billion by 2030. This value may be much more than what is estimated with rumors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the bandwagon with its first generation of EVs. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. If the agreement were to take place, we could expect a prototype to be teased in early 2024.

The specialty-equipment market has a market value of over $12 billion as pickups alone account for over 25% of the market. The other big markets include the tonneau cover market ($600 million), the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion in 2020).

With the cumulative size forecasted over $24 billion by 2025, Worksport stands a chance to generate revenue over 1.5 billion, assuming a 5% market share. The company's market stretches beyond just the U.S., into Canada, Latin America, Australia and more.

Worksport currently has over $10 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. In February 2021, the company closed its oversubscribed Reg-A offering, raising $4 million. To date, the company has received over $2.9 million from the exercise of warrants associated with its Reg-A offering and has also raised an additional $3 million from non-brokered Private Placement.

'TerraVis is the culmination of Worksport's effort to look beyond our core business producing the highest quality tonneau covers for all truck owners,' said Steven Rossi, CEO and founder of Worksport. 'We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what a truck accessory can offer, and to do so, we are looking to the future of EV trucks to bring that technology one step closer to today's truck owners. Our solar-powered tonneau cover will allow anyone to generate and store power for use in their daily life √¢¬Ä¬î work and sport.'

It seems that pennystocks and OTCs in particular, fundemental DD seems to resolve around, company dropping fins and working on current status followed by shareholder letter or some big announcement, or other news like mergers, custos, reinstatements, etc... 

Basically it seems that DD for OTCs is more short term and riding the hype and not something like ""hey this 5B outstanding shares company has a cool concept and good growth potential for next 5 years"" so its tough for me to value it long term.

I am curious how to value these things short term? Like if I catch an unknown company today that's likely going to reverse merger and I know which company it will reverse into then I would be all over it cos I know no matter what it will explode when rest of traders catch on and so I wouldn't know how to value it but I would just be guessing that hype will run up like we seen with GGII, TSNP etc...

Second, how do you DD these OTCs? They don't produce books for how to do this haha, their are some twitter people that do have courses like @KickoStocks and @ShortSqueezed1 who have courses on OTC trading just not sure I am willing to pay for this stuff...

780,,2021-05-24 14:13:35,t3_njyxbk,,pennystocks,"CAPEX Concerns were raised after my original Due Diligence posts on **$PBT** by a few contributors in pennystocks. After originally creating a comment I realized that this comment needed to be its own post since there are a lot of factors to consider. My first 2 posts assume that we are entering a super cycle of commodities and as of Q1 2021 this has been proven by the price of WTI Crude Oil and new worldwide consumption. 

**TLDR Shortcut:** The thesis remains that markets are forward looking at oil price rise above $70 is a technical break indicator with price discovery that we have not seen in over a decade(Summer 2008). The market's bullishness towards commodities recently are reflective of inflation and oil prices specifically are on a major run as COVID exposure worldwide is decreasing. Price target remains of $17-22 through Aug.

Increased drilling costs on the Waddell Ranch properties resulting in a deficiency for the NPI. Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the first quarter of 2021 totaled $9.5. At first glance this seems like an issue but US Shale are tight plays that require consistent drilling and fracking which was not done during the decline on 2016-2020 on the Permian Basin properties. The cumulative NPI deficit is **$7,645,016** for the underlying property (at 75%). The NPI deficit must be recovered from future proceeds of the Waddell Ranch properties prior to any other proceeds being paid to the Trust. Total Oil proceeds for Waddell reached **$12,245,665** for the first quarter of 2021. We have a current amount of unknowns such as new well production but we can make certain assumptions based on the knowledge of shale Oil that new wells have a higher production value and older wells have a declining production value. With the addition of the new wells we should see a large jump in oil production from both properties and we already have an increase in oil prices that are at a price target of $65 which is 11% higher than previous year.

Blackbeard has previously informed the Trustee that the 2021 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $88.6 million (gross) ($32.5 million net to the Trust) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The Trustee has been advised that there were **27 workover wells completed, 8 new wells completed, 8 new wells in progress and 9 workover wells in progress during the three months ended March 31, 2021**. The Waddell Ranch is being targeted for production because of the mass amount of oil rich acreage, pipeline placement, and service company ease of access to keep costs down. Texas Royalty Properties is the only producing acreage for Q1 towards the dividend but will have a declining production value while Waddell Ranch should have a massive increase in production value based on the current drilling activity. Unlike certain areas, the Permian Basin has highly proven well production based on exploration technology where all drills are producing wells thanks to fracturing technology. Also the cost of well service companies are still contributing to a lower cost to produce if you follow major service companies like baker Hughes, Halliburton, Fractech, ect..

At the end of Q1 the average per day output production was:

**Oil** 2,379 on an average price of $58.13(**Current WTI price $64.46**)

**Gas** 10,313 with an average price of $1.60(**Current Gas price $2.90**)

&#x200B;

The net profits/overriding royalty interest in the Waddell Ranch properties is the largest asset of the Trust. The mineral interests in the Waddell Ranch, from which such net royalty interests are carved, vary from 37.5% (Trust net interest) to 50% (Trust net interest) in 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres. A majority of the proved reserves are attributable to six fields: Dune, Sand Hills (Judkins), Sand Hills (McKnight), Sand Hills (Tubb), University-Waddell (Devonian) and Waddell. At December 31, 2020, the Waddell Ranch properties contained 648 gross (221 net) productive oil wells, 109 gross (39 net) productive gas wells and 209 gross (67 net) injection wells. Six major fields on the Waddell Ranch properties account for more than 80% of the total production. In the six fields, there are 12 producing zones ranging in depth from 2,800 to 10,600 feet

**Directly from PBT 10-K**

>The Waddell Ranch properties are mature producing properties, and all of the major oil fields are currently being **waterflooded** for the purpose of **facilitating enhanced recovery.** Proved reserves and estimated future net revenues attributable to the properties are included in the reserve reports summarized below.

Estimated quantities of proved developed reserves of oil and gas as of the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands): 

https://preview.redd.it/smt6yvlgp2171.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e49591410caf24941f74df9984b1549b3ad2515

Average oil and gas prices of $65.56 per barrel and $3.11 per Mcf were used to determine the estimated future net revenues from the Waddell Ranch properties and the Texas Royalty properties, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The question raised by my previous posts is if we enter a commodities super cycle will the price of oil exceed $70 and if it does what is the underlying price of **$PBT** represented. An average price of $70 with a proven production value, not factoring in new drilling, **adds an additional $19.75M($4.44/barrel\*4450k)**. If oil prices enter a more bullish cycle similar to 2008 with reopening being complete and a roaring 20s style spending happens for the next Quarter, we could potentially see an average Oil price of $85 for a short period of time in July/Aug which is my targeted timeline and **adds an additional $86.5M($19.75/barrel \*4450k)**.  

The volume of daily shares has been suppressed for a  year which is the average shown but historically was much higher, which leads me to believe we are still early for the upside. For  example in 2008 when oil went on a large run the daily volume reached  +3M at one point. When price for oil is high and the dividend is fully  restored the average volume was around 400k/day and spikes of +1M with a  trading price of $17-22 or $6.8-8.8M/day.

If you refer to my original post, a good portion of shares are institutional or wrapped in a 1031 through a corporation. I learned  about the 1031 connection through some business associates I have in the  Permian Basin that have done this when selling their real estate and  parking the capital during down turns. I believe this will help keep a  large portion of shares locked up as the price rises since a 1031 is a  process and usually a planned event.",njyxbk,CAPEX update on $PBT expanding on previous DD (PT $17-22)

The company has 65 million cash on hand and currently sits at a market cap of 80 million, and will be presenting for the first time human phase 1b/2 clinical data on NT219 on 6/4 at the ASCO conference. For now, the presentation will only include monotherapy and combination therapy with cetuximab, but with preclinical humanized mouse data that looks like this: 

https://preview.redd.it/m8swwrp853171.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&s=9950b44d2116f92d04729e869033c04951b88869

And having the drug already cleared as safe in humans via phase 1a, it's a fairly safe bet that the results are going to be pretty good - the above data represents results for human tumors implanted into mice. As it stands NT219 seems to have strong synergistic effects with almost any drug its paired with as it prevents drug-tumor resistance, and is a small molecule that can cross the blood brain barrier, allowing it to potentially be a part of combination therapies for traditionally hard to treat cancers as well, such as neck and brain cancer. Additionally, the lead researcher behind NT219 trials recently got an award from the American Association for Cancer Research roughly a month ago. 

&#x200B;

Technicals: The price currently sits at a price of 4.54 and has a RSI of 60.5, so it may be good to wait for a slightly better entry point - I could see a dip of going to the 4.20s in the next two weeks, but I doubt it will get back to the 3.80s with the upcoming catalyst. The company has an extremely tight share structure of 17.5m and an average float of 300,000, so if it moves it will move fast, likely a single day breakout of over 100% as seen with tickers like SYSX. IMO the smart play here is to open up a small entry position and buy as the dips come, or at the breakout past key resistance at $5.00. Since fundamentally the cash value on hand of the company is around 60m, or \~$3.80 per share, even if everything goes poorly the play has a downside of \~20%. If this starts ripping there will likely be a sell off at \~7 to get in if you're late to the party, but short term price targets of $25 (500m market cap) are fairly realistic given they potentially have IP of a highly versatile best-in-class drug that addresses unmet market needs (head and neck cancer). As a long hold, if this gets past Phase 3 this is easily a $100+ stock (2b market cap). As it stands right now, the value of the drug seems ridiculously undervalued and unpriced in, and once topline data for p1b/2 gets released a major risk factor will be removed for more investors to jump in.

Doubleview Gold Corp. is a Canadian resource exploration and development company located in Vancouver British Columbia. Doubleview is publicly traded on the TSX-Venture Exchange [TSX-V: DBG], [OTC: DBLVF],  [GER: A1W038]. Doubleview identifies, acquires, and finances quality base metal exploration mining projects in North America and more specifically British Columbia, Canada. Doubleview increases shareholder value through strategic and quality Gold, Copper, and Silver projects acquisitions, and through the state of the art exploration methods in the industry.

Doubleview endeavours to increase the odds of exploration success and to mitigate investment risk through diversification. Doubleview‚Äôs announcement of the Gold Rich Porphyry Copper Discovery on its Hat project in Northwestern British Columbia sparked interest in the Company and this part of the famous Golden Triangle. Doubleview continues aggressive exploration on its Hat Project and plans to advance its other projects in 2021

So as mentioned in the title, there is major news upcoming with the resumption of drilling on the ‚ÄúHat project‚Äù. The Tahltan Nation, an indigenous tribe in British Columbia, has ordered the mining to be halted due to interfering with the boundary‚Äôs of the tribes land. Now as of right now there leads to be no proof of when the drilling will continue, but I‚Äôm very bullish on this stock in the coming weeks as they have been drilling here for over 7 years, and have been making consistent deals with the tribe along the way.
.. If you ask me, I think the tribe is attempting to make a deal with Doubleview Gold. 

My current entry points are anything below .70 

And my price targets are:

The news of the company begining work programs on their gold projects at this time is very welcome news as the company is flirting with all time highs based almost exclusively on the success of their lithium project. With a number of projects expected to be advanced this year including the lithium I think this company is poised to move up to new levels again over the course of the next couple weeks and months.

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spearmint-begin-phase-ii-program-070100336.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spearmint-begin-phase-ii-program-070100336.html)

The company lists 14 projects on their website however I believe they will only be actively working on the ones that should provide the most value for the company over the next 12 months. With that in mind, I am going to list the ones I think have some potential for focus now.

Goose Gold Project - Located within a KM of the Keats discovery, a discovey that has taken New Found Gold from penny stock to a massive market cap over 1.5B, this small claim has huge potential for a discovery. Based on its specific location it well may be a cash cow for the company if it wanted to sell to the other mining companies in the area once their work program is complete this year. I understand the planned program is for a small grid sampling mag survey and drilling on targets. We will need to see where the work goes but this will provide lots of news and updates as the program continues.

Perron East Gold Project - Located in Quebec, in the area of the Amex Exploration Inc and Starr Peaks discoveries, Spearmint has several claim that have been advanced through work with Laurentia Exploration. Work to date has included some airborne magnetic surveys and sampling. Laurentia is highly respected and in demand in the area as they have been responsible for the other companies discoveries. Recent news from Spearmint highlighted flow though cash being raised  which as stated by they company will be primarily used to advance a drilling program on the Perron properties. These properties have several faults on them and have lots of potential for a significant discovery.

Clayton Valley Clay project. - Located in Nevada bordering Cypress development. This project is where Spearmint is seeing most of it's current attention and value. The company completed an aggressive 10 hole drilling program in 2020 and hit the lithium bearing clay in every single hole. Samples from that program are currently undergoing metallurgy and initial tests showed 83% extraction. Currently these results are being confirmed but they are expected any time now. When the results are complete there will be a report done by Stantec that will highlight resource estimates and viability of the project. This is now an asset and whether the results indicate that more drilling is required or if they have enough for a reasonable estimate this project changes everything for this company. As lithium prices increase with demand this project will just add value. It is important to know,  other companies are spending millions on research and development in the area including CYP, ALB, PE and SLB. All of the investment directly helps SPMT in the proving of extraction methods make all the projects viable.

Clayton Valley Brine Project. - Several claims for Brine production. Not currently drilled as brine wells are very cost prohibitive costing up to 1m per hole. Pure Energy is partnered with Schlumberger to build extraction plants and refinery in the area proving that investment in the brine is also viable. I will be looking forward to announcements on these claims in the future as it seems like a really easy fit in regards to continuing to develop assets.

Several BC gold projects seem to be far down on the list so I don't expect them to get much attention with the focus being on eastern Canada based on the news however the company has a few projects that could be interesting. One is their vanadium project near  Chibougamau and another is the Case Lake Cesium Project. Both located near significant discoveries and with commodities that are on the critical list I think these could get some attention this year.

Anyway, I am bullish on the company. I have 150K shares currently and think it is going way higher. I expect lots of catalyst to come from the company virtually weekly for the foreseeable future so if nothing else we should learn were we stand in regards to the projects shortly. I won't provide any price target as until we know what the value of the Lithium is and what kind of results from the work programs are it will remain a very fluid situation. That said, I think it will keep chugging up aver the next several months.

As always, do some DD for yourselves. This is looking like a trans-formative year for this company. More cash in bank than at any time in company history and several key work programs planned and ongoing.

The long and short of this story is that someone, somewhere in Europe has placed an order for 200 million block shares at .58 cents per share. With the current price sitting just above 5c this has the potential to 10x in a very short time frame.  I encourage everyone to do their own DD, this is a HIGHLY UNUSUAL circumstance and I am playing it purely because I don't want to miss a potential 10x.

793,,2021-05-25 00:42:09,t3_nkcvlf,,pennystocks,"**Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor.  What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks.  They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants.  A little complicated, but hope you follow.  Exact wording from the agreement:  ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out  (x) 100 = $153  **+**
2. $1.00  equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume  being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

So what does this actually mean for the company.

1. They now have the funds in place to fully acquire LED Funding IV LLC and Lux Solutions, which will together become SmartGuard-Energy (SGE).
2. They now have the funds in place to acquire 19.99% of SmartGuard-Solutions LLC. (the plan is to eventually acquire 51% then 100% over time)
3.  Triton will purchase a number of Securities from FOMO CORP. having an aggregate value of $4,000,000 after a Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. 

Well now you may be asking yourself why does this make FOMO Corp any better of an investment... because the folks over at Triton aren't dumb and wouldn't throw $4MM at some non-sense. For real though lets briefly go through each of the 3 pieces that are being purchased.

&#x200B;

**LED Funding IV LLC**  [LED Funding - Energy Efficient Lighting Solutions (smartguard-energy.com)](https://smartguard-energy.com/) 

 I was going to write up a bunch of my own info here but it seems their websites FAQ site really does a great job of answering all the questions I had when viewing this from a client's point of view to see what kind of value they bring to the table. So here is a copy and paste from:

 [Frequently Asked Questions - LED Funding (smartguard-energy.com)](https://smartguard-energy.com/frequently-asked-questions/) 

>WHAT MAKES YOUR COMPANY DIFFERENT FROM MANY OTHERS IN THE MARKET?  
>  
>**We design, install, finance & service LED lighting & solar installations with a national footprint, all with a 10 year warranty covering any material failures & related labor replacement costs. We structure our financing so that our clients are always cash flow positive throughout the 10 year term. This results in dramatic & compelling savings for our clients who typically achieve IRR‚Äôs of 30% or more on the cost of a LED lighting installation over 10 years. Bottomline: the only cost our clients are responsible for is the cost of the electricity which, of course, operates at significantly reduced wattage levels as more fully described below. We know of no other credible national company offering this value proposition.**   
>  
>  
>  
>HOW IS IT POSSIBLE BY INSTALLING LED LIGHT TO REDUCE YOUR ENERGY BILL BY MORE THAT 50%? I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS 50% OF WHAT?  
>  
>**LED lights reduce current existing wattage draws of greater than 50%. For example, if you replace a 100 watt fluorescent lamp with a 40 watt LED lamp, by the laws of physics you save 60 watts while maintaining the same luminosity. There can be no other result. We then quantify those direct energy savings using the following formula: (current existing wattage MINUS new LED lamp wattage) x (number of lights) x (run hours of operation) x (current kWh rate). In addition to the savings generated from the wattage reduction by switching from Fluorescent to LED lights there are additional savings generated. One is by the elimination of the lighting maintenance associated with fluorescent lights that cost goes away with LED lights plus a small adjustment for a reduction in AC usage since LED lights operate ‚Äúcool‚Äù, ie., they don‚Äôt throw off heat which causes increased AC usage ‚Äì that equals the total energy savings.**   
>  
>  
>  
>WHAT LED MANUFACTURER DOES YOUR COMPANY USE? NOT ALL LED'S ARE CREATED EQUAL!  
>  
>**You are absolutely correct with that statement. We use only major, nationally recognized Tier 1 LED lighting manufacturers with UL or DLC certifications that have unquestioned financial credibility to back up their 10 year material/labor warranty. Furthermore, because of our nationwide operations and large volume of LED business, we can obtain significant discounts from the lighting manufacturers which are not generally available to the public.**   
>  
>  
>  
>WHEN YOU SAY NO OUT OF POCKET COST CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY?  
>  
>**What we mean by saying that our clients have no out-of-pocket cost is that we finance 100% of the cost of the retrofit in the form of a loan or finance lease for usually a 5 year term at competitive interest rates. Therefore, during the loan or lease amortization period clients will be cash flow positive meaning that the realized energy savings will always exceed the financing cost by a minimum of 10% ‚Äì this amount is usually significantly higher than 10%. Once the loan/lease amortization period is over, clients realize in cash the full amount of the calculated savings. Please be aware that there are significant tax benefits which our clients may be able to realize based on our finance structuring strategy.**   
>  
>  
>  
>HOW DO YOU MEASURE AND VERIFY SAVINGS?  
>  
>**For direct energy savings, we do a lighting audit which effectively consists of counting all existing lights & their wattages after which the savings are calculated as set forth above. After installation, we perform a measurement & verification using the IPMV protocol which verifies that the installed LED lights function at the rated wattage levels. A report of this M&V is provided to clients when completed.**

**SmartGuard Solutions** 

For this bit, it was not as simple to figure out as the Smartguard Solutions (SGS) site encompasses all of the services including robots-as-a-service, UV disinfection products, and all the energy products/services mentioned above. This is where many people do tend to get confused with all the different M&A activity. As far as I've come to understand it SGS, for the purposes of the FOMO Corp acquisition, will include the disinfection products, BUT NOT ROBOTICS.... for now. This is also on Vik's (FOMO's CEO) radar to acquire over time according to his bigger plans/goals he's discussed publicly. 

> SmartGuard-Solutions is marketing disinfection products with its own outreach and is negotiating joint marketing and sales agreements with several national maintenance and commercial real estate companies gaining time to market and scale advantages and extending its footprint throughout the country. The centerpiece of these marketing efforts is the offering of various types of Disinfection as a Service (‚ÄúDaaS‚Äù) models to clients using funding that has been provided to SGS by institutional investors. SGS believes that these marketing efforts will fuel the growth of ‚Äúas a Service‚Äù models which will provide short-term revenue and eliminate CapEx needs for its clients while, at the same time, provide the opportunity to generate long-term, annuity-type revenues. Such a recurring revenue model provides visibility to future revenues and cashflows and mirrors the strategy employed by SmartGuard Energy (https://smartguard-energy.com), also under definitive agreement for sale to FOMO. 

From Vik (FOMO CEO) regarding the real benefits of the Smartguard-Energy:

Now here's the big deal about SGS.... they were just awarded a non-competitive bid and procurement process award with the **US NAVY!!!!!!** The first order is for 25 units, but there is a $200,000 follow on order already being worked out and several more on the horizon with the military. Their product beat out 19 others and has been labeled a ""**unique or highly specialized‚Äù product.**  

&#x200B;

**HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER**

Well if haven't yet started assembling the pieces of the puzzle yourself, notice how each of the 3 entities mentioned above address a different need that buildings need, both with the current pandemic in mind but also the need for the world to address our energy issues. Having a company which can supply financing for these projects, the consultants/experts to design the systems, and the actual products themselves they are building a one-stop shop for disinfection and energy efficiency for large buildings and indoor public spaces. 

But wait.. .there's more.

I'll save you a lot of reading here and link to site with a short description.

Already acquired:

**Purge Virus -**  [Home - (purgevirus.com)](https://purgevirus.com/) 

Has a number of products, including smaller disinfection units based on UV light, portable solutions, and also bi-polar ionization in air ducts. Also, they procure PPE and offer installation services. Currently, their big news is a partnership with SOS (Safely Opening Schools) which makes available disinfection products to 130,000 public schools in the US.

**Independence LED** [Home | US Made 10 Year Warranty | Independence LED Lighting Solutions](https://independenceled.com/) 

Has similar services to SGE but they also manufacture their own lights in the USA. This is a big deal as they are also on the GSA Schedule which means GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, which also means other products offered by the acquisition targets, once the contracts are signed, will also be available for Gov't purchases!!!!!!!!

**Energy Intelligence Center**  [Home - Energy Intelligence Center](https://energyintelligencecenter.com/) 

EIC is an interesting one. They are all about optimization of existing systems for energy efficiency using Artificial Intelligence. I must say, I got lost down the rabbit hole on this one trying to understand it, but the tech behind it is very interesting. My very crude understanding of what is happening is using space inside buildings to store heat or cool air to redistribute later... honestly, I don't want to stick my foot in my mouth here so I'll just say read up... its fascinating to say the least. Here is a copy/past from their ""about"" page:

> The Energy Intelligence Center focuses on energy efficiency consulting and sustainability solutions. We start with the ‚Äúlow hanging fruit‚Äù by upgrading commercial property lighting and air conditioning as well as ventilation and refrigeration systems. We can save 50% or more on lighting with LEDs and save over 15% on HVAC, without changing any of the cooling equipment or impacting thermostat settings. For our energy intelligence, we integrate with existing Building Management Systems (BMS) and Building Automation Systems (BAS) as well as provide optimization for facilities that do not have BMS/BAS.

I've given you tons of information to rattle around your brains. Once I really got a handle on EVERYTHING that is going on here it was easy to see the value of the ""ecosystem"" (as he refers to it) Vik is trying to create. Each of these different pieces compliment each other in one way or another. When I thought one part might have been redundant, I found that they are quite different. For example, Ecolite manufactures LEDs, as does Independence LED, but Ecolite's manufacturing is done overseas allowing for two different tiers of products, depending on the clients wishes/budget/needs etc. 

The thing is that this isn't just a simple Covid play, or a Green energy play, or an AI powered efficiency, or a solar power play... ITS ALL OF THE ABOVE. 

Vik has long dreamt of creating CSTI 2.0. For those who aren't aware, CSTI was a tech company incubator in the late 90's early 00's that did quiet well for a long while. He wants to help these great ideas become even greater companies by having them work together to solve the problems facing building owners/operators/managers today while keeping in line with positive trends in all things energy related.

Right now, you can purchase this stock on a discount. Not long ago FOMC was trading over .02 on just the LOIs about SGE and Ecolite and the acquisition of Purge Virus. Now SGS is in the picture as well and funding is in place. If anyone is having trouble seeing the potential here then I don't know how else to explain it. 

The future will be bright here. Do you have the foresight to jump in early?

&#x200B;

Finally, check out this list of disclosures. Everything Vik does, he screams at the SEC and FINRA, look at me, this is what i'm up to.. .I'm telling everybody. So anyone who thinks something shady might be going on realize that NO ONE EVER would scream to regulators look at me, if they had something to hide.

Green technology innovators Cicle, Inc. and American Battery Metals Corporation [(OTCQB:ABML)](https://pr.report/TZR70fEq), an American-owned lithium-ion battery recycling technology and advanced extraction company with extensive mineral resources in Nevada, which is in the process of changing its name to American Battery Technology Company (""ABTC"") announced today a strategic partnership to create the first-of-its-kind centralized service operations for collection and recycling of electric vehicle batteries at Cicle EV ChargeParks. The ventures will team up to meet heightened consumer demand as all leading global automakers and truck fleets transition to electric mobility.

The strategic partnership solves a critical renewable energy supply problem for the fast-growing EV ecosystem. The growth of electric vehicles has so far relied on environmentally unfriendly and inefficient local power grids to supply energy for recharging short-range batteries in cars and trucks. The ABTC & Cicle ChargeParks collaboration creates a practical and highly advanced renewable energy technology solution.

Cicle ChargeParks patent-pending infrastructure is designed to recharge consumer EV's efficiently as well as house multiple ABTC collection points and operations across North America. ABTC may then collect the spent and damaged EV batteries and other lithium-ion products for recycling and core metals processing. Results: Cicle clean, safe & rapid EV charging facilities working collaboratively with ABTC green extraction and processing of metal battery components used to build high-range EV batteries that will drive the electric vehicle revolution.

""Together, Cicle and ABTC are creating an entirely new industry focused on carbon-negative facilities to accommodate a cutting-edge technology infrastructure, renewable energy operations and consumer experiences for the coming EV transformation,"" said Cicle CEO and Founder John Strisower. ""Cicle is designing its experiential and technical platform to capture, store and distribute clean power, including solar, wind, hydrogen as well as utilize mega-batteries so consumers and truckers will have the optimal EV experience for themselves - and the planet.""

""American Battery Metals Company is powering the future of clean energy through our advanced methodology for battery recycling,"" said Doug Cole, CEO of ABTC, which is expected to process about 20,000 tons of batteries annually with the fastest turnover of materials in the marketplace. ""Our team is thrilled to bring its world-class core metals chemical extraction and mineral recycling technology together with Cicle's ChargeParks infrastructure to create centralized, convenient collection of electric vehicle batteries and other lithium-ion powered tools and consumer electronics.""

As part of the concept, ABTC would support the recycling of EV batteries collected at future Cicle facilities. ABTC is proactively working to permit and construct a pilot battery recycling plant in Fernley, NV. The company is pioneering a closed-loop battery recycling process at this pilot plant that will separate and recover critical materials from end-of-life high-power batteries, as well as from defects and waste from battery manufacturing facilities. The recovered metals are refined to battery-grade specifications and then sold back into the supply chain in a true closed-loop process.

Good day everybody,

We are continuing coverage on **Troika Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRKA**

Current price $2.96/share

We alerted TRKA shares at $2.92/share in Monday‚Äôs session. After reaching a high of $3.15 early in the session the shares pulled back closing at $2.96 (+1.37%) per share.

**Consider:**

¬∑ Tiny float.

¬∑ Trading 42% off IPO price one month ago

¬∑ The acquisition of Redeeem may act as a catalyst for the company‚Äôs value.

¬∑ Blue chip client list.

Yesterday we mentioned that TRKA listed sixty big named clients and we want to show them to you:

Coca-Cola, Peleton, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Victorias Secret, Sony, Viacom, UFC, Starz, Tiffany & Co.,

Hulu, HBO, LA Rams, ABC, Golf Chanel, Warner Brothers, EA Sports, Coach, PGA Tour, Verizon Media,

ESPN, SoFi, CBS News, Peroni, CNN, KRUG, Prime Video, CBS Sports, Pirelli, Belvedere, Venn, St. Ives,

STARZ, ABC, Raiders, Fox, Veuve Cliquot, LACMA, Turner, MlBam, Discovery, Fox Sports, TBS, NFL, NBC

Sports, Paramount, AMC, Cartoon Network, Nickalodean, AT&T, IMAX, Motortrend, FX, Sinclair, Yahoo 

Sports, Sundance, Comedy Central, Sundance, A&E, Ubisoft, Spectrum, Big Ten Network.

This list of blue-chip clients is at the **core of TRKAs success**. These companies represent many things to the company including, but not limited to large budgets to spend on consulting services and the ability to pay their bills in a timely fashion. 

The addition of Redeeem to the TRKA list of capabilities may increase business for the company significantly and quickly. Look at that list of clients and imagine which ones could want to move into crypto currency and block chain transactions.

**The company's operating units are:**

**Redeeem Acquisition** \- An entity created to facilitate the acquisition, just this week, of Redeeem, the crypto/blockchain/NFT company. [Redeeem](https://www.redeeem.com/) is a non-custodial peer-to-peer exchange that lets you buy, sell, and trade fungible goods for bitcoin.

**Troika Services, Inc. (Global)** \- a performance marketing and data intelligence company whose mission is to translate quantifiable metrics into actionable insights and empower businesses to connect with consumers, enhance engagement and optimize brand performance.

**Troika Design Group, Inc. (Los Angeles)** \- a strategic brand consultancy with deep expertise in entertainment, media, sports, and consumer goods and service brands. Troika provides a creative fan-centric approach to integrated brand strategy, creative, research, and technology solutions that builds long-term brand awareness for clients through equity and consumer loyalty.

**MissionCulture LLC (New York) -** Mission-Media Holdings Limited (London) and Mission Media USA Inc. (its non-operating subsidiary) (collectively, known as ‚ÄúMission‚Äù) London-headquartered brand experience and communications companies that specializes in consumer immersion through a cultural lens, via live experiences, brand partnerships, public relations, including social and influencer engagement.

**Troika Labs -** a new division with the primary mission to leverage its expansive data and content creation capabilities to provide a fully integrated digital and creative offering to clients on a global scale.

Robert Machinist, Troika Chairman and CEO said, ‚Äúas consumer media consumption shifts across the various media platforms, marketers require a partner who understands their business, has deep knowledge of the changing environment, and the creative, technology and data services to help them reach their audience.‚Äù

The key to success in that endeavor, is to know who you are creating your content for and that is some of the expertise found at TRKA. The company lists these three areas of expertise available to its clients:

Research and Insights

Branding

Consumer engagement

TRKA has an enviable position in the changing world of media because they understand the changes and other companies are willing to pay them for their expertise. The TRKA emergence as a public company is likely to attract more business from large cap companies who are more comfortable doing business under the transparency offered by listed firms.

Building or strengthening a brand is a big task for any sized company and more and more that involves a presence on all types of media, including social media. Building their brand can be an exhaustive and oftentimes expensive task when attempted in house with employees. And even worse, it can be ineffective.

TRKA has a FYE of June 30th so any accretive value attributable to the Redeeem acquisition may not be immediately apparent. We eagerly await the overall impact on TRKA from the Redeeem acquisition.

804,,2021-05-25 13:42:58,t3_nkq28l,,pennystocks,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of¬† $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers‚Äô minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC‚Äôed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkq28l,GRAMF: Waiting for takeoff?
805,,2021-05-25 13:50:40,t3_nkq83u,,pennystocks,"When you are born, you are born into structure, literal and metaphorical. Your teachers, parents, boss; all teach you STRUCTURE. The difference between this norm you are used to and the MARKET is the market has NO structure.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'ApEs StIcK tOgEtHeR' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq83u,The Difference In A Trading Structure And A Trading System

Worksport's Bed Covers Charge EV Pickup Trucks from Ford, GM, Rivian and Atlis
Mentioned:	AAPL F GM NKLA TSLA WKSP
The first wave of EV pickup trucks is on the horizon and is anticipated to take over the automotive industry in the U.S.

Last week, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) previewed its new electric F-150 Lightning pickup, a relatively inexpensive electric version of the most popular vehicle in America, during a visit by President Biden. Ford had taken 20,000 reservations in less than 12 hours since the truck was officially unveiled.

Other major contenders like GM (NYSE: GM), Rivian, Atlis, Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are also set to release their EV pickup trucks on American roads soon.

Although there are plenty of pros to owning an EV pickup truck, range anxiety is a common concern among many.

To get the maximum EV range possible, the concept of adding solar panels to tonneau covers or truck bed covers seems like the natural next step. But, this hasn't materialized in production yet.

Worksport (OTC: WKSP), a tonneau cover market leader, provides solutions for forthcoming EV pickup trucks with its proprietary technology √¢?? the TerraVis√¢?¬¢ system.

About TerraVis√¢?¬¢ Solar Cover System

The TerraVis solar tonneau cover system consists of four monocrystalline foldable solar panels that have an output of approximately 1kW.

The system should be able to add 12 to 15 miles (20 to 24 km) of range to an electric pickup truck, which is 30% of the power needed for the average daily commute under optimal conditions.

The company has already forged original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supply partnerships with two EV Truck nameplates, one of which is in partnership with Nissan.

The TerraVis system is expected to cost less than 5% of the overall cost of a pickup truck. Furthermore, TerraVis is in development now to give current pickup truck owners access to EV tech without investing in a new truck and to further leverage the power of their electric truck in the future. It is a future-proof product that truck owners will bring as they upgrade and expand with more modular storage.

Not a One-Trick Pony

The TerraVis√¢?¬¢ system's application is not just limited to extending the mileage of EV pickup trucks.

The battery system, Terravis 'Cor' can also be touted as a mobile power plant. The system will take power from the cover and store it in modular battery packs √¢?? storing 1.5kWh of energy in up to four batteries. This can be stored and transported in the truck's bed using the TerraVis√¢?¬¢ mounting system.

The batteries can power almost anything with its built-in 2kWh power inverter from the job site or campsite which can be used in the event of a natural disaster or power outage.

The unique feature of the battery system is that it can be available for purchase as a standalone consumer product √¢?? even if you're not a truck owner.

Massive Potential

Worksport has been around for over a decade and has been successful with its lineup of five unique truck bed cover models. The company has an intellectual property portfolio of over 30 assets of utility patents and trademarks.

The company competes in many multibillion-dollar markets. The EV market is estimated to increase to $30 billion by 2030. This value may be much more than what is estimated with rumors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the bandwagon with its first generation of EVs. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. If the agreement were to take place, we could expect a prototype to be teased in early 2024.

The specialty-equipment market has a market value of over $12 billion as pickups alone account for over 25% of the market. The other big markets include the tonneau cover market ($600 million), the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion in 2020).

With the cumulative size forecasted over $24 billion by 2025, Worksport stands a chance to generate revenue over 1.5 billion, assuming a 5% market share. The company's market stretches beyond just the U.S., into Canada, Latin America, Australia and more.

Worksport currently has over $10 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. In February 2021, the company closed its oversubscribed Reg-A offering, raising $4 million. To date, the company has received over $2.9 million from the exercise of warrants associated with its Reg-A offering and has also raised an additional $3 million from non-brokered Private Placement.

'TerraVis is the culmination of Worksport's effort to look beyond our core business producing the highest quality tonneau covers for all truck owners,' said Steven Rossi, CEO and founder of Worksport. 'We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what a truck accessory can offer, and to do so, we are looking to the future of EV trucks to bring that technology one step closer to today's truck owners. Our solar-powered tonneau cover will allow anyone to generate and store power for use in their daily life √¢?? work and sport.'",nkqdd8,WKSP NEWS 5-25-21

809,,2021-05-25 14:19:02,t3_nkqueb,,pennystocks,"Back in January I wrote a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l4ny82/silicon_valley_ai_company_ssft_is_the_next_aitx/) about this AI company and put this gem in a lot of people's radar.  In the following 2 weeks the share price increased from $0.10 to $0.40. Then came the bear market and along with all the other penny stocks SSFT fell back to where it started(at least for me) to $0.10 again.

I accumulated more Sonasoft stocks in both periods, I currently have around 1.2 million shares. The reason that I did that was not to make a quick profit, it was simply investing in my future. I'm too busy to follow the markets everyday and do day trading. And with my past experience I saw that swing trading a discounted penny stock is much more profitable then taking risks every day.

**Last week two important things happened.**

**1- Annual financials are released**

**2- Investors meeting took place.**

These two events strengthened my confidence in my choice of investment. We are clearly in on a company that's destined to become a Nasdaq star.

Before we start with financials, let me explain what this company is all about.

SSFT used to be a data management company in Silicon Valley serving global clients for about 20 years. Company shifted it's focus from Data Management to an AI first solutions company in the early 2019 and went on with acquiring 3 AI companies and talents.

Their newly created AI platform Saibre (former NuGene) is currently used as a POC (Proof of Concept) product although even at this stage it started generating revenues.

Company's AI department annual revenue increased 15x (to 780k) YoY.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abjpi1fgm9171.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d092b078dd01efe7f5b2ae71268003d61d0a18a

Despite 2020 being a catastrophic year for many companies, Sonasoft managed to compete with previous year's revenue.

2020 total revenue has reached **$8,935,27**1 with an additional **$3,702,000** deferred revenue that is not added into 2020's numbers because the service in return has not been completed yet.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qek8u3y6o9171.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=535ff55e720db96182be7e16f0e7e6cd5ede3e00

So even in the worst year where companies cut their costs drastically Sonasoft managed to reach **over 10 million USD in revenues**. This also happened when they were building up their AI platform to become market ready. **The AI bots that's already contributing to the revenue will be bringing in full recurring revenues when they are 100% ready before the end of Q3 this year.**

Besides promising numbers everyone was curious about hearing about the new direction from the current management. Back in March, a couple of us reached the company and asked for a better PR channel and transparency. Company responded immediately and for the first time they organized an Investor's meeting with all of the top officials.

I'll share two short videos with CFO Rob Baumert and CEO Mike Khanna answering questions from investors.

# Sonasoft CFO Rob Baumert explaining AI company valuations

https://reddit.com/link/nkqueb/video/wddgstujo9171/player

To reiterate, the company valuations are typically 20x-100x in AI industry.At $0.10 share price and about $50 million market cap with about $10million revenues Sonasoft is a massively discounted AI company at this stage. That is mostly because their flagship product is not on the market yet and they are still a OTCQB company.

&#x200B;

# ""What is the revenue potential of Saibre AI?"" Sonasoft CEO answers.

https://reddit.com/link/nkqueb/video/jfz4wyybp9171/player

Sonasoft signed a revenue share agreement with Fidelity National (FIS) back in 2020. According to Mike each bot will bring in at least 180k upto 500k and more and with partnerships like FIS they will be reaching thousands of clients who will be creating multiple bots. **The recurring revenues that he's talking about is not per company, it's per bot!**

# Nasdaq listing

Almost all the penny stocks promise to be on Nasdaq or higher level markets one day, but maybe less than 10% of those really become one. This wasn't something that I'd take serious unless there were some solid steps towards that direction and the CEO announced a new addition to the team, Paul Schlosberg. I'm not sure if he will be an advisor or a board member but something sticks out in his Resume ""**He enjoyed over 10 years as a member of The NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Committee in Washington**""

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/)

If the requirements haven't changed $3 minimum share price is required to uplist. So there you go, people who ask what's the price target for this; the first PT is $3 and I think this will happen earliest  between Dec 2021 and Aug 2022. Given that they hired this person for it. All the other requirements are already met for Nasdaq.

&#x200B;

# What else?

They also gave a detailed demonstration of their SAIBRE platform. I'm a UI designer and from my point of view they created a product that's really well thought, easy to use and efficient.

Here are some screenshots of SAIBRE where they were creating new bots to go through and learn from massive data sets, only in minutes.

&#x200B;

**Here are some highlights from the meeting**

* AI platform patent application submitted at the end of 2020 .
* Replacement of Nugene with Saibre.
* NuGene reached limits, not enterprise scale. It was not built with easy of use which is a huge differential. Container model was causing hesitations with clients.
* Saibre in contrast is easy to use, scalable, efficient. Anybody can use Saibre, there's no tech leakage, customers can deploy a new bot with a single click.
* Company did an internal audit for engineering and sales.
* Developed agile approach to respond customer needs efficiently.
* OEM partners, last few months, ramped up work.
* Before the end of q3 bots will be ready.

**Rob Baumert CFO:**

* Big book of sonasoft is written.
* Significant changes to financial structure.
* Impact of discountinued operations. Econnect and Sonavault were loss makers and not part of AI. They were a drag. So they let them go. Cost savings are much more.  Now more focus on AI success.
* They looked at spending during 2020 reduced costs greatly during this period. Monthly cash burn is half now.
* 2021 coming with growth and recovery.
* Core team is strengthened.
* Increased AI expenses, FIS parnership strengthened. AI segment rev increased 15x.
* Secured their financial runway with funding.

**Max Lee Head of AI :**

* Saibre is a complete AI bot solution.
* We're on the shoulders of giants. Learned from previous systems.
* Nugene was a jack of all trades.  But required manpower and scaling was hard. Custom coding was a problem.
* Took the best parts and built Saibre.
* This AI is getting built to challenge all AI projects. Thousands of images are required to separate a dog picture from a cat picture for an AI. All need to be labeled and requires a lot of data. Other models requires vast amounts of data. If the data is noisy or mislabeled system can't learn.
* Current SSFT IP is like a young child. You give a child one example and the kid learns from a single experience.
* Kid understands that its a ball even if he partially sees the ball. The new IP is working similar to that.
* Future algorithms will take advantage of this basis.
* Max is also getting inspiration from biology and neurology.
* Less time to deploy with less resources

**Caroline Zaborowski - VP of Data Science:**

* All AI systems need datascientists. And Datascientists need efficient, easy to use and flexible systems
* Current systems are time consuming. Saibre is reducing time to value.
* They redesigned the workflow, less time is spent on data cleaning, reusing the components and more collab between data scientists which is really important.
* Can be used by experienced data scientist and a regular user.
* SSFT AI solution is far more adoptable by clients.

So there's still a lot to talk and tell about Sonasoft. The story is long.

The future of this company have 2 possible directions in my view.

1- Will become a one stop platform for AI solutions that all size of enterprises can use. AI is not for the most sophisticated or the most wealth and big anymore. They are bringing it to the masses.They will be listed in Nasdaq and keep on growing from there into a multi-billion dollar company.

2- As soon as they are listed on Nasdaq, with a working product and massive potential they will be acquired by giants.

If you are ready to invest for your future with optimum risk/reward, SSFT share price has found it's bottom at $0.10, has been here for a while but not for so long. Buy it and HODL guys.

**My first target is above $5 but I wont be selling it all at that level. We're only at the beginning.**

OCUP has had 4 evaluations by analysts in 2021, so these are recent, and all have given it a target price above 20. That would multiply the current price by roughly five. An any time we can have an investment multiply that way, it's worth looking into it.

So before anyone claims I'm a pumper: this is a super small clinical stage pharma (not a pennystock though) with a small pipeline running mostly on one product/idea, at least in the near future. It's a risky investment. Do your own D/D. Also, tomorrow they are hosting a webinar, so you can listen firsthand and form an opinion. 

Now for the D/D. Why are all analysts so optimistic about OCUP?

Well, anyone that has ever gone to the ophthalmologist to have their eyes/eyesight examined, will understand this one.

When we go to the eye dr., we are given eyedrops to enlarge our pupil. The black part of the eye. The black part of the eye, is like a hole. So the larger the hole, the better look the doctor can have into our eye. This is a VERY simplified explanation.

It takes at least 25 minutes for our pupil to dilate. After the exam, (anyone who has experienced it knows this), it takes a few hours for it to get back to normal. During those hours, we can't see well, our vision is blurred, we can't read a book, watch a screen or drive a car.

Some of us just take a bus home and wait it out. But for many of us, that time with blurred vision means we are going to miss more hours of work. That recovery time is worth money.

Well, currently there is no solution for this situation. You go to the eye doctor, your pupil is dilated, then you waist several hours after the visit waiting for your eyesight to recover.

OCUP have developed the eyedrops antidote. Very simple: eyedrops you receive at the end of the visit, which will bring your sight back to normal within roughly the same time frame it took for the pupil to dilate (about 20-25 minutes).

What this means is, anyone, worldwide, that goes to consult with an ophthalmologist, everyday, any day, that's the market for this product. 100 million visits pe year in the USA alone. And there is no alternative. They will OWN that market. Just imagine this: a product that every eye dr. around the world will have that will drastically improve the patient's experience by simply receiving some eyedrops that bring the eyesight to normal. You can go back to work, use the computer, drive etc.

That alone, is a good enough reason for betting on OCUP. That's worth billions. But it actually gets way better for four reasons:

1. This product has other uses, we are not going to get into all of them because they refer to more specific eye issues.
2. They are in Phase three, using a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
3. There is an additional HUGE use for this product.
4. The current market cap is very very low.

What the 505 pathway basically means is that the active ingredient, the main ingredient of this new product has already received FDA approval, twice. So what OCUP does is use the data that already exists about this compound to avoid a lengthy approval path. In other words: it makes the approval of the product way faster. And after 7 very successful trials involving over 200 patients, they are in the last stages of moving towards an approval request (which, as explained, can be obtained much faster). So we are talking about approved product this year.

As for the other huge market for OCUP. OCUP is using the same technology they developed to apply it, with slight changes of course, to different situations. One such situation is presbyopia. Don't let the name scare you, it's very simple: the need for reading glasses. Pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age needs reading glasses. It's part of the process of getting old. Almost 2 billion people worldwide suffer from it. That's how big the market is.

OCUP are again, creating something that doesn't really exist: eyedrops that will ""cure"" or delay presbyopia. Basically they can avoid, if not totally then partially, the need for reading glasses, simply by using eyedrops. A huge market, also with no real competitors.

There is more to write about OCUP and it's small but amazing pipeline. But just these things I mention is the reason I personally loved this find. I'm slowly increasing my position and waiting. It's a long position. It's not a company that creates huge news. So this is about buying cheap now and waiting. If the analysts are roughly right, we can quadruple our investment within 12 months. I'll take it.",nkrbpf,Why do Analysts give OCUP a 20 plus Target Price ? (currently at 4.30)

Both phases will be completed in the second half of this year. Market Cap 90M, addressable market 1B+. It's \`metal as fuck\`.

Having said all this, I am not a financial professional, and there are risks associated with the stock obviously.

**Problem:**

Antimicrobial resistance is a rapidly growing problem. It's estimated that 1 million people die because of AMR, and considering the pace, it can grow to 10 million by 2050. Health system is getting pretty desperate, because while bacteria are getting better at resistance, the system is running out of effective ammo. New / novel ways of treatment are urgently needed.

**Entasis Therapeutics:**

It is an AstraZeneca spin off, founded by scientists and executives from the company.

Background of the CEO Manos Perros:

‚ÄúPrior to this, Dr. Perros worked for AstraZeneca AB as vice president and head of its infection research and early development organization from 2010 to 2015 and as site head for its research center in Waltham, Massachusetts from 2012 to 2015. Prior to joining AstraZeneca, Dr. Perros served as director of the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases in Singapore, and prior to that, as vice-president and chief scientific officer, antivirals, at Pfizer, Inc. A chemist by training, Dr. Perros conducted his Ph.D. work in Belgium, France and Germany, and was an associate in the Biophysics department at Yale from 1993 to 1995. Dr. Perros received the PhRMA Discoverer‚Äôs Award in 2010.‚Äù

**Products**:

The company directly focuses on AMR. Has two products in late phase 3, which were due early- mid 2021 but got delayed because of COVID. The results are expected to come out H2 of 2021. Basically both catalysts are within a few months.

## Zoliflodacin for Super gonorrhea

[https://www.abbynews.com/trending-now/worrisome-cases-of-super-gonorrhea-reported-throughout-the-world/](https://www.abbynews.com/trending-now/worrisome-cases-of-super-gonorrhea-reported-throughout-the-world/)

Apparently Gonorrea develops resistance very easily and retains the resistance. Apart from the above 2, there are countless articles online on the issue. **‚ÄúGonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all of the antibiotics used for its treatment. We are currently down to one last recommended and effective class of antibiotics, cephalosporins, to treat this common infection.‚Äù**

Zoliflodacin was developed in 5-6 years ago and has been in trials since. It is fast tracked by FDA as the issue is huge. The drug has been getting media coverage since it started the trials:

I really like the article below, and I think the description is important:

[https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/new-drug-shows-promise-in-treating-gonorrhea-in-early-trials/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/new-drug-shows-promise-in-treating-gonorrhea-in-early-trials/)

‚Äúa molecule that has a new mechanism for killing bacteria. It works by interfering with an enzyme called [topoisomerase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyP0cEbqKTc), which plays a crucial role in keeping a cell's DNA from getting all twisted up like an old-fashioned curly phone cord. When things start getting too tightly wound, topoisomerase cuts the DNA strand, unwinds it, and reattaches it with a bit more slack. Topoisomerase inhibitors bind to the topoisomerase and stop it from doing its job, causing the bacteria to essentially shred its own genome; one source we talked to called this ‚Äúmetal as f\*#$.‚Äù

The description is very important for 2 reasons: because it is a novel drug its cross resistance is super low, meaning if the bacteria is resistant to another drug, the possibility of it being resistant to Z is very low. Also because it can serve as a treatment for other illnesses as well. The article below has a pretty long list of other bacteria in its \`activity against other bacterial species\` list.

[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00021](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00021)

Important to note that the drug‚Äôs efficacy was 96% in phase 2. (the main treatment had 100% in a small sample) But because of  the rising resistance, they think that Z will be used as a supporting medicine against resistant strains.

## sulbactam-durlobactam for Super acinetobacter

**Acinetobacter baumannii** can **cause** infections in the blood, urinary tract, and lungs (pneumonia), or in wounds in other parts of the body. Basically a general asshole that casues different shit in the body. ‚ÄúMultidrug-**resistant Acinetobacter baumannii** is recognized to be among the most difficult antimicrobial-**resistant** gram-negative bacilli to control and treat.‚Äù

In vitro Trials:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516359/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516359/)

Method: ‚ÄúIsolates were obtained from various body sites from patients in 37 countries and from six world regions between 2012 and 2016. Identification of carbapenem resistance mechanisms and assignment to A. baumannii clonal lineages was based on WGS.‚Äù

Conclusion:  Sulbactam/durlobactam had excellent in vitro potency against A. baumannii isolates, including those that were resistant to imipenem/meropenem, amikacin, minocycline and colistin, compared with other compounds. Sulbactam/durlobactam has the potential to become a useful addition to the limited armamentarium of drugs that can be used to treat this problem pathogen.

If a company gives out shares and warrants to its key employees, what percent of the time does the stock grow enough for the warrant to be in the money and exercised?  

I know that each situation is different but I would imagine it‚Äôs a really high percentage.  Does it actually play out that way?

I‚Äôm asking because I‚Äôm heavily invested in MLFB and they gave out .07 warrants last week when the stock price was at .0125. It‚Äôs currently sitting just under .03.  

From a pure warrant play perspective, are people missing the boat or do these convert at a lower percentage than I would expect?",nkwfj8,How often do warrants given out to key employees get exercised?

(If you are not using Twitter for real time penny info, I suggest you go there right now and get on it -- reddit is too slow and addicted to January/February stocks.) Anyway, today's announcements included:

**$FCGD** \- Alpharidge Capital, LLC

**$ILST** \- Alpharidge Capital, LLC

**$AAPT** \- SSM Monopoly 

Each ran a bit today as news broke, reaching 40-50% before retracing as front loaders took profits. I've been in $ILST since .0012 and and now enjoying free shares. These announcements come after a busy few weeks that included additional custos like $TONR, $MDCE, and others. These plays are of course not without risk. $TONR was almost immediately challenged out of the gate, and the past owners of other dead companies have also worked to reinstate ahead of court hearings for $RETC, $EVLI (both of which George Sharp has lost), $MNVN, and others. There are rewards as well, as the returns on SSM plays like $FBCD, $AVVH, and $IFAN would make any former reddit bagholder weep for joy -- and each of these still has room to run.

Anyway, the deadline for getting current on OTC Market is approaching, and dead tickers that don‚Äôt get current with be regulated to the Expert Market and un-tradable with most brokerage platforms.

830,,2021-05-25 20:03:30,t3_nkypih,,pennystocks," **ZGS** is a nanomaterials company which found its new beginnings 3 years ago as a business through science oriented board and continues to make progress towards feasible applications for Graphene which they source from their own Albany Graphite resource in ON.

The current board members of ZEN were voted in by investors 3 years ago. **What have they achieved so far?**

**5 IP of note undergoing testing or underway at this time.**

**Antiviral/Antibiotic/Antifungal ZENGuard ‚Ñ¢:**

Has strong purported reliability against drug-resistant disease**^((1))**. Functionality presents itself in the form of coatings for PPE in partnership with TreborRx of masks, mask filters and nitrile gloves. Phase 1 human trial testing of similar compound for pharmaceutical use case may begin sometime in the fall**^((2))****.** Through NucroTechnics they have confirmed that exposure of their compound does not lead to any irritation or sensitivity**^((3))**. Minimum concentration < 1¬µg/ml to achieve 99.9% effectiveness.

**Graphene-Enhanced Concrete:**

40% higher compressive and flexural strength at a 0.02% concentration of graphene, 84% at a 0.04% concentration**^((4))**.

**Graphene-Carbon Aerogel Batteries:**

Very exciting results through the German Aerospace Centre. 2 wt.% loading of graphene dispersed in aerogel and resulted in an initial specific discharge capacity of 2800 mAh/g and a discharge capacity of 1300 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current capacity of 186 mA/g^(()**^(5))**. A podcast**^((6))**(Nov '19) with Francis Dube suggests further developments on this technology should see light within the next year (at the time it was suggested a 2 year minimum).

**Dehumidification Membranes:**

Through a partnership with Evercloak. Increases power efficiency of HVAC systems by \~75%**^((7))**.

**Corrosion Protection Coatings:**

Testing shows improved wear resistance, extend engine life, increase fuel efficiency, and increased engine power in vehicles. Epoxy corrosion-inhibiting coating for steel showed minimal corrosion (3% of surface) after 10 days when exposed to highly corrosive saline solution. Two-year project studying graphene as a corrosion protective coating for steel**^((8))**.

**Maths! Earnings!** Numbers provided on ZENS' Investor presentation, **I'm filling the gaps**.

[Margin estimates of masks from SI user Garth https:\/\/www.siliconinvestor.com\/profile.aspx?userid=9151157](https://preview.redd.it/afewrvezlb171.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07d4fff41c2f308208337a71c2771f651c5cf8c)

Coating volume once ramped up (currently pilot stage) will be \~800million coated units per month \~2.4 billion per quarter. Earnings per unit provides **$0.03-$0.06** cents per unit giving **$2.19-$4.38 EPS** for 99,000,000 diluted shares with 24% corporate tax rate. This provides fair **2-3 year** **SP range of $30-$60** at full production capacity (upper end wont occur until we collapse our cost structure to enhance the unit margins).

Glove coatings at **$0.01-$0.04** per unit would add around **+$0.30-$1.20 EPS**, HVAC filters with coating at **$1.00-$4.00** per unit would provide **+$0.08-$0.30 EPS**. This adds onto the **max** 2-3 year SP range by **$5-$18 result in $35 - $70** on earnings from combined PPE & HVAC market penetration. We are currently expected to be at 32 million coatings per month by end of June. That is an annual rate of 384 million disregarding the ramping-up, providing **by June a floor EPS \~0.11 Justifying minimum of $4** if current extrinsic share price is allotted. November is when full production is expected. At least a full year or two will be required to prove earnings, stabilizing intrinsic share price.

A similar material to ZENGuard**‚Ñ¢** is being tested toward therapeutic usage**^((9))** within the human body. Therapeutic would disrupt portions of a massive industry so it's hard to take into account. We will see resistance from this sector, so do not expect this to happen quietly or easily. Controversy is likely if this portion is a success. This is where the true speculative value of ZGS will be. If they can pull off ZENGuard‚Ñ¢ they can redouble toward therapeutic and disrupt sectors of pharmaceuticals that have poor adaptability.

https://preview.redd.it/zc4o6922mb171.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=0069efc597b477278a30461a2d9fc64d558ec783

It kills superbugs, partially solving a present and future problem. Bacteria/viruses/fungi can't really adapt out of silver. It destroys the cells by lysis, so, if adopted, we may not see the problem we've seen caused by the overuse of antibiotics. Human/animal cells have more and thicker membranes, protecting them from lytic destruction. DNA I'm not too sure the effects toward, but should be minimal if any. Testing will confirm and is ongoing. 

**Great!.. What are we waiting for?**

A health advisory**^((10))** published April 2nd by Health Canada brought to light a series of unwarranted masks which were introduced into the markets late last spring, as to take advantage of the Covid-19 virus without safety testing or certification. These masks allegedly contained Graphene, causing a obvious holdup for our graphene-based coating for masks. Further info has been sent to HC and secondary testing is now underway & awaiting results.

https://preview.redd.it/ovc4sqk2mb171.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe3ff335b4c989d99ee79d6a0c06d3ad769a348

The major problem thus far with graphene markets, isn't about creating the tech, it has been about showing and exposing people to how effective small amounts of graphene are in improving already existing products. It's been shown that Graphene is a great additive for many applications, and provides **large efficiency bonuses from small % addition**, but many IP needs introduction to market or to create the markets. ZEN has done very well with getting reach arounds from companies; Board has alluded to other PPE + Filtration manufacturers expressing interest so keep posted. TreborRx has an **LOI** agreement to collaborate on a minimum 100,000,000 masks so it is not an expressly permanent agreement by any means.

They are sitting on $4mil cash from previous offering. Cash burn of \~1.5mil per quarter while setting up production infrastructure. Either **expect success out of ZENGuard‚Ñ¢** or **be ready for a little more dilution/warrants**.

**ZEN is on ISED of Government Canada! Test their material if you work for the government!**

Government website for test of ZENGuard ‚Ñ¢

**Evercloaks' membrane/filter samples are available for testing through ISED**

Government website for test of 3d-printed membrane is the same as above.

**3 YEAR ANNIVERSARY FOR CURRENT ZEN BOARD!**

Executive Chairman Francis Dub√© on Twitter:

**Closing Statements & Comments:**

Some may be worried ZENGuard ‚Ñ¢ is only a good product for corona but this is a product with no competition, it is an application to already existing product. Better masks would only benefit everyone in the future IMO.

This could be the beginning of something great, don't get too caught up in day-day movements, this could easily take months to move significantly so if you don't have patience this company might not be the right pick. Much news to come! Patience is key if you know what's coming.

Thank you for your time when reading and taking this innovative company into consideration. Evercloak and TreborRx, the partners of ZEN will provide great stories for scientific progress through future as well.

**Cheers to the future!**

Saw a few posts about this stock and I think tons of people are missing out. The need for security right now is obviously lower with COVID restricting large gatherings but as the world slowly opens up again, I think we could start to see Liberty Defense's tech everywhere.

Liberty Defense, while still currently in development, is working towards creating high-tech security solutions that use AI and 3D imaging. They are working out of Canada but they have distribution plans to go worldwide. The main thing that is going to attract investors to Liberty is its security system known as HEXWAVE.

HEXWAVE security barriers can be installed at points of entry at several venues, whether it be sporting events, TSA checkpoints, schools, or many other applications. As people walk through the gates, the 3D imaging tech is able to identify both metal and non-metal weapons. Then, the AI uses a threat-level system to determine the risk of the item and if anything is considered dangerous, an individual can be flagged to then be further searched or apprehended. The speed at which this system works is boggling with a throughput of 1000 people an hour. I'm imagining how much time can be saved and how many long lines can be avoided if these things were implemented.

HEX WAVE is currently in Beta and is being tested by the groups and organizations below. If testing goes well they, are planning their launch in 2022 and I think they could see some huge revenue. Besides HEXWAVE, their other two big-time projects are High Definition - Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) and their Shoe Scanner. Both of these projects have received support and funding from the American Department of Homeland Security and planned to be implemented by the TSA. This tech works similarly by using imaging tech to identify foreign objects on an individual without the need for the removal of coats, jackets, or shoes.

&#x200B;

At an entry point of $0.47, I really don't see a reason why not to get in on Liberty Defense, even if just for a small investment to hold. When public venues open up even further and these guys being to roll out their amazing line of security devices, their potential revenue could be staggering.

Since announcing the invitation just this morning, the registration rate has been even bigger than anticipated.

""We're taking our time in the launch of our Vaycaychella App to make sure everyone that signs up gets the support they need,"" said CEO William ""Bill"" Justice. ""We invested in having good online support available to users before we launched the App and now we're registering everyone first with our online support before they log on to the App for the first time. Our support team will be available online every step of the way.""

Vaycaychella allows anyone and everyone access to purchasing a short-term rental vacation property that can be listed on Airbnb, VRBO and Booking.com.

The Vaycaychella App lets buyers create a profile to present their own talent and experience in addition to presenting the potential of the property to generate income.

Anyone can register as an investor - individuals or institutions. Registered investors can view details on the prospective short-term vacation rental properties and the individuals behind the vacation rental businesses that will be running the property.

Registered investors should check back frequently. The App is just getting started, giving Rentrepreneurs time to post their projects. Keep coming back and seeing what's new and find the one that's right for you.

The Vaycaychella App can help entrepreneurs finance property purchases in California and Florida, for example, as well as financing property purchases in Cuba and Kenya. Vaycaychella is particularly enthusiastic about bringing P2P finance to the world's developing economic regions.

Vaycaychella believes its long-term success will be closely aligned with the opportunity to connect social responsibility and vacation fun and the ability to profit by becoming a vacation property owner or a P2P investor empowering the vacation property owner in both the developed and developing world economies.

The $1.6 trillion global travel industry is one of the largest and fastest growing business sectors.

The Vaycaychella App is a product of WSGF's subsidiary, also called Vaycaychella.

WSGF acquired Vaycaychella last year and made Vaycaychella its primary business focus. WSGF is in the process of changing its name to reflect the new business focus.

Vaycaychella, prior to being acquired by WSGF, built a pilot alternative finance business for short-term rental vacation properties backing a portfolio of beach rentals in the Caribbean. Vaycaychella built a portfolio valued at $1.2 million.

Vaycaychella has continued to expand its pilot portfolio since coming under WSGF, notably adding a Boutique Hotel in Havana, Cuba, expected to be opening soon.",nl4zlf,Vaycaychella $WSGF app registration bigger than expected

We still have a HUGE ride up ahead of us. 

Some quick info...This company holds an international patent for processing oil sands.  What does this mean?  There are over 300 billion barrels of oil in the sands of Canada alone (remember this patent is for Russia, USA, and Canada). Typically the process involves an immense amount of environmental damage that leaves behind tailing ponds of contaminated water/sand/chemicals. Petroteq have developed and patented a process wherein they are able to draw up to **95% of the oil out of the sand**, while recovering 99.99% of the solvent used to do so **without leaving behind any waste water**.  This means that they are able to extract almost 15% more oil from oil sands than traditional methods, and the sand comes out clean and ready to be sold as a separate commodity.  It is truly revolutionary and I can see why big oil players would want to get their hands on this patent.  Below is a picture of said patent.

[PQEFF PATENT](https://preview.redd.it/41g4oqs37d171.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=beec161bb931eeaf348bd404a23dcd87a204736f)

In the oil world patents are one of the only things that protect small companies from being swallowed up by the larger players.  If the larger players cant build around the patent to make something equally as disturbing in the market they will either initiate a hostile takeover or a buyout in order to acquire the technology.

They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO‚Äôed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶which is 100% growth again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I believe that estimate is light!

You may have heard of $CTXR on this sub with people saying that they're releasing Phase 3 results (interim) any day now for their Mino-Lok, a medication meant to salvage catheters. So how did Citius end up receiving this award at a cell and gene therapy annual meeting?

Citius has many products in their pipeline, including this iMSC drug/therapy that is meant to repair pulmonary tissue as a cause of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) from COVID-19. 

What the fuck is iMSC and why should I care about it? MSC's are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells found in your bone marrow, umbilical cord cells, molar cells or amniotic fluid that are extracted and used to repair other tissues. The problem with these, as you can clearly tell, is that they have to be extracted in a limited fashion.

> Our next generation ‚Äúinduced‚Äù mesenchymal stem-cell (i-MSC) therapy is derived from an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) bank. Previous research shows that MSCs produce potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodality properties that help counter the cytokine storm that brings about ARDS. MSCs also restore endothelial and epithelial barrier integrity, enhance the clearing of fluid from the lungs, and may exhibit antimicrobial properties.

Hold on. What's iPSC? 

>iPSC are derived from skin or blood cells that have been reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state that enables the development of an unlimited source of any type of human cell needed for therapeutic purposes. 

Holy moly. I'm saying they received the best poster award because they've shown, in pre-clinical stages, that they can safely repair pulmonary tissue with this novel technology, without the limitations of MSC - iMSC have an unlimited source.

**TL;DR**: MSCs have shown effectiveness in treating inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is of growing concern in the light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. ARDS is characterized by extensive inflammation in the lungs, causing severe shortness of breath. MSCs sourced from bone marrow, umbilical cord tissue, and adipose tissue are all being considered as possible therapies to treat ARDS. However, the ability to scale-up MSC manufacturing to meet the needs of the current crisis remains an open challenge. MSCs derived from iPSCs (iMSCs) offer a near limitless supply of cell due to their superior expansion potential.

**Ok, so, I was asked to explain the pipeline of BNTC.**

Please note, I don't know this company, **I don't have a position**, have not verified their financial situation, partnerships, stock valuation, etc. All I am doing, per request of a fellow reddit, is to explain the pipeline in terms that are easy to understand so that people might have a better idea what they would be buying into.

This company is developing what they call ""a combination of gene therapy and RNA interference‚Äù, (gene silencing). Before we explain this, we should focus on a few basic things.

**First this is an IND**. It's an investigational new drug. This obviously means, and BNTC is very clear about it,  that they are developing a new technology that hasn't been used, and more importantly, approved before. 

The positive side of this is, that if it is approved, it has no competitors, and as we will see, huge potential. The negative side is, it will take several years to get approved, and the FDA is very careful about approving something completely new, obviously.

**Another important factor**: so far these products are in the preclinical/non-clinical stage. This means  everything done until now has been tested in a laboratory setting (for example in tissues, or in animals). **Nothing has been tested on humans**.  

As an investor, it is important to note two things:

1. The company has yet to make any plans/requests for a clinical trial. So we are talking about approval several years from now.

2. Potential drugs and treatments become promising or irrelevant mostly during clinical trials.. So it's a big risk.

**As for the technology, put into simple words**: Let‚Äôs try

Their main product is BB301. Their other product, BB103 (they could have chosen less confusing numbers IMO) is more of the same: they are testing the core technology.

BB301 is being developed to treat Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). What you need to know about it: it's very rare, and it is caused by a malfunctioning gene.

So, if bb301 eventually is approved, this is NOT what BNTC is building on. That in itself is a small market. But, it would mean the TECHNOLOGY works, and then applying it to many, many other situations caused by gene mutations, etc, is where the money is at. Potentially, a lot of money. 

**So what BNTC is doing?** When a gene malfunctions, like in OPMD or when a virus reactivates like in Hepatitis B (the target of their other product) essentially **a gene is producing a protein that is harmful**. **The objective is to neutralize, or silence, or knockdown the gene**. Basically, not allow it to work.

To do that, the therapies target RNA, a molecule that has many functions, among which, to carry ""information"" needed to produce the protein.

By silencing the mRNA (the messenger RNA, the one sending messages) the malfunctioning gene can no longer produce the bad protein.  **BNTC claims that other companies are using the following method:**

They introduce into the patient a synthetic RNA (made in a laboratory)  that is built in such a way that our body will cut it in half. One half then, feeling lonely so to speak, will bond with that messenger we want to stop from sending messages to produce the bad protein. That will effectively stop the mRNA and that will ""knockdown"" the gene.

**BTNC has a better idea:** instead of having to constantly introduce synthetic RNA (which is like needing to take medicine all the time), they introduce a DNA construct that keeps producing the RNA needed to silence the bad gene.

**A DNA construct is basically a DNA made in a lab**. Don't confuse it with what people call ""my DNA"". Our ""DNA"" is actually a genome, like a sequence made from many DNA-like molecules. Like a chain of DNA's if you will. So the DNA will not interfere with ‚Äúour DNA‚Äù.

**The benefit of BTNC's method** would be that once the DNA construct is introduced, it produces the RNA forever, solving the problem with one therapeutic intervention. It's like taking one pill, and solving a problem that today can't really be solved and requires taking medicine daily. It's also better than the system being developed by rivals (that also doesn't exist yet) that requires introducing the RNA time and time again.

**So, how great is this and should you invest in BTNC?** From a scientific standpoint today, a problem even greater than developing these products, something that is already pretty advanced, is actually ‚Äúsending‚Äù them to where they need to go in our body. The delivery system. That has been very challenging and so far no one has a clear solution for this.  BTNC claims the use of a DNA construct simplifies the delivery. They could use delivery systems similar to those employed to deliver, for example, some of the covid vaccines being used today.  I don't see that. I don't think they have that technology figured out yet for the use BTNC intends. That's why their explanation isn't too specific. 

The other issue is that it remains to be seen what that DNA construct will do inside the patient‚Äôs body. Remember, it will be ‚Äúproducing‚Äù an RNA endlessly. Yes, that RNA might help block the bad gene. But it might also interfere with genes and production of proteins we badly need. Since it will be in the body forever, and can‚Äôt be taken out (it‚Äôs not like a device, it becomes ‚Äúpart‚Äù of the patient) the FDA has already made it clear that it doesn‚Äôt feel too great about DNA constructs. It's not an easy approval.

**Bottom line**. You might be investing in a company that is ‚Äúbuilding a new internet‚Äù. A company that is in the forefront of technology that will revolutionize the world as we know it. At least in terms of health, longevity and medicine. That‚Äôs exciting. It‚Äôs coming, it will happen eventually. 

On the other hand, the product is a very very long way from being ready and hasn‚Äôt been tested in humans. It‚Äôs a very long play and many things might go wrong along the way. I don‚Äôt think anyone could expect any truly meaningful news in the next couple of years, at least, in terms of pure science.",nldgdx,D/D on BNTC pipeline per request

* Announced enrollment has commenced and three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed in the first Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020 intestinal alkaline phosphatase (""IAP"") intended to support development of SYN-020 in multiple indications
* Announced enrollment has commenced and the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (""HCT"") recipients
* Current cash position of approximately $76.9 million
* Received $8.0 million from the exercise of warrants
* Current cash runway provides funding into 2023 and ability to fund Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 as well as SYN-020 intestinal alkaline phosphatase (""IAP"") through proof-of-concept

**Upcoming milestones, pandemic conditions permitting:**

* Topline data from the Phase 1a single-ascending-dose (""SAD"") study of SYN-020 anticipated during **Q3 2021**
* Expect to commence second Phase 1a multiple-ascending-dose (""MAD"") study of SYN-020 during **Q3 2021**; topline data anticipated during **Q2 2022**
* Topline data readout from the first antibiotic cohort of the SYN-004 Phase1b/2a clinical trial is expected during **Q4 2021**

""During the first quarter of 2021 we remained **diligently focused** on advancing our portfolio of GI and microbiome-focused clinical programs and were pleased to announce the commencement of clinical trials for our SYN-004 and SYN-020 programs,"" said Steven A. Shallcross, Chief Executive Officer of Synthetic Biologics. ""Enrollment in the SYN-004 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients is underway at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (""Washington University"") and the first patient of the first antibiotic cohort was dosed earlier this year. We believe SYN-004 has the potential to address an important and underserved patient population, and may significantly improve outcomes for allogeneic HCT recipients by preventing downstream complications often associated with disruption of the gut microbiome by intravenous (""IV"") beta-lactam antibiotics. If enrollment proceeds as planned, we anticipate announcing topline data from the first antibiotic cohort during the **fourth quarter of 2021**, pandemic conditions permitting.""

Mr. Shallcross continued, ""We were also very excited to announce the initiation of a Phase 1a single-ascending-dose clinical trial of our SYN-020 IAP program during the first quarter of 2021. To date, three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed and we remain on track to report topline data from this study during the third quarter of 2021, pandemic conditions permitting. A second Phase 1a multiple-ascending-dose study is also expected to begin enrollment during the third quarter of 2021 with topline data expected early next year. Both studies are designed to support the advancement of SYN-020 in multiple potential therapeutic indications, including celiac disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (""NAFLD"") and age-related metabolic and inflammatory diseases. We are very excited about the potential for this program to be a long-term value driver for our Company and look forward to sharing important updates.""

Mr. Shallcross concluded, ""While we remain focused on the execution of our clinical development activities, we were also able raise net proceeds of approximately $66 million as well as $8.0 million in proceeds from the cash exercise of warrants, significantly strengthening our balance sheet and financial position. As a result of these activities, our current cash position is approximately $76.9 million. Importantly, our fortified balance sheet will fully fund our SYN-004 and SYN-020 clinical programs through proof-of-concept clinical studies, and help accelerate our other ongoing activities.""

**Clinical Development and Operational Update**

* Announced Washington University has begun enrollment and the first patient was dosed in the first antibiotic cohort of the Company's Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD)
* Announced enrollment has commenced and three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed in a Phase 1a SAD clinical trial of SYN-020 in healthy adult volunteers
* Strengthened balance sheet by raising net proceeds of $66 million from the sale of common stock via the Company's At-The-Market (""ATM"") facility and $8.0 million resulting from the cash exercise of a portion of Company's 2018 warrants during Q1 2021

**Quarter Ended** **March 31, 2020** **Financial Results**

General and administrative expenses increased by 2% to approximately $1.42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $1.39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to higher insurance costs, audit fees, and legal costs offset by a reduction in patent related legal fees, consulting fees and travel expense. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $82,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $65,000 the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Research and development expenses decreased by 32% to approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily the result of lower indirect program costs for the three months ended March 31, 2021, including salary and related expense reductions, a decrease in manufacturing costs for SYN-020 and market research. In addition, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's development partner (Washington University) reduced their operating capacity during 2021 to include only essential activities as part of their pandemic response, which delayed the start of the Company's clinical trial, resulting in lower clinical trial expenses for the quarter. The research and development costs incurred during the quarter were primarily related to the Company's Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients. The Company anticipates research and development expense to increase as ongoing clinical trials continue to enroll patients. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $19,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $18,000 related to stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Other income was $347 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to other income of $38,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 is primarily comprised of interest income.

Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021 totaled $76.9 million, an increase of $70.7 million from December 31, 2020.

Creative Medical Technology Holdings $CELZ is a company I encourage everyone to look into. Co-founded by Dr. Amit Patel, the inventor of Jadicell, Dr. Tom Ichim and Tim Warbington, the company is engaged in stem cell research to treat common abundant diseases that impact the world's population.

The company has filed an IND application with the FDA on its newest technology, ImmCelz, for the treatment of stroke. After back and forth Q&A, the FDA has provided constructive feedback for the IND on May 14th, which the company is now working on to submit to the FDA for this first of its kind technology, and then will await approval to begin clinical trials. 
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-responds-to-creative-medical-technology-holdings-regarding-its-immcelz-ind-for-stroke-treatment-301291533.html 

ImmCelz is set to revolutionize the treatment of far-reaching, common diseases such as stroke, liver failure, kidney failure, heart attack, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, transplant rejection and Parkinson's disease with positive preclinical for each. The invention of Dr. Amit Patel and Dr. Thomas Ichim, ImmCelz treatment involves utilization of allogenic Jadicell stem cells outside of the body to ""reprogram"" the patient's own immune cells so as to endow upon the immune cells regenerative activities. The company believes that ""educated"" immune cells may be superior to stem cells because of their: a) ability to replicate and form ""memory"" cells; b) substantially smaller size, which allows for superior biodistribution than stem cells; and c) adeptness at surviving in conditions such as hypoxia or acidosis, which would inactivate stem cells. Preclinical trials have shown an 85% increased improvement with ImmCelz versus the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of stroke. 

Once FDA approval is received to begin clinical trials for the treatment of stroke, the company intends to file other IND applications for ImmCelz based on positive preclinical results in treating the common diseases mentioned earlier. Annually, these are all multi-billion dollar areas. The ability to provide a non-pharma, one-time procedure for those affected by these diseases is a game changer.

The company has recently brought on renowned kidney specialist, Dr. Caigan Du, and clinical trial expert, Dr.¬†Boris Reznik, to its scientific advisory board. This week it announced that Dr. Manillo Ricordi, world renowned clinician and scientist at the University of Miami and Diabetes Research Institute has joined the team. Dr. Ricordi called the company's ImmCelz technology a ""first-in-class approach to leveraging the immune system to act in a regenerative manner to treat a wide variety of indications including diabetes, liver failure, heart failure, and stroke.""

TORONTO and KNOXVILLE, Tenn., May 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Solar Alliance Energy Inc. (‚ÄòSolar Alliance‚Äô or the ‚ÄòCompany‚Äô) (TSX-V: SOLR)** is pleased to announce it has signed a binding Letter of Intent (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with Abundant Solar Power Inc. (‚ÄúAbundant‚Äù) to build, own and operate a 350 kilowatt (‚ÄúkW‚Äù) solar project in New York State (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù).  


The construction-ready Project is permitted and is supported by a 30 year power purchase agreement. This Project will be the first solar project in the Company‚Äôs portfolio of operating solar assets and will generate a recurring revenue stream over its 30 year life.

‚ÄúThis project in New York State represents a significant catalyst for Solar Alliance and clearly outlines the potential for strong growth we see in our ability to build, own and operate assets in the US market‚Äù said Solar Alliance CEO Myke Clark. ‚ÄúThis project is ready to build and is backed by a 30 year power purchase agreement that will provide a recurring revenue stream to Solar Alliance. Abundant is a respected developer of solar projects and we are confident we can build on our relationship in order to access a larger pipeline of solar projects that we can develop, own and operate.‚Äù

Solar Alliance anticipates signing an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (‚ÄúEPC‚Äù) contract with Abundant. Construction on the Project is expected to commence this summer and is anticipated to be in operation by the end of 2021.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to be working with Solar Alliance on this project and see the potential for an expanded relationship moving forward,‚Äù said Abundant‚Äôs CEO Richard Lu. ‚ÄúAbundant Solar has an extensive pipeline of solar projects in development and we see strong syngergies between our two teams. We will be working diligently with Solar Alliance to complete this project on time and on budget this year.‚Äù

The net capital cost for the project is expected to be approximately US$525,000 and will be financed by Solar Alliance either through equity or a combination of debt and equity. As part of the Company‚Äôs expansion strategy, Solar Alliance is also assessing opportunities to acquire or partner on earlier stage develop projects that would eventually be built, owned and operated by the Company. This complements Solar Alliance‚Äôs growing business of designing, engineering and installation solar systems for third party owners.

‚ÄúSolar Alliance has made the strategic decision to pursue growing, near term revenue opportunities in addition to building, owning and operating our own solar projects. This allows us to generate revenue to support our operations while we grow our portfolio of assets under ownership, concluded Clark.

All the gains I took from this I'm now injecting back into $WSGF as it's come all the way back down to .022 as of writing.

Why? Normal P&D it looks like. For those of you I need remind though Vacaychella was trending on a bullish af chart up to .035 BEFORE the app even launched. Now with this app launch this company has promise of doing big things.

If you have signed up for Vacaychella yourself you most likely would have received an email such as I have that details how insane this has been and they were not ready for how many sign ups they were going to receive. They are doing numbers larger than expected for this app phase and are primed for steady growth here on out in. This is a trillion dollar business may I remind you and they are revolutionizing it which is DIFFICULT TO DO. They have an idea and are pairing with large friends behind them including Booking.com and AirBnB which is already the biggest partners out there. Ideas like this that exist in massive caps like real estate do not come around often.

Now I've been pretty good at sliding in and out of P&D including 3xing TAWNF 2xing ASTI 2xing this and I'm ready to jump back in.

Now the floor for this previous sat at .02 which is a huge indicator for me that I want in considering were at .022. This is also finally a company that is going to be doing something. Everyone that is dumping here isn't seeing how insane this charts recovery can be and I think it is overselling and going to recover strong for a good 10% gain over the next couple days then after we establish some sideways action it'll start steaming up the way it did before.

Funding from Australian Government, Peer-Reviewed research from University of Queensland, FORBES.COM ARTICLE [https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/05/13/ev-range-breakthrough-as-new-aluminum-ion-battery-charges-60-times-faster-than-lithium-ion/?sh=17fe8676d287](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/05/13/ev-range-breakthrough-as-new-aluminum-ion-battery-charges-60-times-faster-than-lithium-ion/?sh=17fe8676d287)

Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) is an Australian based company that specializes in the production and sale of graphene enhanced products. Traditionally cost prohibitive and difficult to produce high quality Graphene, GMG‚Äôs proprietary production method using Natural Gas (Methane) instead of Graphite allows for high quality, inexpensive graphene to be produced.  This allows GMG to pivot towards fast-charging Aluminum-Ion battery prototyping/production as their primary products.

&#x200B;

ALUMINUM-ION BATTERIES AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Aluminum-Ion Batteries are a newer type of battery currently being researched and tested by a number of organizations, including University of Queensland (UQ) and Stanford University, and have shown increasing promise as an alternative to Lithium-ion batteries. The additional benefit of using little-to-no heavy metals (i.e. Lithium, Cobalt, etc.) makes this a super attractive formulation.

One of the limiting factors has been the graphite/graphene (depending on prototype tested) used in the battery. While I‚Äôm not going to deep dive into the ins and outs of graphene production, traditional methods producing graphene from Graphite are expensive and difficult to obtain a high-quality plane structure. This is where GMG comes in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The University of Queensland, in their Aussie government funded research into Aluminum-Ion batteries, went with GMG to supply their graphene and found they were able to achieve fantastic results. GMG‚Äôs high quality graphene plane structure produced from natural gas instead of graphite allowed for a breakthrough in the amount of aluminum atoms that could be ‚Äúinserted‚Äù inside of the graphene planes (layers) to produce high density electrodes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

THE RESULT OF THIS?

A high-density battery that acts practically like a super capacitor. **Charges times up to 60x-70x faster and capacity comparable to traditional lithium-ion batteries WITHOUT EXHIBITING HEAT ISSUES THAT WOULD CAUSE A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY TO EXPLODE TRYING TO CHARGE THIS FAST**. Numbers like these might sound too good to be true, but this is peer reviewed research by the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland. And Graphene Manufacturing Group has exclusive access to this battery formulation through their research and commercialization agreement with the University of Queensland and Uniquest (UQ's commercialization company) because they supplied the Graphene free of charge.

&#x200B;

ENERGY DENSITY

Below is a chart of the current Aluminum-Ion technologies being tested.

[\*Lithium Ion: Energy Density \~100-265 Wh\/kg, Power Density \~250 ‚Äì 340 W\/kg  \(Source: See links at end of page\)\*](https://preview.redd.it/sbsaun2ddh171.jpg?width=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23d77989abc17d4d72c87ea88c697acfd37078e1)

&#x200B;

>‚ÄùGMG Managing Director Craig Nicol insisted that while his company‚Äôs cells were not the only graphene aluminum-ion cells under development, they were easily the strongest, most reliable and fastest charging.  
>  
>‚ÄúIt charges so fast it‚Äôs basically a super capacitor,‚Äù Nicol claimed. ‚ÄúIt charges a coin cell in less than 10 seconds.‚Äù

&#x200B;

MULTIPLE OBVIOUS USES FOR BATTERIES LIKE THIS

* Cars ‚Äì Fully charge a car in 10-20 minutes
* Cell phones ‚Äì Fully charge a cell phone in 1-5 minutes
* Laptops
* Coin Cells (watch batteries) ‚Äì Fully charge in 10 seconds
* Powerwalls
* etc

&#x200B;

PROS

* Much faster charge times
* Little to no Heat buildup
   * Safer charging and at faster rates
   * Weight reduction in batteries (less cooling and thermal management circuitry)
* Reduce dependence on China for rare earth heavy metals
* Materials are highly recyclable and easy to obtain
* Cycle lifespan up to 3x longer than traditional Li-ion
* Can fit into same housings and operate at the same voltages as Li-Ion

&#x200B;

>‚ÄúSo far there are no temperature problems. Twenty percent of a lithium-ion battery pack (in a vehicle) is to do with cooling them. There is a very high chance that we won‚Äôt need that cooling or heating at all,‚Äù Nicol claimed. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt need circuits for cooling or heating, which currently accounts for about 80kg in a 100kWh pack.‚Äù

&#x200B;

CONS AND OTHER NOTABLES

I will always be the first one to talk about potential caveats and downsides:

* Graphene is traditionally expensive - GMG‚Äôs method claims that it is much cheaper to produce than traditional methods, but final figures are still yet to be known.  Current prices from other producers are around $100/gram, but this figure is for typical graphene production methods using mined graphite. GMG has plans to ramp up production so pricing models are yet to be known. I was unable to find how much graphene is required per kg of battery, likely proprietary info right now.
* Infrastructure ‚Äì If charge times truly are this fast, our electric grid simply cannot handle large batteries charging this quickly.
   * However there are proposed workarounds for this. For example, I have seen suggestions of charging an Aluminum-ion powerwall to full capacity at a slower rate and then using said powerwall to fast-charge an EV separate from the grid.
* This is still in early prototyping right now but the research and production methods are sound. GMG is a smaller company and it will take time to ramp up graphene production and develop new products.

&#x200B;

GMG‚ÄôS PLAN MOVING FORWARD

Graphene Manufacturing Group currently has research and commercialization agreements with the University of Queensland and Uniquest and has begun the prototyping stage:

>‚ÄúUnder the agreement, GMG will manufacture commercial battery prototypes for watches, phones, laptops, electric vehicles and grid storage with technology developed at the University of Queensland (‚ÄúUQ‚Äù). GMG has also signed a license agreement with Uniquest, the University of Queensland's commercialization company, which provides GMG exclusive license of the technology for battery cathodes.‚Äù

Currently, their revenue is pretty small from their traditional graphene products they sell, but they have made it clear that they are pivoting to batteries this year. GMG is starting with coin cell batteries by the end of 2021 and are aiming to work their way up to automotive style batteries estimated around 2024. Currently they hope to run with the technology and vertically integrate it themselves instead of licensing the technology. However, they have stated this is not set in stone and potential partnerships with phone / automotive companies could be an option.

GMG recently went public and trades as $GMG.V / $GMGMF

Warning - new CEO sucks a bit as a salesman, Just be patient till he warms up. This is a very smart technical guy with clear strategic vision: exploring training market, making smaller more affordable home versions. This is great!

Particularly, the agreement with CoolerMaster (Taiwanese CPU cooler manufacturer. Check out their products...) to produce gaming equipment, and AudioKinetic (which controls 65% gaming audio market) agreement for game developers to be able to produce D-BOX haptic content. This is the right direction - game & movie people should have access to this. Remember before Apple start to be winning market share? They had to get APP developers (tools, conferences, etc) first.

This is a smart CEO talking about top notch strategy. Now it's a matter of execution. Go D-BOX!

**And the rest**

Full disclosure: I bought a sizable amount of DBO shares recently (Feb 2021). Prior to the investment, I was looking around for information about its business, but all I could find was the financial statement (up to Dec 2020, their financial Q3) and some high level description with logs of graphics on its ‚Äúabout us‚Äù page. From these, I didn‚Äôt find much positive information about its outlook:

**Leadership changes**

S√©bastien Mailhot as the new President and CEO since Apr 1, 2020. In Feb, there were two new appointments to the Board of Directors.

**Some Financials**

The company was on a good trajectory at end of 2019. Pandemic changed a lot of things since.

4.8 mln in cash at end of 2020, burning at \~3.7 mln per year (2020). It did secure a 4mln loan from National Bank in 2020 and used it to repay long term debt immediately.

Compared to 2019 (19mln), the 2020 9 month revenue number (8.1 mln) isn‚Äôt that bad, all things considered.

On Feb 17, company announced overnight marketed equity offering at C$0.13. Even the over-allotment was fully exercised. Company raised C$5.75 mln.

**Product**

Its biggest revenue comes from the ‚Äútheatre seats that move‚Äù. Depending on the film, feedbacks are mixed. There are a lot of theatres (720 screens in 40 countries) with D-BOX seats. On May 26 Cinemark signed deal to get 8 additional screens equipped (total 99). DBOX gets a cut from the ticket sales.

Its commercial entertainment & simulation products enjoy favorable comments from multiple gaming product reviewers and are considered the go-to for the best seats and cockpits for game/racing simulation. There‚Äôs no problem with performance of their products ‚Äì they rock. Price point is quite high and not a lot of people have the space and budget for one.

The announcement in Sep 2020 of partnership with Jaymar to produce D-BOX seats for the home. This ‚Äúhome‚Äù version is definitely the right direction to get into living rooms. A $3699 US price tag is not a cheap one, but much easier to consider than their pricy race simulation products.

**Thoughts**

Countries will be coming out of pandemic and resuming activities within a few more quarters. People will look for experiences that they have been deprived of. A good immersive experience at theatres, or a similar experience at home are going to make some good money. D-BOX is in a position to benefit from both.",nlmavr,"D-BOX $DBO.TO (ASK @ C$0.105): a mini DD, no DCF"
856,,2021-05-26 17:33:45,t3_nlmn2v,,pennystocks,"Hey guys - back with some DD on a new company (thanks to some players on the CSE forum) I've been following for the past few months - **BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO ($CRFT).** The company was previously Pasha Brands, which was a trash pump and dump designed for an acquisition in 2019 (which fell through), and now they're rebuilding with some pretty amazing assets in hand. Take a look. **Full disclosure: I bought $5200 at 3.5c and 4c because I think it's going to rip. Already up 12.5% today.**

**SUMMARY:**

There have been a bunch of companies that were raided by corporate pirates and robbed of the opportunity to win in the Canadian cannabis market in 2018/2019. We know the story - corporate and IR teams come in, do a pump and dump with existing assets and try to make an acquisition play. That‚Äôs what happened with CRFT. Their old CEO, Patrick Brauckmann did a P/D post IPO. Got it up to very high levels (didn‚Äôt raise at these levels) but rather sold off stock and the company crashed.

These guys are undergoing a re-org to re-position themselves away from Pasha Brands with a legitimate business model. 

**MY RATIONALE:**

&#x200B;

* First off, there's **massive      IR exposure** and a great story to tell to the markets ‚Äì this will move      the needle even before sales volumes as it's such a good story. They just      acquired AVA Pathways, a mushrooms research company to add that to the      investor story to play with $TRIP $MMED $CYBN and $CMPS.
* The company is broken out      into 3 different decisions, **with serious assets in play**
   * Cannabis in Canada (BC       Craft Supply, Meddcann Health Products)
   * Cannabis in the USA (Feel       well Brands)
   * Psychedelics in Canada (AVA       Pathways) markets.
* They have licenses and      facilities ‚Äì ASSETS at the end of the day. Things that can be sold if      needed. They're currently doing a $2m renovation on their facility in      Chemainus, and that's only 1/4 assets, and the stock market cap is only      $6M. **So undervalued right now.**
* **Redemption story** ‚Äì CEO Matt Watters      (previously CBD Therapeutics) coming back on board to right the ship. CFO      Regan McGrath is also very bright. The management team looks solid and I      vetted the major players with my network. Checks out.
* **Social cause** ‚Äì BC Craft is a gateway for      black market growers to get back into legal cannabis. There‚Äôs a lot here      that nobody is talking about with regards to bridging the gap for the      legacy market. Bringing the black market and making them be able to      compete with the regular market is a huge advantage and will rally a lot      of social support behind the company.
* **Proven access to funding** ‚Äì they just did a raise ‚Äì      deep connections to industry.
* **Stock at all-time lows ($0.045)** ‚Äì trading under asset value      given what they've paid.
* **Insider filings show all      insiders with options and warrants at +10c. Many at 12c/20c/28c**. They have an incentive to      build the stock from these levels ‚Äì 4/5c is extremely low in my opinion.      All of my plays are like this ‚Äì undervalued companies trying to get back      on track.
* Already successfully      launched Grizzlers pre-rolls into multiple markets with Alberta already      live, and Ontario, Quebec orders confirmed.
* They have licenses and      facilities ‚Äì ASSETS at the end of the day. Things that can be sold if      needed. They're currently doing a $2m renovation on their facility in      Chemainus, and that's only 1/4 assets, and the stock market cap is only      $6M. **So undervalued right now.**

**Take a look at these guys - with a new team, a new board, and a new name - I honestly think this is a MAJOR opportunity, especially as the USA legalizes. Canada cannabis, USA cannabis and CBD, and Canada psychedelics. CRFT has it all!!**",nlmn2v,TAKE A LOOK AT BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO ($CRFT)

To my surprise there‚Äôs not really a dedicated subreddit for junior mining companies, so here‚Äôs hoping to get a little discussion going here perhaps. 

I‚Äôve made this move for two reasons. First, resource mining has always performed well during inflationary periods, so I figured why not? Secondly, I‚Äôve just found I enjoy speculating on JMCs rather than anything else I‚Äôve tried. I consider myself an avid rabbit-holer and I enjoy deep dives into companies fundamentals, and I mean deeeep. Like actually reading the 10-k/10-q filings. I do so to hedge against my anxiety that comes from speculating on such companies in the first place lol.

‚Ä¢ Secondly, It owns 100% interest in the Golden Chest Mine that consists of 25 patented mining claims covering an area of 280 acres and 90 unpatented claims mine covering an area of 1,390 acres. The mine is in production and they have their own mill to process the ore.

‚Ä¢ In recent news they just discovered a significant gold-quartz vein within one of their patented lands. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-mining-co-discovers-significant-123000589.html

‚Ä¢  They also had a favorable Q1 of 2021 where revenue increased however gross profit was down due to a rare high wind storm power outage and equipment repairs which were delayed due to shipping delays of replacement parts. They made significant advances in drilling and ore tonnage.  I believe that despite the loss they will come through strong in the subsequent quarters.

Today's news....

**The clients referred to in this release have over 27,000 patients who will be onboarded within the next 12 months, generating $16.2M USD in recurring annual revenue at full deployment. This announcement clearly demonstrates the significant, rapid growth Reliq expects to achieve through the remainder of 2021 and beyond.**  


**Reliq Health Technologies, Inc. Announces that it has Resumed Onboarding at Remote Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers as US COVID Cases Drop**

**HAMILTON, ON, May 26, 2021 / - Reliq Health Technologies Inc. (TSXV:RHT or OTC:RQHTF or WKN:A2AJTB)** (‚Äú**Reliq**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù), a rapidly growing global telemedicine company that develops innovative Virtual Care solutions for the multi-billion dollar Healthcare market, today announced that it has resumed onboarding with Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers thanks to the significantly reduced COVID numbers in the US.

‚ÄúRemote Health Clinics (RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) were on the front lines during the pandemic, providing COVID testing, treatment, and more recently serving as COVID vaccination sites for local communities‚Äù, said Dr. Lisa Crossley, CEO of Reliq Health Technologies. ‚ÄúThere are over 4,500 RHCs and FQHCs across the US. Remote Health Clinics provide primary care services to Medicare patients in rural and underserved or ‚Äúshortage‚Äù areas. Federally Qualified Health Centers provide both primary care and dental care services to rural, urban and shortage areas. After pausing onboarding at our RHC and FQHC client sites at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, we are now pleased to announce that onboarding has resumed with these clients. We expect to onboard over 27,000 RHC and FQHC patients over the next 12 months. These healthcare organizations will be using Reliq‚Äôs Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), Chronic Care Management (CCM), Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) and Transitional Care Management services to help improve patient health outcomes and enhance access to care. We expect to generate an average revenue of $50 USD per patient per month with these clinics.‚Äù

Additional News**:**  


**Adding FHIR capabilities gives the company a key competitive advantage in the community healthcare market. As national managed care plans, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage programs rush to comply with the new CMS regulations to be enforced starting July 1st, Reliq is uniquely positioned to help these large-scale enterprises satisfy the new interoperability requirements.**  


**Reliq Health Technologies, Inc. Announces Implementation of FHIR Standard for Interoperability to Address New CMS Regulations, Hires New Chief Technology & Innovation Officer**

**HAMILTON, ON, April 28, 2021 / - Reliq Health Technologies Inc. (TSXV:RHT or OTC:RQHTF or WKN:A2AJTB)** (‚Äú**Reliq**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù), a rapidly growing global telemedicine company that develops innovative Virtual Care solutions for the multi-billion dollar Healthcare market, today announced that it has adopted the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for its iUGO Care platform to meet the needs of large-scale enterprise clients such as managed care plans and other payers, who must comply with new CMS regulations for interoperability.

‚ÄúIncorporating the FHIR standard into our platform allows Reliq to offer current and prospective clients cutting edge interoperability capabilities‚Äù said Dr. Lisa Crossley, CEO of Reliq Health Technologies, Inc. ‚ÄúIn December 2020 the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule, which would require CMS-regulated payers to adopt the FHIR standard. ¬†FHIR is essentially a standardized framework for healthcare data exchange which CMS has adopted in order to improve communication between diverse healthcare information systems, and to streamline Prior Authorization processes to ensure in advance that patients are eligible (and providers will therefore be reimbursed) for any services to be provided. This proposed rule builds on the existing CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, which will be enforced by CMS as of July 1, 2021. Under these new interoperability standards, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) managed plans, State Medicaid and Qualified Health Plans (QHP) are required to use the FHIR standard to enable seamless data exchange between providers, payers and patients. Our new patient portal leverages the FHIR standard to provide patients on the iUGO Care platform with secure, seamless access to their healthcare data in accordance with the new regulations. Implementing FHIR significantly expands the Company‚Äôs total addressable market, allowing Reliq to work directly with large-scale enterprise clients such as managed care plans, private insurers and other payers as well as healthcare providers.‚Äù

The Company also announced that it has hired Dave McKay in the newly created position of Chief Technology & Innovation Officer. Mr. McKay has over 30 years of experience in Software Development and brings significant expertise in healthcare technology, cybersecurity, privacy and product innovation to Reliq. His experience in developing enterprise-level solutions for the healthcare market will be invaluable to the Company as it executes on its strategy to rapidly scale its business over the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company would also like to announce that it has eliminated the positions of Chief Technology Officer and Chief Innovation Officer, previously held by Rob Prouse and Bassma Ghali, respectively, and wishes to thank both Mr. Prouse and Dr. Ghali for their contributions to date. Mr. McKay will assume the responsibilities previously associated with these two roles.

867,,2021-05-26 22:10:02,t3_nlstsp,,pennystocks,"This is an interesting one and I am NOT recommending taking a position.

Lizhi has some fascinating technicals, trading at around 5.30 in August of last year, the stock continued to dip to lows of 2.28 until October, where it suddenly spiked to 4.75 before closing the day at 3.15.

This pattern repeated, spiking from 2.36 to 5.91 in December, before closing the day at 4.79, bleeding down to 3.35.

1st of Feb 2021 is where things went wild, with the stock soaring up from 3.30 to an ATH of 16.75.

Over the next month, they plummeted to 6.75, before spiking up to 15 again and then DOWN DOWN DOWN all the way to 4.23.

Today they spiked from 4.34 to a high of 8 before emptying out to 6.84 at close.

This company has had consistently negative earnings, negative EPS, negative EBITDA.  A market cap of 342M with an EV of -147.6M.

Earnings are coming up on the 1st of June and I can't see them having ever reported a successful quarter. I'm picking up as many puts as I can afford to see where this goes as I'm not feeling at all bullish, but I might pick up a call to make some money from whatever insanity will happen over the next few days.  Buyer/Seller beware.",nlstsp,Watch out for a potential P&D in LIZI
868,,2021-05-26 23:20:00,t3_nlu9di,,pennystocks,"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today‚Äôs price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today‚Äôs price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley discusses the future integration of Ford's electric vehicles.
Demand for Ford's electric F-150 Lightning is getting hotter, according to CEO Jim Farley. 


""I am happy to report and this is just in, after about a week of orders we have 70,000,"" Farley revealed during a Wednesday appearance on The Claman Countdown. He noted the automaker wanted this version of the F-150 to ""challenge convention"" for the line, which is already the nation's best-selling truck.

Reservations for the F-150 Lightning only require a $100 refundable deposit and deliveries aren't scheduled to begin until spring of 2022. The full-size truck has a starting price of $39,974 (not including delivery fees) and qualifies for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit. A fully-loaded Platinum trim luxury version is currently listed at an estimated price of $90,474, as previously reported by FOX Business.

Take for example a ‚Äúholding company‚Äù that focuses on say, cookies.  They don‚Äôt make cookies.  They don‚Äôt sell cookies.  They own other businesses that might make or sell or market or write blogs about cookies.  Or eat cookies.

993,,2021-05-27 08:23:48,t3_nm2sav,,pennystocks,"Yesterday's OCUP webinar focused on eye doctors giving their input on the product. I wouldn't read to much into their praising because obviously they were not invited by Ocuphire to speak negatively about the pipeline. 

**But, I would highlight the following:**

1. The professionals were under the impression that t**he market for Ocuphire's Nyxol is larger than anticipated,** up to three time as much.

2. Everyone **agreed that there is strong demand for a product such as Nyxol**, which currently does not exist.

3. They all **seemed eager to see it being launched**.

4. An important note: the product is necessary and advantageous enough that, when asked, all eye doctors agreed **they would gladly take the expense of the product upon themselves** and not pass the cost on to clients. 

What was more interesting about the webinar was the timeline and the results so far.

**In terms of results so far**: Excellent all around results on a phase 3 trial (the last phase before requesting approval from the FDA). Meeting the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints with flying colors. 

Or, translated into what we really care about: Ocuphire and the FDA get together before a phase 3 trial, and establish, together, what is the main objective, the main result, the trial needs to achieve. 

Ultimately it's the FDA who set this objective (the primary endpoint). And that objective was met, and then some. The FDA also set, together with Ocuphire, some secondary objectives. Other goals the trial needs to reach to be deemed successful. 

One very important secondary endpoint, or additional goal, was to check the safety. Side effects, etc. Here also, the results were excellent.

So in terms of **so far, we have a product that has passed the most important test, and received very high grades** on it. Considering this is a product that has no rivals and serves as a solution for a problem that currently has no solution, it's excellent news. 

**As for the timeline**, which is critical: We have two things to look at:

1. When is revenue coming

2. What can influence stock price until then

So, Ocuphire has 4 trials currently at different stages, including the all important very last trial for Nyxol/Mydriasis. It is safe to expect very good news from at least 3 of these 4 because they are all based on the same product that has been successful all along. 

Therefore, during 2021 we can expect several milestones that can influence the price as the approval stages get closer.  During 2022 we can expect a confirmation that the product has succeeded in all trials and will be presented for FDA approval.

**Revenue is coming in 2023**. I'm guessing 2nd half. This is important because one fellow reddit asked about the risk of stock dilution to finance all these trials, etc.

Personally, I think that the question of financing might be something to reckon with down the road. It's a valid point we need to keep an eye open to it. I don't think it's an immediate concern. This company is small and its expenses right now are manageable. There is also a lot of interest in their product and I think they can get additional financing if needed. 

To me it seems the strategy I'd go with would be to wait for this to double in price and then take the profits and re-evaluate. I really think this is going to 10 sometime this year as a result of multiple good news.  With an FDA approval in early 2023 this goes through the roof like a rocket, no doubt. But I would consider getting out with a sizeable again, and buying again at a dip.
