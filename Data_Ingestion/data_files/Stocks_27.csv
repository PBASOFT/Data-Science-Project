Your perspective is little different from which you disagree with, and has to be noted that neither belongs to a serious investor.

Investing, like any other activity you do purposefully, should be taken seriously.
You don’t go to college thinking you won’t learn anything. Don’t apply for a job expecting to get fired. Investing is no different, if you take it as a serious endeavor.

The mindset of failure justifies who is just out for the excitement and fun, pass some time, gamble and maybe win something nice. Comparing it to a vacation underscores a perspective to play for enjoyment rather than work for productivity.

The idea to “invest only what you can lose”, while correct in a sense, for hobbyists traders is often layered on top of a superficial attitude. It becomes about as useful as an advice to try controlling one’s gambling addiction.",,

Given that commercial fusion will be at least 10 years after it is, your looking at least 15-25 years barring any major breakthroughs. It's planned first operation is 2035 and that's literally the first operation reaction. 

the world's first fission station, Calder Hall in the UK, was commsioned in 1956. So assuming that fusion is on the same timescale your looking at mid 2040s probably. That is also assuming you can even invest. ITER is in France, where the energy company is state owned (84.5%) meaning that initally you won't be able to invest in fusuon in europe initially.

> Apple also manages good returns despite having a horrible market share for computers, yet profitable.

Apple's returns come from their sticky products and software revenues, exactly the same business model Tesla is going after. On the other hand, Tesla is exactly the opposite of Apple. Apple is the premium brand with great products, but much worse specs than the competition for a higher price. Tesla is the premium brand with great products, but much better specs than the competition for the same price.

> Tesla for one has had a few good years with minimal competition and easy life, though nowadays everyone is going electric and fast!

This is an easy way to make it sound like that would be terrible for Tesla, but it only matters if others are actually making better cars, which they are not.

> Tesla has been unable to keep their lead in both technology, car quality or marketshare.

Let's break them down one by one:

* Tesla is clearly still miles ahead in terms of technology. Anyone who's serious can see that, but in case you're somehow to blinded by misinformation to realize this just look at the fact that the Cybertruck beats the electric Hummer and F150 in every single spec for the same price.
* Tesla has never been in the lead in terms of car quality, but they've been rapidly increasing their car quality and have already jumped ahead in some areas this year, with the single-piece casting of the underbody and their superior electrical wiring for example.
* Market share is largely irrelevant, as no company can maintain their market share when their market had no other brands competing before to lots of people competing today. As long as Tesla is selling every car they make, what matters is not their EV market share but their overall automotive market share, and here Tesla is still rapidly gaining ground.

> Their cars are getting more problems and start to get a tarnished reputation (the other day they had their own ""battery gate"").

This is absolute BS. Tesla has had negative press from the start and it's not getting better or worse, it's just misinformation from media that want to tarnish Tesla's reputation because they don't do advertising and they'll hurt the media's business model if they succeed. Stories like the ""failing brakes"" in China recently are quickly proven false, but the stories stick because people are more interested in negative stories than positive. Ultimately this doesn't matter though, as people will realize they're BS when they hear from friends and families how great their Tesla is.

> Their driving assistance has not outperformed the competition in any test done by a objective third party, on the contrary.

Completely false. While their are some third parties that are funded by other brands (such as Consumer Reports which is largely funded by Ford) and naturally lean towards the companies funding them, the actually independent parties all rank Tesla's driving assistance as the best, although it's often masked by bringing other factors into the overall scoring to make Tesla not the overall winner (again because of the advertising argument).

> And their marketshare in Europe in general and Norway in particular is deep red.

Cherry picking one continent or even country is extremely shady, especially because Tesla doesn't even have a factory in Europe yet.

> Elon going to China to try to butter up Xi Jinping by praising the dictator is a show of fear.

Lol, extremely subjective speculation...

> Tesla is bleeding in Europe, they need a new market...one with less competitors

Already answered this. Total bs as long as they're selling every car they make and scaling like crazy.",,

Fission would go public sooner strictly because they have more issues getting funding. Imo fission has more potential, but the main downside of any reactor is people dont understand how it works so they're afraid of it.  It only makes sense to use them for a large city but the citizens dont want it near the large city. They've done the numbers, having to move it away x miles away from city expands costs considerably and makes it an iffy break even proposition.  If you see one company making one huge reactor with plans to serve multiple cities through it I think you might have a winner. Anything else is kind of thinking too small thinking imo. 

I dont think either of these are in our near future but without some sort of new energy source were going to need something other than wind farms and solar farms. I dont think people understand how much energy they use.  If you do find one publicly traded let me know. I love the idea personally.",,

I need to keep looking at the automotive retailer market, but I'm beginning to think higher debt ratios might be part and parcel.  Which does make some sense with the higher (and high value) inventories they have to manage.  In Lithia Motors case, they're obviously heavily invested in acquisitions, which can further drive that debt level higher.

You might have to postpone the house purchase for a couple of years while you regrow your down payment money.

It's true that keeping a large chunk of money in a savings account with a near-zero interest rate for a few years is suboptimal because it will lose value as a result of inflation, but you also have no worries about how much money will be available when it's needed.

Let’s say Apple did a 4:1 split. It’s now a $25 stock that pays a $0.50 dividend, you own 4 shares.

After dividend reinvestment you will have 4.08 shares worth of Apple.

You can justify ICLN as necessary, but many others see a basket of companies that are in a highly competitive, high capital, low margin, low/no cash flows, low moat industry that is also currently undergoing disruption.  Yes, some of these companies have great ideas, but as we pivot away from fossil fuels, it’s very likely these current technologies get disrupted themselves.  Given the previous statement about the industry, it’s very possible many perform poorly or go bankrupt even with a few winners.

For example if experience taught an investor that TSMC (Taiwanese semiconductor stock) is driven by Tech, tension between US-China, news on Taiwan and consumer behaviour narratives then we can point our model to those narratives in our dataset and it can learn to predict stock prices from those narratives. So it can learn for example if there is tension on Taiwan how that relates to future prices. In case someone has narratives they want to test (eg Oil, Middle-east, economy for the price of ExxonMobil) let me know and I will run the model and share the output dashboard.*

Example output: [https://imgur.com/gGwFWPw](https://imgur.com/gGwFWPw) (real dashboard is interactive but it is on a private server and im not sure whether its allowed to share the link)

&#x200B;

Alternative data and Machine Learning are gaining rapid traction in the investment industry. However AI and Machine learning still is not able to beat the market or most regular investors in a real life environment, even though the internet is full of articles predicting stock prices with 99% accuracy (overfitting is no joke). One can safely say there are domains where humans outperform AI and there are domains where it is the other way around. This also goes for investing. But why only use either human input or AI input when you can also combine them?

In this post Ill try to explain how we build a model that uses both human intuition and AI in analysing the stock market, as well as some examples on how it works in practice. This will be followed up by more elaborate examples in subsequent articles. As said in case someone has a narrative they want to test let me know.

**Where humans have the edge over AI— developing investment narratives**

Academics are becoming increasingly convinced that narratives play a key role in explaining stock price movements (eg Robert Shiller — Narrative Economics, Andrew Lo-Adaptive Markets). Not so strange if you think about it, people have been storytellers for thousands of years and our brains are hardwired to build a narrative for everything we experience. The best stock pickers in the world are using narratives to make their plays, only they call their narratives investment theses, scenario’s or bets. The famous play George Soros made against the Bank of England basically was betting on a narrative, namely the narrative that the Bank of England would be able to keep supporting the British pound. Similarly tension in oil producing countries are narratives that move the price of ExxonMobil. Or narratives what the FED will do will move the entire SP500. Essentially when you start to think about it, narratives really matter.

&#x200B;

Humans are way better than AI in and telling stories and recognizing stories. A five year old can tell a coherent story whereas even the most sophisticated AI (eg GPT -3) still struggles with telling a random story, let alone recognizing one. Ask an investor what narrative will affect the stock price of Microsoft and he will instantly have some idea that it relates to tech, working from home (and therefore Covid developments) and cloud computing. AI does not have that intuition.

**Where AI has the edge over humans — data and patterns**

Humans can see the big picture, but AI can spot the details, and it can do it better and faster. I can write an AI script in one hour that can beat any human at the “Find Wally” game, no matter if they are trained to do it for decades. Similarly I can (and I did) write an AI script that is able to monitor any desired narrative. And where the average investor might be able to crunch several news sources per day, AI can monitor thousands within minutes. Moreover we programmed our AI to pick up meaningful and small differences in nuance of specific narratives that humans cannot detect. Additionally AI can assess whether narratives are discussed in a positive or negative tone. In this way we can see whether negative sentiment is developing on oil, or positive sentiment on interest rates, or controversy around working from home, or fear of negative economic data, or an increase in bullish sentiment within the manufacturing sector, or on any other narrative one can think of.

Let humans find the narrative and let AI find the pattern

Having established all that we set out to build a model where humans can supply the narrative (whether that is an investment thesis, stress-scenario or monitoring the new hype sector) and AI. Below is a brief explanation of the steps taken to build a narrative model, followed by an exemplary case study/example.

&#x200B;

**Human input** → Which narratives are suspected to drive price. Experienced investors generally have a good sense on what news or narratives drive price. We can use this information to feed in to our model (see also the real life example further on).

**Narrative-investing.io** **model AI input** → deduce narrative time series from our alternative dataset (Financial Tweets, Financial headlines, Financial subreddits). This is done by:

\- Using our customized algorithm to assign a narrative to each headline or Tweet

\- Determine for each relevant headline (i.e. that is related to the narrative) its sentiment, emotional value etc by using a Machine Learning based sentiment/emotion classifier.

**Narrative-investing.io** **model AI input** → Analyse which narrative exposures are most important in explaining future price. We feed (lagged) price and our narrative time series to our model. From this our model can be trained on what narrative series are most important in explaining future price movements.

**Narrative-investing.io** **model AI input** → Having established a model we continuously keep monitoring how narratives develop and how this would influence future price movements. We do this by setting up a dashboard with all relevant metrics.

We did this by leveraging our inhouse dataset of news websites, financial tweets and Reddit data. As with all things in live, it helps to describe this with an example;

**A real life example**

The investors’ intuition — Eg I know an investor in the semiconductor industry. Many years of experience taught him that the semiconductor industry is sensitive to various domains/narratives, from which he gave the following as input to our model:

\- Taiwan → Taiwan is one of the main semiconductor producing regions. Uncertainty on that region seems to affect the semiconductor market.

\- China US tension → Related to above, if there is tension between US and China it increases tension with respect to Taiwan.

\- Consumer → Consumers create demand for semiconductors. Positive narratives on consumers influence the semiconductor market.

\- Tech → Tech is heavily dependent on semiconductors and positive narratives on is reflected in the semiconductor market.

\- Economic factors → Finally all general economic narratives are also at play for the semiconductor business. So FED policy, investors emotions and all other economic related narratives are taken in to account.

The narrative time series— From the ideas investors have we can let AI determine narrative time series from our alternative dataset of millions of tweets and headlines. We plotted a subset of our narratives against the stock market returns of TSMC stock (a large semiconductor company). Already you see there is some relation.

&#x200B;

Example of a narrative time series vs stock returns, see dashboard middle right chart ([https://imgur.com/gGwFWPw](https://imgur.com/gGwFWPw))

Determining the most important narratives — From all narratives given we can let our model analyse which narratives are most important for (future) returns.

&#x200B;

Most important narratives for TSM returns see dashboard middle chart ([https://imgur.com/gGwFWPw](https://imgur.com/gGwFWPw))

Here you see the top 10 most important narratives. For TSM this means that when consumer news gets more exposure that is an important indicator for future price. Almost as important as the sentiment on news on Taiwan (second row). This in turn is followed by negative exposure of consumer headlines.

Monitoring narratives and run predictions — All these metrics (and many more) are then continuously updated on our dashboard. In this way the investors intuition can be quantified and monitored. Our engine and AI model is able to build time series for any narrative so all of our dashboard are unique and tailormade to the need of the investor or client. It helps them leveraging all their years of experience and intuition by means of our dataset and AI analyses.

&#x200B;

This in a nutshell explains how we tried to build a model that offers the best of both worlds, human intuition combined with the rigor and insight from AI. There are a lot more use cases for this model (spoiler, scenarios analyses, trend watching, theme investing) but for know this more than enough reading material I guess;)",nlhbrq,I build a model that supplements stock market investors’ intuition with big data and AI

# The Income Statement

**What is it?**

The income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements you’ll come across. It’s also known as the profit and loss  (P&L) statement, summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis, often shared as quarterly and annual reports.

**What is its purpose?**

The function of an income statement is to show a company’s financial performance over the period of analysis.

**What is inside an income statement?**

* **Revenue:** The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period
* **Expenses:** The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period
* **Costs of goods sold (COGS):** The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells
* **Gross profit:** Total revenue less COGS
* **Operating income:** Gross profit less operating expenses
* **Income before taxes:** Operating income less non-operating expenses
* **Net income:** Income before taxes less taxes
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares
* **Depreciation:** The extent to which assets (for example, aging equipment) have lost value over time
* **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization

>*These items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a company’s reporting and accounting policies.*

**Classifying Expenses**

**There are three different types of expenses**

**1.** **Operating Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associate with the operations of the business.**b.** Direct costs of producing the product/service and other expenses associated with production, including SG&A expenses.

**2.** **Financing Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associated with the use on non-equity financing.**b.** Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt.

**3.** **Capital Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses that provide benefits over many years.**b.** For a manufacturing company these can be plant & equipment.**c.** For non-manufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible forms.

**Their Placement**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/WCDqBee*](https://imgur.com/WCDqBee)  
>  
>📌 **SUMMARY:**  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business, financing  expenses with non-equity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years.

Revenue Recognition

For  most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a  product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues. For firms that  sell products or services over many years (eg. subscriptions) it becomes  trickier.

**Under ASC 606 (new revenue recognition standard):**

* The  new model’s core principle for revenue recognition is to “depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.”
* Thus,  for a real estate developer working on a multi-year construction,  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses, and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years, performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized.

>**📌  SUMMARY: For most firms, when a product or service is sold, it is  recorded as revenues. For firms that deal with long term contracts,  memberships, subscriptions etc. revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration - eg. $120,000 for 1 year of service = $10,000/month recorded  revenue.**

Revenue breakdowns

As companies enter **multiple businesses and different geographies**, it is useful to know **where they generate their revenues.**

**Where** are **geographic breakdowns found?**

* While the breakdown can **sometimes** by provided in **income statements**, they are more likely to be part of the **footnotes to the financial statements.**
* Companies generally break down ***revenues by geography***, though the degree of detail can vary.
* Companies also break down ***revenues by business segment***, though there is an element of **subjectivity to the segment categorization.**

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies generally **break down revenues by geography** with a varying degree of detail and **revenues by business segments**  subjective to the segment categorization. Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement, but generally they are found in the **footnotes of the financial statements.**

Operating expenses: Breakdown

Operating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues, i.e. cost of goods  sold, and expenses that are related to operations, but which are not as  directly tied to revenues.

**How** are operating expense broken down?

1. Expenses directly **related to the production** of goods / services that **increase revenues.** These are **netted out** form **revenues to get gross profits.**
2. Expenses related to operations, not directly tied to revenues. These are **netted out** from **gross profits to get operating income.**

**SG&A Costs**

1. In many companies, the **largest** **non-operating expense is S, G & A**, a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies **break down revenues** by how they **relate to production** or **operations.** The **former tied to the increase of revenues,** the **latter not.**

Depreciation

There are three forms of depreciation; **economic, accounting & tax depreciation.**

1. **Economic Depreciation**

This reflects the **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** It requires nuance, and will vary across even the same type of assets, depending on how it is used.

2. **Accounting Depreciation**

This is more mechanical and is **driven largely by the aging of the asset**, with the differences often being in whether it happens **uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated.**

3. **Tax Depreciation**

This reflects what the tax authorities will allow as **depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Economic** depreciation reflects **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** **Accounting** depreciation is **driven by the aging of an asset,** **depending** if it occurs **over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period.** **Tax** depreciation reflects **what authorities allow as depreciation** for purposes of **computing taxable income.**

Financial expenses

The most common financial expense is **interest expense on debt**, either in the form of bank loans or corporate bonds.

**Some interest expense is implicit**

As accountants classify other **commitments (such as leases) as debt, some of the interest expense is implicit**, i.e., it is calculated by accountants **based upon their assessment** of the **debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.**

**If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

In some companies, **interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings** and **financial investments**, and **reported as a net interest expense**. If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Most **common financial expense is interest expense on debt**, either **bank loans or corporate bonds.** Accountants classify **other commitments (leases etc.) as debt,** making some **interest  expense implicit and calculated based on their assessment of debt  equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.** Some companies net out interest expense against interest income earned on cash holdings and financial investments. If **interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

Income from non-operating investments

Income  earned from cash & marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companies.

**Cash & Marketable Securities**

**Income earned on cash holdings** (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be **reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses.**

**Cross holdings** in other companies

* Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding:
* When you hold a (**small or minority**) portion of **another company,** the **income** from that holding will **usually be reported in the income statement.**
* If you hold a **majority stake of another company**, you will generally **have to consolidate your financials.** You will **count 100% of the subsidiary’s revenues,** **operating expenses and operating income as your own.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Income earned** on **cash holdings** will be reported either as a s**tand alone income or netted against interest expenses. Income** earned from **minority stake** in a company will usually be reported in the **income statement.** If you hold a **majority  stake of another company, you will consolidate 100% of it's revenues,  operating expenses and operation income as your own.**

Extraordinary Income/Expenses

As the term implies, extraordinary income and expenses are designed to capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations.**

**Extraordinary** items include:

* **One-time expense or gain** from **sale of assets or divisions**
* **Write offs or charges** associated with **past project, lawsuits or fines**
* **Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions** in the **past**

**Truly extraordinary** items:

* If an item is **truly extraordinary**, it should show up **infrequently** and the amount associated with it **should vary**.

>**📌 SUMMARY: Extraordinary** items and expenses capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations**. If an item shows up **regularly and consistently, it is not extraordinary.**

Income Statement Analysis

There are **two** **methods** to read and analyze financial documents: **vertical and horizontal analysis.**

**Vertical Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/tsbdF73*](https://imgur.com/tsbdF73)

This  method of analysis, as the name suggests, is top – down. You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentage.

This type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries, and between companies, because you can  see relative  proportions. It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improving.

Vertical analysis isn’t  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis, but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked,  such as: *Where did costs rise or fall? What line items are contributing most to profit margins? How are they affected over time?*

**E.g** – here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by side

**Horizontal Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y*](https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y)

This method of analysis focuses on **year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) performance.**

Horizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It improves the review  of a  company’s consistency over time, as well as its growth compared to   competitors.

Because of this,  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts. By  conducting a horizontal analysis, you can tell what’s been  driving an  organization’s financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns, line item by line item. Ultimately,  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over time—comparisons  from Q1 to  Q2, for example—instead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to others.

**To perform horizontal analysis you:**

1. Take the value of Period N
2. Divide it by the value of Period N-1
3. Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage change

>**E.g –** ***Revenue in 2017 was $4,000 and in 2016 it was $3,000. The YoY change in revenue is $4000/$3000 – 1 = 33%.***",nlhcci,Accounting 101 - Part 1: The Income Statement

Suppose instead of buying properties directly, you invested in REITs(which have their own leverage internally) via Vanguard's VNQ, but didn't use any margin/leverage yourself to buy them. Worst case scenario, If you bought right at the very peak, and panic sold right at the very bottom, you would've lost 75% on price. In practice it would've been a bit lower due to dividends, maybe 65-70%.

622,,2021-05-26 13:59:44,t3_nlhpv3,,stocks," LONDON — A Dutch court on Wednesday ruled oil giant [Royal Dutch Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDS.A) must reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

That’s a much higher reduction than the company’s current aim of lowering its emissions by 20% by 2030.

Shell’s current [climate strategy](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/our-climate-target/_jcr_content/par/relatedtopics.stream/1621314462494/d53de79d4e951642456e928cdfd18b0a1867cf4d/our-climate-target.pdf) states that the company is aiming to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050, with the company setting a target of cutting its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2035.

CNBC contacted Shell to request a comment on the ruling.

Shares of Shell were trading 0.3% lower in London. The stock price is up almost 10% year-to-date, having tumbled nearly 40% in 2020.

The lawsuit was filed in April 2019 by seven activist groups — including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace — on behalf of 17,200 Dutch citizens. Court summons claimed [Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDSA-GB)’s business model “is endangering human rights and lives” by posing a threat to the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement.

Under the Paris Agreement — a landmark deal adopted in 2015 and signed by 195 countries — nations agreed to a framework to prevent global temperatures from rising by any more than 2 degrees Celsius, although the accord aims to prevent global temperature rises exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At Shell’s annual general meeting last week, shareholders [voted overwhelmingly in favor](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/shell-secures-backing-for-climate-strategy-but-growing-minority-rebel.html) of the company’s energy transition plans — but, crucially, a growing minority rejected the strategy, insisting the oil giant needed to do much more in the fight against climate change.

Activist investor Follow This said at the time that the result was likely to mean Shell would have to revise its climate targets once again.

According to Reuters, the case is the first in which activists have taken a major energy firm to court to compel it to overhaul its climate strategy.

When the lawsuit was filed, a lawyer acting on behalf of environmental groups said the case would “raise the pressure” on other fossil fuel companies.

* The FTSE Global All Cap Index is great. I recommend it for anyone that just want's to set and forget and never worry about anything at all, it's a very fine choice.
* I am not trying to exactly recreate the worldwide stock market but balance it out with a small emphasis on gdp. However I don't want to fully recreate the world economy only by gdp, so I am going for less than the overweight [56%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710680/global-stock-markets-by-country/) but more than the [16%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256381/share-of-global-regions-in-the-gross-domestic-product/)\-[24%](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-88-trillion-world-economy-in-one-chart/) (depending on calculation) of the worldwide gdp share the US holds.  


So while 47% is still relatively high overall this is more or less necessary because the US holds a large share of the publicly listed companies and is the biggest economy of the west. However I do not want to bet nearly 60% of my money on a single country, which is why I prefer to go with a 70/30 World/EM Portfolio.",,

The higher prices that they charge ostensibly cover costs with plenty to profit. Do you think they would be investing so many millions of dollars into creating this technology and developing it if they didn't have something as simple as their profit margins figured out? 

To go back to the skydiving example (which literally does include the high costs of traveling in a plane btw), it would not be profitable to charge people standard travel prices when they're cranking a high performance plane up to 10,000 feet and back multiple times a day (which is extremely taxing on the engine and airframe).

The argument I'm making is it eliminates your ability to stick with a plan. If you have a strong risk appetite, you can go 100% stocks, no bonds or cash, and that's your right. If your time horizon is 20+ years, you can literally just ignore the daily price swings because they mean nothing to you. Same with if you use your portfolio for income but have no intention of selling.

But the moment you introduce margin into your portfolio, those price swings become very relevant, and you give up control.

It's for that reason that I consider 100% equities the maximum risk exposure a retail investor should take. 

If you're comfortable taking on additional risk and want to enhance returns beyond 100% equities, IMO you'd be better off factor investing with value stocks, perhaps with weighting towards small cap, which has higher historical returns than the SP500. That would provide better risk adjusted returns than relying on margin.",,

742,,2021-05-26 14:32:17,t3_nlig9h,,stocks,"**$73 NEAR TERM PRICE TARGET**

Check  out the chart below and you tell me if you can see where this is  headed... There is next to zero resistance all the way back to the  $40-$70s trading range and shorts know it.

The massive pushes to $19 and $12 have wiped out all the previous resistance. It's about ready to explode.

A  shareholder update call has been scheduled for June 3rd at 8:30....  just 5 days prior to the annual shareholder meeting on June 8th.  Something big is coming!

**SHORT INTEREST**

Shorts  continue to double down and they are going to very a hard lesson as the  average 3 month volume has dried up. Last time it did this it ran from  $3 to $19 very fast. It's even better this time since there are over 1  million short-sold shares now and a much larger institutional ownership  percentage now.

&#x200B;

Shorts  continue to pile in even with the upcoming shareholder event on June  3rd just 5 days prior to the annual shareholder meeting.

&#x200B;

Couldn't be more perfectly setup for a massive short squeeze.

&#x200B;

75.77 Short Squeeze Score, Ranked 650 out of 6565 companies

INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER GROWTH

Big  buyers are stepping in now. Even with Vanguard Group lowering theirs  their ETF combine for 1,044,349 total shares held by vanguard. The float  is only 15 million. Sure seems like Vanguard has a lot of faith. Also  helps when you have Ikarian taking up a nice size new position, ""Ikarian  Capital is a biotech investment firm focusing on innovations in drug  discovery and development.""

745,gzindhi,2021-05-26 14:32:42,t1_gzindhi,t3_nlgtcs,stocks,"Depends what you mean by ""day trading"". Many people use this term as a synonym to mean different things.  


If you mean buy underlying stock and sell it after it goes up at least 1% on the day, you're to lose money over time. Nobody can predict the future, and nobody knows which way a stock will move on any particular day. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Putting money into a few stocks and hoping they go up on the day is no better than going to the casino and hoping the roulette wheel falls on black. You might hit, and you might hit a streak for a while, but anyone who has studied this can tell you that, statistically, you will not outperform the market over time.  


Conversely, if by ""day trading"" you mean having a lot of call/put spreads that require you to enter, roll, and close (i.e. manage) your position on a daily basis because you are adequately leveraged across dozens of stocks across many sectors, then yes you can make a reasonable and safe return on your investment on a daily basis. However, you'll need at least $1m in principal before you can make enough to replace an $80k-$100k/year full-time employment. You'll also need a great deal of patience, which most people don't have.

REITs were worse hit during the recession than the stock market and were how a lot of people got burned. The great recession basically disproved the notion of safe REITs. They recovered, sure, but not everyone could afford to wait for recovery and losing 50% of your entire net worth will cripple you if your living expenses exceed what those losses will cover.

The examples here and the whole point of the post is that panic selling isn't the only reason people end up needing to sell. Many that overextend themselves believe that in a crisis they can just pull the money out like a savings account but they fail to consider that economic crashes often result in job losses as well and don't maintain emergency liquid assets. 

Using the 50% loss model, let's say you have 50k in stocks, 5k in the bank and on average you need 8k a month for living expenses (we live in LA so 8k is a pretty normal number). Crash occurs, you lose your job and have no income coming in, and now you have 25k in stocks that won't recover for another year or more. By the end of the month you'll need to withdraw at least 3k. Even with unemployment which pays maybe 1k a month, you would need to sell nearly all your assets at a 50% loss just to stay afloat within a matter of months. When people say don't invest more than you can afford to lose this is what we're talking about. Too many people think they can afford to lose their savings because the depend on their job to continually bring in income and just assume they'll be able to make up the loss eventually.",,

CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid shares fell on a report that Amazon may open brick-and-mortar pharmacies.

The Business Insider report, which cited anonymous sources, said Amazon is considering opening standalone retail pharmacies or adding them to Whole Foods stores.

Drugstore chains have already been squeezed by more consumers buying front-of-store items online.

This is a good news as amazon continue to disrupt other industry. If amazon can add the retail pharmacies to the whole foods stores, that could attract more potential shoppers and boost whole foods stores revenue. It continue to shows that amazon want to expand into health care industry and keep diversifying the business.

898,gzisurl,2021-05-26 15:08:10,t1_gzisurl,t3_nldj8c,stocks,"You need to understand what calls/puts are first.

You are buying contracts that let you buy (sell) the stock at an agreed upon price (the strike) up until the agreed upon date (expiry). They are called derivatives because their value is derived from the price of the underlying equity these contracts denote. 

The total value of an option is the sum of its intrinsic and extrinsic values. It's intrinsic value is the different between the strike and the current price of the stock (spot price) with a minimum of 0. The extrinsic value is the value the option gets from the time left to expiry (high chance of movement and being profitable - in the money) and the volatility of the stock.

&#x200B;

Lets do an example:

Today is March 1st. 

Stock XYZ is trading for $100.

You buy 10 lots of calls on stock XYZ with strike of $120 and expiry of May 1st. The premium is $0.30.

You pay $0.30 \* 100 (each lot is for 100 shares) \* 10 (lots) = $300.00

You calls intrinsic value is $0 because your strike price is above the spot price.

The extrinsic value is $300 - all of the value of your calls is derived from the chance that 

You now own those calls that let you buy 1000 (10 \* 100) shares of XYZ by May 1st, for $120.

It is now April 1st. 

XYZ is trading for $130.

The value of your contracts is still intrinsic + extrinsic.

The intrinsic part is now $10 \* 10 \* 100 = $10,000.

The extrinsic part would be the volatility + time value.

If the volatility stayed the same, then the extrinsic would be around 1/2 (there were 2 months to expiry when you bought the calls, and one month left now).

So your options would be worth around $10,150.

You can sell those options, or you can exercise them and force the counter-party that underwrote them to sell you 10 \* 100 XYZ for $120.

&#x200B;

Hope that makes some sense.",,

1) Economic depreciation are called impairment, I never saw a FS that used the term economic depreciation from my clients. Also, I have never heard the term in my accounting classes. That said, I did not audit all the entities publicly traded so that does not mean the term is never used. I just thought I might as well share the most common term. Furthermore, an entity will register an impairment when the accounting value is higher than the fair value (either the value on the market or the estimated value as per the cash flow. That said, most of the time the two values should be about the same). 

2) PP&E, other tangible assets and intangible assets will go directly in your BS. They won't appear in your P&L, unless you are talking about depreciation. (When you mention the capital expenses)

3) for extraordinary items, I would simply add that the entity has to present them distinctly in the P&L.

They love to tell you about their big wins but leave out all then times they lost their entire initial investment.

I didn’t buy Ford but I did buy GM a while back after seeing the crazy rise of Tesla and their valuation. Turned out very well for me.

Tesla is worth 4.5 times both Ford and GM combined. That is insane. And that valuation showed every manufacturer just how valuable EV is. That showed every major owner of Ford/GM and all executives that their net worth can literally triple if they get EV right. They have logistics, distribution, and footprints that Tesla dreams about. That potential value also easily allows the manufacturers to stop handcuffing themselves to the oil and gas lobbying. Energy companies can’t sky rocket their valuation. EV can.

I can’t deny I’m starting to see Teslas on the road a lot more. But honestly, most people are buying the base model which is kind of ugly and plain when you see the real one in person. Not the add-on loaded one you see in pictures/videos. Just my opinion, not the aesthetic simplicity the likes of Apple products. The premium models are beautiful though; but overpriced.

Basically, that’s why I’m long F and GM. They are still 2-3 years out from actually selling relevant EV. But I’d expect a sharp spike when they officially announce market release of a few models. Which will happen. Hell, GM spiked after their conference announcing their EV line.",,

I'm no quantum physicist or code-monkey, just an audio engineer geek, but what little knowledge I have of quantum computers is it fixes the problem that classical computers have had from the beginning: only being truly serial binary machines. Classical computers use binary to have absolute values: 1 or 0 (1 bit). Quantum computers use quantum entanglement of laser light to create superimposed values: 1 or 0, 1 and 0, 1 and 1, 0 and 0 (1 qubit). Not many know this, but when you have Google Chrome, Steam, and Spotify all open, your computer is switching off between processing power very quickly because binary only works in 1 or 0! A quantum computer can truly actually be processing more than 1 thing at the same time, because it can be 1 or 0, 1 and 0, etc.!

Not just because vegetarien-diet is in the uprise, but because the alternatives get better and better (imo). This makes them a direct competition to the meat industry in long term, since the taste will no longer be a major differentiator in the future. 

I mean I am far for an expert and would not give my arguments too much weight , but I kind of want to be invested in one, or a few companies, that are in this branche.

I really have not thought about writing in this subreddit and just went with a stock i randomly read about. This was kind of a mistake i guess, because I invested in this stock, and since then it lost 70% of its value. 
( ""Eat Beyond Global Holdings"" is the name of the company)

In my life, I have developed a love for Restaurants. The unlimited drinks at a cheap price, the quality boneless Buffalo wings, I love it all. However, there is one thing I have noticed researching Restaurant stocks (starting with my favorite screener, Finviz): many of them are overvalued. Granted, the COVID 19 Disease has plagued and closed many restaurants; so its’ understandable if a restaurant temporarily loses money. However, if a company has little cash, negative cash flow, and a lot of debt, it is likely that the company will either had to get acquired by a speculator, reorganize, or, liquidate. I have three brief case studies that will show you how Restaurant stocks fare in the market.

**First is Dave & Busters (PLAY)**, the Restaurant/Arcade amalgamation that is also noted for their Buffalo wings. The market capitalization for the company is $2.02 billion. In terms of stock price, the company has gone up in price. From $13.23 on August 21, 2020, the company now trades at $42.45. Is it worth it? Let us find out. 

The company’s equity is only $153 million ($169 million in 2020). With long-term debt, PLAY has $596 million in long-term debt. PLAY also has $1.3 billion in operating lease liabilities (which means that PLAY has a lot of rent to pay). In simpler terms, imagine having to pay $1.3 billion for an apartment without leasing it to anyone. The apartment would go out of business. And remember, the company has not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic! 

Current Assets are low for the company compared to their liabilities. PLAY has only $11.9 million in cash, with only $24 million in inventories. The company also lost $49 million in Free-Cash-Flow. Yes, 2019 had a positive of Cash Flow ($288 million), which is a good way to pay off debt. However, it will take a couple of years before the Restaurant business recovers; and cash cannot pay off the debt. The company has an Enterprise Value (Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash) of $3.92 billion. Finally, the company trades at over 13 times its’ book value. 

Would you invest into a company with little cash, lots of debt, loss of revenue? Probably not. 

**Second is Potbelly Corporation (PBPB)**. The company is a sandwich shop that is based in the mid-West as well as select cities in states such as Texas. Akin to PLAY, the company has gained a lot in Stock price; going up from $3.50 in November 2020 to its’ current price of $6.97. Is the company worth $193.81 million? Let us find out. 

PBPB, if invested in December 2015, would only be worth $40 in December 2020. By contrast, $100 in the NASDAQ in the same time would be worth over $260 – and that is in spite of the Pandemic. In 2018, the company lost $8.54 million. In 2019, the company lost $23.59 million despite only having $13 million less in revenue (this was due to income taxes). In 2020, the company lost $65.67 million in 2020 due to the Pandemic. 

PBPB only has $11.13 million in cash, and $3 million in inventories. Operating lease liabilities is $35.32 million, wiping out the Current Assets ($23.31 million). Total liabilities are $277.90 million compared to only $283.36 million in assets. PBPB only as $5.5 million in equity; yet, is valued at $193.81 million! Imagine buying $5.50’s worth of Lemonade for $194. Net cash provided by operating activities has gone down from $31 million in 2018 down to $18.17 million in $11.61 million in 2020. 

PBPB’s price is not worth the value. 

**Third and finally is Noodles & Company (NDLS)**

NDLS is exactly as it says in the tine: it sells Pasta meals. I have only been in there once in my life. The market values the company at $559 million. Akin to the other two food companies, NDLS has increased in Price over the past year (from $6.40 on November 2nd, 2020) to $12.34 on May 26, 2021. Is it worth the increase? Let us tune in, turn on, and drop out. 

Since 2016, NDLS has had a loss of net income four times (as high as $71.7 million in 2016) out of five.  With Cash Flows, NDLS has been variable, with last year generating only $9.12 million compared to $30.06 million in 2019. NDLS only has $7.8 million in cash and $9.6 million in inventories. Current Assets are $23.71 million. Current liabilities (including $26.1 million in current operating lease liabilities in 2020) are $58.13 million. In other words, immediate liquidity is impossible. Long-term debt is $41 million. 

NDLS may not be as bad as the other two stocks; but, it still is not worth the increase in stock price that happened this past year.

Prices should (in a perfect world) go up if the value is higher than the price. This is not a perfect world, however, and, the market does not reflect price in value sometimes. Restaurant investors beware.",nlku8p,"Restaurants, more Bloated than a Pregnant Woman:"

Here's the scenario I want:

\- StockA is at $100 and I place a buy order with a $10 trail  
\- StockA falls to $90, $80, $70, $60; order should not execute
\- StockA rises to $69; order should not execute
\- StockA rises to $70; order should execute

I used to do the financial planning for an airline so I do know more about this than 99.99% of people.

A couple of weeks ago I wrote:

“They’re not the same businesses they were before.

Even if it was legal to open up again today, their capacity is massively reduced. Many planes have been parked in the desert and unparking costs are very significant. Their capacity and thus ability to generate revenue and profit is much lower but their fixed costs bases are still huge. These businesses will not be profitable again for many years.

Even before Corona, heavy fixed costs and heavy competition meant this was an industry of razor thin margins.

What are my credentials? I spent years working for an airline finally managing their financial planning function.

Not financial advice.”

I would add that I think business travel demand won’t recover for a decade either which means even if they had the same capacity, one of their biggest revenue streams is squelched.",,
