But, I want to call out two additional risks to autonomous freight compared to taxis that we should keep in mind:

\-**Legislation burden** \- Long distance trucking, with the exception of large states (CA, TX, AK), requires vehicles to cross state lines. That means, before autonomous OTR freight catches on, it will require synchronized legislation with multiple states and the fed. Taxis in one city have a lower legislation burden because likely only requires state/city approval.

\-**Depots** \- There is already a technology that allow a single individual to haul massive amounts of freight, meaning the human labor/ton of freight ratio is great. That technology is.... trains! What are the downsides of freight trains? Limited delivery points and delays in freight yards. Hence the power of trucking. However, autonomous trucking will start, as you mention, with highway traveling. That means these trucks will have to arrive at a depot, unload, and wait for a local driver. Now, I still believe that this is much more efficient use of capital, assets, and labor, but keep in mind that autonomous trucks and required depots begin to take on the look and logistical nightmare that are freight trains.

All that said, I still think that autonomous OTR is the future.",,

They have a half a billion in cash to burn through
They have a new board coming in
They have a dedicated customer base
They have the chance to aquire a new market segment
They have a market of something like $70b annually to go after
They have not however hit their target revenue


Then there is a certain upstart electric truck company that:
Is hemorrhaging money
Has not hit any targeted benchmarks
Has not hired enough employees to build vehicles at a rate they want to

1. While sober, roam the internet and make a list of things you would love to purchase but *could* potentially get you in trouble with the wife. Look for items that you *could* undoubtedly justify to your friends that you have known the longest after a 15 minute debate. Pro-Tip: it helps if your friends live within a 25 minute radius in case shit hits the fan.
2. When you have narrowed it down to 5, leave the websites up on your browser but minimize it to the bottom of your screen and go about your day as well as early evening as you normally would. 
3. Now....its game-time. When you arrive at the portion of the evening that you are on that drink that you know is taking you to the land of the lost......open that browser and purchase your favorite item you saved from earlier in the day. Keep the purchase confirmation up on the browser and minimize it to the bottom of your desktop.
4. Pour Yourself that next drink and enjoy the rest of the evening.
5. The next morning open up your laptop and enjoy!

Currently on my list....... a $3500 tipi made in Montana that fits 6 people",,

Based on recent tweets from Joke Cramer and comments from Bitch Greenfield (sorry guys, did I get your names correct?) I'm led to believe that hedge funds may try to go back to the SEC, Congress or who ever they can and then re-argue that reddit subs are acting as a group and should be forced to follow certain regulations blah blah blah, that won't be possible but hedge funds may make that argument in the hopes of being let off the hook in some way. 

Do not give hedge funds any way to wiggle out of this! Do not speak for others or use group speak terms, please!

Do not give hedge funds any way to wiggle out of this! Do not speak for others or use group speak terms, please!

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.

If remember AMC shorters felt like they are fucked they'd buy to cover as there is plenty of volume to do that. If short interest is INCREASING it tells you what their thought process is. 

The bottom line retail buyers are driving up AMC price hoping that someone will throw them a lifeline and buy it from them at that higher price but it's not going to happen. Even if 100% of the short interest was covered, which is 20% of the stock right now, 80% of people holding the stock would be fucked as there would be no buyers left for them.",,

348,,2021-05-28 04:45:41,t3_nmq05j,,wallstreetbets,"So this is something I can't figure out and I'd really appreciate it if someone helped me understand.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

If you take a coin that only has a total supply of 40 000 coins like YFII at 1600$/coin currently. Bought it, held it and promoted it. If demand increases significantly, there's literally not enough coins to go around. The price would skyrocket to unimaginable levels. And people could sell fractions of the coin at an extremely high premiums. YFII literally has a TOTAL SUPPLY of only 40000, Not 4million or trillion. 40k, that's it.

TLDR: SILVER and GOLD MOON by end of june and spy might drill.

&#x200B;

A lot of basel 3 regulations are happening on june 28 2021 and an important one is the Net Stable Funding Rate. 

This regulation in essence requires banks to prove their physical holdings of commodities relative to the amount of physical commodities they have lent out or shorted or leveraged on.

[https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf)

more details on that link\^

&#x200B;

Many commodities traders say this is the single biggest event in their career and this regulation could send SILVER and GOLD to the moon when:

1. Banks reveal they don't have enough physical holdings -> indicates shortage 
2. Banks can't short physical commodities like gold and silver beyond their physical holdings -> banks cover their shorts causing a squeeze. Banks manipulating the silver market is not a conspiracy theory spread during the gme squeeze to distract wsb retards from gme. The manipulation has been going on for a long time and big banks have been fined heavily for manipulating the silver market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325))

JP Morgan has been a big culprit of manipulating the precious metals market by suppressing the price through paper shorts and when the price falls they buy physical bars of silver.

&#x200B;

Recall that the basel three regulations take place on june 28. Take a look at the OI for $SPY

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[OI for $SPY](https://preview.redd.it/yxbdwumzr3271.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef7a95c937dfdcf0cc136a95c09205a46ddb6c64)

Look at the 06/30 oi. There's an unusually high oi for 06/30 which is a weekly expiry whereas all the other weeklys are nowhere close to the oi on 06/30. There's a 74% oi for put and 25% oi for call on that expiry and similar ratios for the expiries close to june 28 when the basel 3 regulations take effect.

&#x200B;

Now look at the oi for $SLV

&#x200B;

[OI for $SLV](https://preview.redd.it/on521lejs3271.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb65ae75d160e8df27682d7a24ddeb82a946d36)

Again look at the 06/30 expiry with the unusally high oi. 1.1 million oi on 06/30 which is INSANELY HIGH for any expiry let alone a weekly. And at this expiry the call oi is 80% and the put oi is 19% which is the opposite of what was observed with SPY. 

Now, normal wsb retards have no idea of basel 3 and the effects on the precious metals market. The high oi and call oi on june 30 on $SLV can't be attributed to wsb retards who hate silver. It's most likely the smart money coming into play. 

Spy has a high put/call ratio while silver has a high call/put ratio on that expiry. Similar values on QQQ and GLD respectively. This points to a scenario where silver moons and spy drills.

Take note that june 28 has a lot of other regulations coming into place as well and there can be other huge moves in the market in other sectors due to the different regulations.

A lot of wsb thought the silver squeeze movement was a conspiracy by the banks but look up the data by yourself if you aren't convinced by this dd.",nnts46,BASEL 3 is going to send SILVER and GOLD to the MOON

I like to cook, but I enjoy grocery shopping, picking out my meat, etc. I also don’t follow recipes 1 for 1.

I also have not been impressed with the recipes for the price point. It’s just not for me. Like, I could make a better dish for less with superior ingredients.

I did try it once and everything that wasn’t 5-10 bucks extra was chicken or pork based (cheap). Honestly, I WOULD use something like this if they provided international recipes. For example, I’d love to cook some Ramen or Thai Noodles, but I’d have to buy a whole new spice rack for something I’d rarely use. I also don’t have sensibilities for those flavor nodes, so I’d need a recipe.

I would have thought hellofresh would fail given how they give away all those promos (I paid next to nothing for my trial) but they’re actually doing really well and have been since pre-Covid. Beats me, but I can’t pretend I’m a proxy for the average consumer when the numbers don’t lie.",,

But no one is going to buy a coin for significantly higher than its actual value when its blantantly obvious that people are manipulating the price.

For this to actually work, someone would need to think the coin is overvalued to begin with and sell a whole bunch of these coins at a later date. Like lets say a month from now. They sell 20k of these coins for a price lower than current markets value with a delivery date of 1 month. They expect that now they flood the market it will drive the price down and they can buy the coins cheaper and fill the orders at a later date. For a massive profit. But when it comes time for that people have caught on and bought all the available coins, as well as the 20k that were esentially short sold naked coins. The seller now has to fulfill his promised delivery by buying every available coin he can or start paying failure to deliver fees. Thus driving the coin to ridiculous prices.",,

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed. 

Thanks for understanding, and may your tendies be golden, and portfolio be green.
