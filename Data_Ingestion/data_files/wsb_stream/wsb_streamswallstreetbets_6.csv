They did the same with ToysRUs and even Bed Bath and Beyond, trying to ruin these companies for profits. Our Hero, a guy named DFV (deepfuckingValue), aka RoaringKitty, was running a successful youtube channel where he said 'hey, they are shorting way too much on AMC and GME and we should buy'. So a bunch of Redditors on WSB decided to join together and like the stock and they did, causing it to go from $4 to $400 before Vlad Tenev, criminal pawn and CEO of Robinhood, was ordered to halt buying to stop the squeeze by the oligarchs who run the world. Naturally, he got away scott free and retail investors got fucked. But since then, the HF's who  own both AMC, GME and SPCE and a few others, always pull the same shit at the same time. Whatever their computer algorithim is, in general there is _always_ a short attack Tuesday and/or Wednesday between 10:30 and 1:30, and again Friday between 10:30 and 1:30 on BOTH AMC and GME. This past week was a bit different because they can't short or are out of shorts so they turned to buying ITM PUTS and taking a loss, used them to drive the price down because the squeeze would bankrupt them with ITM Calls.",,

221,,2021-05-29 18:02:36,t3_nnsvfa,,wallstreetbets,"I  have a stock portfolio on eTrade.  Every two weeks I take a bit of my  pay check and buy a few shares of one or two stocks and sometimes I sell  out of part of another stock position to take some profit.  I want to  compare the annualized performance of my portfolio with the S&P 500  and other indices.  eTrade gives me a lot of data like portfolio gain %  and an actual dollar $ gain on each investment and overall in my whole  portfolio.  Which is great.

The  problem is that the overall % gain of my portfolio calculated by eTrade  does not account for the time frame.  So it's not annualized.  A 10%  gain over 2 weeks counts the same as a 10% gain over 2 years.  On top of  that because I am adding a bit of $ every couple weeks (and sometimes  selling shares too) I cannot easily calculate the annualized performance  myself without a LOT of work.

So  for example: so if I buy 25 shares of stock A on Feb 1, buy 2 shares of  stock B and buy 8 shares of stock C on Feb 15, and buy 12 shares of  stock D and SELL 5 shares of stock A on March 2 then how do I calculate  the average weighted annualized return of my portfolio a year or two  later?

Is there a way to view this  information automatically calculated on eTrade?  Or does a different  trading platform provide this kind of calculation automatically?  Or do I  just need have to manually calculate this myself on Excel?

Thank you",nnsvfa,I have a portfolio of ~40 stocks. Every 2 weeks I buy more shares in 1 or 2 stocks and sometimes also sell some of the shares I have in a stock or 2. How can I view in eTrade annualized weighted performance of my portfolio??

So hate to break it to you guys but shorts didn‚Äôt cover and it appears this was just retail unloading shares at higher prices into other retail investors.  So unless amc actually does something like a steaming service or gets bought out by another company that actually knows what their doing. I don‚Äôt see any situation where shorts will cover.

On Fridays, the HF's will _always_ find a way to drop the price before expiry to fuck you. They know there is a max pain point where the PUTS get fucked and the CALLS get fucked. They can short the upward momentum to park the price right at the pain point. They know how, and do it every Friday. They either buy or sell short to get it to land in the exact to the penny spot to hurt. So, you have to sell your position Thursday EOD otherwise you will get fucked on Friday. Chances are you opened your new position on a Monday, because it almost always rises Mondays because of the T+2 and they usually can't/don't short Mondays. So if you buy Monday/Tuesday, you are buying high setting you up for a loss. Best time to buy is usually Wednesday, Thursday and sometimes Friday Dips. The dips generally happen right after open. It often spikes up, and then spikes down. Sometimes spikes down, then up. There is always price volatility between 9:30 and 10 and it settles down after 10. If you have giant balls, you can wait til Friday for the short attack and buy the super dip, but that's dangerous. You should get in the habit of buying mid week and selling mid week because Friday is just too volatile and shorts go out of the way to fuck you. I find buying EOD Friday if the shorts crushed the stock is a good time to buy as Monday it generally moons and I can close my positions Tuesday for some quick profit, or if they are strong, wait til Thursday EOD as Friday it's likely to sink.

Amazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.

&#x200B;

Here's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store)

&#x200B;

**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**

Due to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier

&#x200B;

Here's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): 

Chief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke 

Chief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens

Chief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis

&#x200B;

**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**

Many people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails

How does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number

&#x200B;

**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**

Between developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.

&#x200B;

**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**

Being able to shift the news narrative from ""Amazon kills unionization attempts"" to ""Amazon saves \~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop"" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal

&#x200B;

Just a couple recent articles about Amazon:

Frontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/19/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/19/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat)

&#x200B;

**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**

Now that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.

Elon & Jeff have been rivals for years:

Buying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P/E ratio). As of 5/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5/28

Having a P/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.",nnprt0,Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models. Here's my full case.

**TL;DR  BEAR CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THIS MAY KEEP  INVESTORS AWAY REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING IT HAS GOING FOR IT DUE TO  CURRENT MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND GENERAL OIL FUD, POTENTIALLY  OPEC/RUSSIA/WHATEVER HANDLES THE UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY OF LIFTED IRANIAN  SANCTIONS POORLY AND CRASHES OIL PRICES**

**TL;DR  BULL CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THUS INVESTOR FEAR  HAS LEFT THE STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED WITH MODERATE IMMEDIATE  UPSIDE (1-2 weeks, $26 > $31) AND 2-3x POTENTIAL BY END OF YEAR,  BEING ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO PROFIT OFF THE PRESENT AND  NAVIGATE THE FUTURE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY**

We  live in oily times. This has been the case since the dawn of the  petroleum industry; it is the lifeblood of the world, almost quite  literally, and our first fears of oil were that we would drain the  planet dry. Now, consensus is shifting towards the real issue with  reliance upon fossil fuels - if we keep up as we have been, we will end  all life on the planet in quite a different way. Climate change is real,  and the mainstream narrative has finally caught up - with covid slowly  fading away, and an era of relative peace (apart from the middle east  exploding as usual and china slowly buying the world), it is going to  become the hottest topic on our plates and people are going to be  feeling very angry about the prime culprits, big oil. This has already  started, last week, with the first strikes hitting Shell and Exxon, and I  have absolutely no doubt that similar incidents will continue to sweep  across the industry, especially once we hit full reopening and the media  needs its next big fix of drama. For those invested or who are  considering investing in the oil industry, we live in uncertain times,  but again, we live in oily times. I truly believe that the energy/oil  sector will fully recover from COVID and begin to absolutely take off  over the next few years, but not without a significant degree of  turbulence regarding oil companies. This will not be based around  fundamentals, but fear. For this reason, I feel that Occidental  Petroleum is the best positioned company to weather the potential media  circus, profit off the rising prices of oil and make absolute bank as  they begin to shift into carbon capture, which is what I believe to be  the future of oil companies in an attempt to remain carbon neutral  without massive restructuring and countless stranded assets. Much of  what I'm saying will apply to many small-midcap petroleum companies, but  I like OXY the most - and I love the technical setup, which I can't say  for other strong candidates like Devon Energy (DVN)

**SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Oil  players cutting production without a meaningful reduction in demand is  massively bullish for oil. The lower the supply, the higher the demand,  and thus the higher the price of any given commodity. If the oil  industry is forced to restrict oil extraction, the first companies on  the block for being strong armed into lowering production are going to  be the supermajors. OXY is not a supermajor, and has already lowered  production/plans to keep production lowered this year (and leaned out  significantly, as they are now profitable at around $30bbl if I read  correctly). Therefore, reduced production from the supermajors in a  sector that is already likely to hit a supply crunch sometime this year  is bullish for all small-midcap oil producers, and although they have  seen good quarterly results, many of them are yet to recover to  pre-covid levels.

**TECHNICALS**

I'm  still too poor to afford crayons, but the long and short of it is this:  On March 5th 2021, oil closed at $66.27bbl. OXY was valued at $31.23  per share. On May 28th 2021, oil closed at $66.66bbl. Aside from this  being very bullish for Satan - the price of OXY at close was $25.96.  This, to me, makes no sense at all, given that OXY could be considered  as a highly levered company regarding oil prices. The price of oil did  not spike as rapidly as it did in March, but right now it feels to be in  a very clear uptrend, and has demonstrated a level of stability that  March did not. Moreso, OXY posted strong earnings and an EPS beat, but  they have been unable to recover recent highs, and pre-covid highs still  seem to be a distant dream, though entirely realistic within my eyes.  To me, this lack of positive price action is purely because of FUD -  people aren't sure what to make of oil right now, because they're smooth  brained retards. The bottom line is the bottom line; OXY and friends  are making big bucks, and the more restrictions the industry as a whole  finds itself slapped with, the higher the cost of oil, which leads to  greater benefit for small-medium players. Or, potentially, bankruptcy,  but I think OXY's investment in carbon capture is their silver bullet  which will give them safe haven and even greater appeal in the face of  future uncertainty.

**CARBON CAPTURE**

OXY  has significant interest in carbon capture. This is sort of beyond the  scope of this DD, but essentially, carbon capture is used to sequester  carbon - and in this case, this captured carbon is used to pump more oil  out of the ground. I personally believe it's going to be an incredibly  helpful and possibly even necessary technology, and I think if  restrictions do pass in regards to oil drilling, it's going to come also  in the form of regulations mandating an amount of carbon capture per  output. I'm aware that there's quite a lot of debate regarding the  actual usefulness of carbon capture, but it has clear and undeniable  benefit in oil drilling and regardless: governments throw money at  nonsense all the time, and even if it is ultimately an ineffective  method I believe that carbon capture is likely to see significant  interest and investment. It is entirely possible that OXY becomes an  industry leader in this respect, and it would mark a ridiculously  lucrative pivot when combined with their current position in oil. This  could easily see them reaching the ranks of the supermajors, if these  companies are unable to keep up with the current state of change and can  find no appropriate pivot themselves.

THE SHORT TERM PLAY

**The  price of oil has been inching towards testing 5 year highs over the  past week, having pushed past 52w highs on the Friday but closing lower  on the day. I believe this is for a single reason, one which will have  resolved by the 1st of June. We're currently in a long weekend with an  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and the Iranian oil sanction FUD is still  weighing heavily on the market. Thus, it would have been foolish to buy  into a stock position over the last few days when next week will give  much greater clarity - hence why a number of oil equities have remained  somewhat flat compared to similar price action in March - since it is  not entirely clear in which direction oil prices will go right now and a  lot can change over a long weekend into an OPEC meeting.**

**Personally,  I believe that oil prices will go right the fuck up. OPEC is unlikely  to deviate from their plan, and will very likely talk on how they would  handle the potential reintroduction of Iranian oil to the market. This,  coming off of the memorial day weekend being a psychological marker that  things are ""back to normal"", with the weeks following being  historically bullish for the market in general, the current concerns on  inflation, the stories on oil majors cutting back production and the  ongoing tensions in the middle east makes me think we see oil cross  $68bbl by next week and, without a significant pullback, $70bbl by mid  June.**

**Therefore,  the play is simple. Check oil price movement immediately following the  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and if it's stable or moving up, buy July 9th  OXY calls at a $28 strike - my price target being $33. So long as oil  doesn't crash back below $65, I have no doubt that OXY will retrace to  at least $30 by July 9th, which is a comfortable 100% profit at current  prices - I also expect an IV bump following OPEC, as there should be  some large buys as funds rush to reposition themselves in oil stocks  once the FUD clears. A few of the stocks in this sector - OXY and RIG in  particular - are quite prone to posting 10% to 15% green days out of  nowhere, and OXY is well overdue for one. Overall, these stocks have  been lagging in confidence compared to March, even with more stable  price action and higher highs - I expect a correction to the upside very  soon.**

THE LONG TERM PLAY

In the unlikely even that oil tanks after the OPEC meeting, we move to long term - buy OXY calls or shares at *whatever price they've dipped to the next time oil is around $58-$60bb*l,  because that feels like a historically strong level of support and  should hold even stronger given the current monetary environment. As  long as oil is above $55bbl, OXY is sitting in a pretty profitable  space, so a significant drop in price if oil drops to around the $60bbl  mark would indicate the stock being oversold compared to fundamentals,  and it's likely to pop back up around the Q2/Q3 earnings.

Buy  and hold for 5-10 years and I see a relatively safe 3-5x. Boomer shit,  and I bet they'll even up their dividend by then, but I think 2023 calls  are a bit unpredictable - 2022 are likely to print, I like $40s, but  things might get choppy past then. Still, even with their level of debt,  I don't see OXY as among the companies that may go under during the  coming massive shifts in the oil industry, and I believe that they will  be debt free within a few years and successfully pivot to carbon capture  and make a new name for themselves there. Potentially literally, given  that Total is now TotalEnergies, and Petroleum is going to go the way of  the gamer word.

**BEAR CASE**

There's  really not much here to be bearish about; it depends on the price  movement of oil and investor sentiment about large debtors. Personally I  believe that OXY will have a significantly cleaner balance sheet by end  of year, and given some stability in the price of oil above $60bbl I  think most investors will come around to that fact, too, but given the  general uncertainty in the market - strangely absent this week, as it  was overall bullish - OXY is not the safest investment, and the smart  money required to move the needle on an established and ""problem"" large  cap significantly might be absent for a few years yet, until some  definite stability and repayment of debt is found.

Also,  OXY did some potentially really stupid shit hedging oil prices and  their profits are capped at oil being $75bbl. Personally, I think this  is fine, as I see oil capping out at around $75bbl for the year, but  expect OXY stock price to hit a ceiling around there if crude does  breach $75 this year. At which point, I would advise either DVN or RIG  as they have much more room to run in a significant oil bull market.

Thanks for reading, if you have.

Good  luck to all; this is one of the ideas I have been more confident on  this year, and since I have made a fair bit of money off of various DDs  shared here (and I fucking hate what this place has become by the way,  but shout out to steel gang), I have wanted to give back in some way.",nnog16,"The state (and future) of oil, an OXY - Occidental Petroleum - trade idea."

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May‚Äôs employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June‚Äôs performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday‚Äôs jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday‚Äôs employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> ‚ÄúYou know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,‚Äù said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. ‚ÄúHopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we‚Äôre, ‚ÄòHey, the economy is still on track.‚Äô‚Äù
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed‚Äôs main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday‚Äôs jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed‚Äôs beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> ‚ÄúWith the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,‚Äù said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe net net on the index level is basically it‚Äôs a stock market that‚Äôs moving sideways,‚Äù Emanuel said. ‚ÄúOur view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed‚Äôs paying insufficient attention to price stability.‚Äù
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. ‚ÄúThe average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500‚Ä≤s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs way too much liquidity in the system, and it‚Äôs happening as a result of the Fed‚Äôs ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
> Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,‚Äù he said.
*****
> ‚ÄúInstitutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don‚Äôt have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There‚Äôs not enough fixed income assets to go around,‚Äù said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
> What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market‚Äôs performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to ‚Äì1.1% while S&P 500‚Ä≤s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists‚Äô forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result ‚Äúeconomic surprises,‚Äù both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> ‚ÄúAlthough high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies‚Äô innovation and profitability advantages.‚Äù explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bear.png))**

> This week's moves left the bull-bear spread little changed at 10. That's down 0.7 points from last week but still above the 9.5 reading from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Once again, the highest percentage of investors are in the neutral camp at 37.1%. As was the case last week, that makes for the highest level in neutral sentiment since the first week of 2020 when it stood north of 40%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

I'd say look into something that you like and go from there.
 You like technology, then start researching company's in that sector you think might be valuable.
You like eating food, check into that market.
You like cars, there's things out there to make money on.

The reason i give this advice is that if you pick something your passionate about, your more likely to put in real effort into learning why you should or shouldn't invest in it, and you can then apply that reasoning to stocks you might be less into.

Eg: you like tv, so you look into Viacom and Netflix, one has a high valuation, the other low, there will be strengths and weakness for both companies, there will be speculation that one is going to do X and the other is going to do Y. You then break down what you think is the best reason to buy into either of the two and then start driving into some subs to see other sentiment and if it helps to either convince you to jump, or to stay on the dock.",,

The theory is that the initial vote was postponed because too many votes came in for the number of shares that have been issued. Since not everyone votes he is getting the data on votes being sent out to get an accurate picture of how many shares there are actually moving on the market rather than an estimate based on votes that come in. This can also potentially help track down where these additional shares are coming from.

This may not be the case, its just speculation. The only information we have to go off of is that as of last count there were 3.2 million investors in amc in the us & canada alone as of last count, another 850,000 in south korea. Being ultra conservative, even if the German exchange and everywhere else in the world only adds another 1 million investors that is 5 million, meaning the average shareholder would only have 100 shares. It's possible, but not probable, polling suggests the average is closer to 250 shares.",,
