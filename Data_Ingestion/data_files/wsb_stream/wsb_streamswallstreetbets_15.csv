Classes about stock markets and similar topics, I’m really disappointed about the professors, they all seem either theorical and no experience, heavily based on TA and one dude who seems to be very mathematical and quantitative.


I asked all of them their views of the market and all of them dodged the question, the one in charge of everything seems to be very proud of his “market report” which is nothing but a letter showing daily/weekly results from indexes and commodities.


I asked if anyone had any particular company or industry worth checking out for the future and all of them dodged the question.


I kinda was expecting them to be more focused on valuations or stuff like that…",,

For the LEAPS (have Jan 22 and Jan 23) I have 60% in SIL and 40% in SILJ. I was angling to max my returns at a 2x move in the silver spot price at a 75% probability weighting with the remaining shooting for the moon at a 5x move. Even if there's a 2x move most of my options should be ITM.

Have a ton of different strikes, for SILJ across 17c, 18c, 19c, 20c, 22c, 24c, 30c, and 35c. (inventory was thin when I was buying in late April). For SIL I have 46c, 60c, and 70c. I'm also very new to options so I have no idea what I'm doing.

The market was pretty illiquid, there weren't many trades for a while so my broker was marking my position at what I guess was the Black-Scholes valuation, which was higher than the lowest ask. There's a lot more supply and demand now.

You go into a neighborhood with the thought that the value of the homes are going to go up.   


You go to homeowner, and say ""I'd like \*the ability\* to buy this house."" I pay a small premium that I will buy that house by the expiration date (say 30 days for instance) for $100k. If I don't buy the house then I lose my premium, and the contract expires.   


Now while I hold this contract.. The value of the house goes up +$200k. It's now worth $300k while i held this contract for $100k. Someone tries to buy the house, but since I hold the contract, they have to purchase the contract from me if they want the house. I sell the contract for $200k and take the profit  and then they can buy the house for $100k (if you could transfer the contract to another person) Don't even know if you can do that or not but I mean.. pretending here.

466,,2021-05-30 00:12:50,t3_nnzj7e,,wallstreetbets,"So a few days ago someone made a sentiment analyzing bot for this sub and as a programmer myself, I thought I’d try my hand! For those of you that want to poke around or use this for yourself, here’s my [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader).

&#x200B;

**HOW I DID THIS:** Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 6 other stocks -- I could do more but the relevance drops off typically after this. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive for a beginner/intermediate programmer, but essentially what it uses is VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.

**HOW THIS WORKS:** The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.

In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The acting was good , but the movie could have been better” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.

**Results and some stats:** Right now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)

\- The strategy is backtested only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- Max drawdown of -8.7% (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)

Happy to answer any more questions about the process/results. I think doing stuff like this is pretty cool as someone with a foot in algo trading and traditional financial markets",nnzj7e,Made another WSB sentiment analyzing bot (I used machine learning) -- 33% annual return ($16k).

Bigger age gap than you have but when you know someone’s the one for you nothing else matters. In my case, we dated for a while but we started having our differences and I felt we weren’t totally compatible so I broke it off. It seems like for you though there’s nothing about incompatibility, you’re just telling yourself that age is the issue.

Reddit has become deluded into thinking we have some major power over the investment firms and as though we can easily squeeze them. The squeeze already happened, that's why it rocketed to this price. I would highly recommend people not to hold/buy based on Reddit hype. You see this same shit time and time again from people desperate to keep people holding so they can hopefully make it go a bit higher and then jump out. **If it's making it into mainstream news and Reddit front page, it's generally too late to invest big.** Because that's a sign the average person knows and will have invested and there isn't much more room to rally.

If it will significantly financially impact you for the price to drop back down a fair bit, then please do not hold onto such a volatile stock. At the very least you better be ready to sell at a moments notice or have stop-loss/take-profit orders setup. And certainly do not buy in big at this point in time, it's too late for a big move like that.

When I make a trade/buy, I note the price of s&p at the same time. I track in spreadsheet (google sheet using googlefinance functions). If the trade is making money and it’s return % is above the s&p return %, I’m winning the trade. If I’m making $ but I’m lagging the s&p, the trade is behind, if I’m losing $ on the trade…we’ll it’s just a loser.

It's a game for big players who will short it first, and when it will fall. Yea they can wait to see if it goes up, but they can wait too long and loose milions.   


Imagine you have 5 players, each has 100 000 stocks in AMC, till it goes up everyone is happy, and they want for it to go up as long as they can.  
But first one who will sell stock will get most money, cuz after that there could be panic in the market and price will drop, so other 4 with their 100 000 stocks will lose hundreds of thousends of profit by waiting too long and not selling first.  


See? It's a big game, and yea, they can tell each other not to sell. But can they trust eachother when there are literally milions of dollars and other players are their competition?

I have a finance degree from a top uni, so I know a thing or two about trading stocks what goes through these hedge fund managers' minds as well. 

Regardless, this is not financial advice, just the opinion of a (somewhat educated) retard. 

Here is my take on everything that's going on:

**Short Interest Levels:** Some shorts have started to cover their losses, but not nearly enough to cause a real short squeeze yet. Short interest in AMC has not decreased, showing the shorts have not yet learned their lesson, and we are going to teach them what's up. [Short interest is currently above 20%.](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc)

**This is like GameStop at $40:** a lot of people sold out at $40 when they were up 3-4X on their GME investment, but those who had real diamond hands raped the gains that came later on in the run. We are just getting started and as long as we don't give up, we are likely to see the same type of squeeze. GameStop went up 2500%, while AMC has only gone up about 120% so far during this latest run. 

**AMC will kill earnings:** as the world reopens we are seeing increased demand for activities like going to the movies, which will significantly increase the value of firms like AMC that were able to take advantage of the whole meme stock bull run to transform some of their debt into equity, giving them the ability to run a healthier balance sheet and thus allowing them to pivot if need be. 

Alright guys I hope you like my basic DD

As usual, I'm a retard and don't listen to anything I'm saying. 

I hope our wives' boyfriends can buy us dinner if we fail, but until then, 💎 🖐 !!!
