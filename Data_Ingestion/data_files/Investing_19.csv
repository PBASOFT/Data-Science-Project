65,,2021-05-27 14:29:27,t3_nm8pt3,,investing,"Hi all,

Have been pondering this some time since rates were dropped down to zero last year. With rates close to zero and future increases being negative for bond prices, why wouldn't it make sense to take some money out of bonds and place it into financially healthy blue chips with reasonable (but not too high) dividends? 

By ""financially healthy"" I would typically include dividend yield between 2%-4%, payout ratio below 50% or 60%, debt to equity below 1 or preferably below 0.75,  free cash flow margin above 10%, and a solid cash balance (can't get very specific since it varies heavily by industry). These attributes typically apply to large/megacap stocks so that wouldn't be a requirement but it'd usually fit the bill. 

My thinking is that rates being at 0% negatively affect bonds in two ways: lower yield (10 year treasury is about 1.6% right now) and less upside as prices will get dinged when rates inevitably rise.

Suppose company x issues100 more shares and sells them on the market to raise money for operations.

There are now 200 total shares outstanding.   If the price stays the same @ $20 the market cap would double to $4,000.  Why would a company's value double just from doubling its share?  It generally won't.  All those earnings and financials just got diluted meaning, if the company was earning $1 in profit per share, it is now 50 cents per share.

I'm not going to pay the same price per share after adding shares because one share now is a less % of total ownership than it was when only 100 shares total were outstanding.

Is it maybe the most ideal thing to do in terms of optimizing returns? Probably not, but at least it lets you invest in equities so you can have market exposure.

The losses from volatility drag scale with volatility squared. A 3x fund will multiply its arithmetic average returns by 3x but the difference between compound and arithmetic average will be multiplied by 9x. There is a tipping point where leveraging more does not increase the long term gains and starts to decrease them instead. That point basically depends on the sharpe ratio of the asset. (And indeed for some assets, the tipping point could be lower than 1x)  

Secondly, the natural way of looking at a lack of change in an unleveraged ETF with a static portfolio is if the price is unchanged, that is, a compound return of 0%, rather than an arithmetic average return of zero. If you treat that as the natural frame of reference, then an unleveraged ETF does not depend on the path its underlying portfolio takes, only the value of its portfolio at the beginning and end.

You expected Disney to perform with re-opening, but people have already been buying for a while in anticipation of the eventual re-open.  Additionally, Disney earnings not that long ago didn't get a great reaction and Paypal has been sold off recently with other growth stocks.

What I’m saying is, is that your underlying is going to collapse eventually, and you’ll be stuck holding the back on an equity without positive carry. 

The market has gone from having a Risk free yield (TBond) to now having yield-free risk. If I’m taking the risk of volatile equity valuations, I want positive carry to help compensate the risk premium, so I have two drivers of value, positive carry via a dividend and potential equity appreciation, instead of just appreciation. You literally are doubling your revenue streams. 

The reason dividends create value is because there is a whole world of investors seeking yield/income (almost all retirees), so stocks that consistently pay dividends get bid up to a premium. Companies return excess cash to investors as dividends in order to make their equity more attractive in the market place. It’s more about what life cycle and industry the company is in vs what is the right way to handle excess cash on a balance sheet. Seeing a reit pile up excess cash is stupid, and they could lose their reit status if they aren’t distributing 90% of their profits. Seeing a young tech company pile up cash is a huge plus. Two very different objectives for two very different type of investors. I invest for income, and dividend investing is one of the best ways to get consistent income. 

It also out performs. The “dividend kings” have outperformed for quite a while Now, over long stretches of time (which ends up being everyone’s time frame)

It’s also a better lifestyle. I spend 10hrs a year on my portfolio, and I get double digit returns on average, over the 5yrs. You might get better returns, but you’re also managing trades and checking markets. Are those extra few percentage really worth the extra hundreds of hours per year?? For me, no. Especially since those returns are more volatile than just holding dividend stocks.",,

This is a non-issue over the medium- to long-term, and pretending you know better than the market is asking for pain. There's a great Benjamin Graham quote that says, ""In the short-run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it's a weighing machine"".

While you may be able to pick out a bubble in a segment of equities in the short-run, the market will set the closest thing we have to a ""real"" value over the medium- to long-term. Why do you think 90%+ of professional fund managers trail the market over 10+ year periods?

Yes, automate your investing into the index mutual fund.  Buy fractional shares every month or every pay period or whatever.

And then, every three or six or twelve months, as it suits you, sell as much of the MF as you need to purchase whole shares of the ETF, if you -really- want to be in the ETF.  You can enter this transaction ""backwards"" so you don't sell too much: put in your order to BUY the ETF first, see what price it fills at, THEN sell that much of the MF.  The MF sale settles in T+1, so the cash will be available before it is needed for the ETF purchase, which settles on T+2.

But, you may find that that's too much work to save a few bps.  Nothing wrong with keeping the MF as your primary investment, being able to buy and sell in exact dollar amounts and settling next day.",,

If you look into the philosophies of the collectivist political ideas you’ll find that they work off an assumption that most people are intrinsically good therefore it’s them (the bad people) keeping us (the good people) from accomplishing our goals. 

The belief that all people are intrinsically good is a really bad idea to organize around. Put another way - until we can design a socialist utopia with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell at the head of the planning committee that won’t rip apart or turn into a dictatorship then socialism will only work in theory.",,

304,gznews1,2021-05-27 16:00:22,t1_gznews1,t1_gzn2ut2,investing,"Thanks for the input! I think saying bonds used for income is a bit skewed by junk bonds though. Buying a 30 year treasury for income is the same as buying it for negative correlation to equities, and considering junk bonds are closer to equities in risk/reward it makes sense that they'd sell off during economic crises. But the big problem, as I detailed in another comment, is that the fundamental attractiveness of bonds during an economic crisis is considerably lower in my mind with rates at zero because the Fed can't lower rates and increase the value of existing bonds. I can't think of a U.S. crisis occurring when rates were already at zero so it's kind of hard to figure out whatd happen. 

Anyways sorry for the ramble and once again appreciate the response!",,

That's why I learned this time around. SADLY it was after this downturn. OP's point is the general consensus for the younger investor who has little need to invest in bonds (index ETFs in all reality are the new bonds where higher risk investments like nfts, crypto, and failing gaming retailer call options are the new young man's investments). 

I will say that generally accepted idea is that now is a bad time to get into bonds since risks are low, we're in an early (or mid) bull market, inflation is rising, interest rates and yields are near 0, and we're flooded with stimulus from every central bank in the world. However, your point about bond's value stands. I think it would be wise to shift a portion of assets into bonds when times start to boom, interest rates go up, unnoticeable & potential risk increase, and the bull market cycle starts showing late stage characteristics. I'm not sure how long that will be, but I don't think that will be years off.",,

* Valuation Change (P/E or P/B re-pricing)
* Earnings Growth (increase in EPS)
* Dividend yield
* Foreign Exchange.

For the past decade, 5.4% of the US over-performance over international equity was attributed to valuation change. They expect that in the next decade the valuations of US equities will contract (P/E multiples to go down).

Talking about thing like returns in percentages would seem to indicate so and looking at indices in logarithmic scales you see a (mostly) linear progression (that is to say that with a linear scale you would see something close to exponential growth.   


I know that money supply and inflation are also measured using percentages for YoY growth which adds to the case that the financial system is built with these non-linear relationships.   


Since it looks like numbers are getting bigger and bigger faster and faster (while their actual value may not be changing more as a percentage) it seems like human emotion will kind of get harder and harder to deal with. It would appear that there is extra volatility in the market as a whole but in reality the percent change may not be different than it has been historically.   


Is this a sustainable model in the long run? Like if we are talking exponential growth, the difference between 6% average market growth and 2% inflation is gonna be massive eventually.

Curious on what others think about this approach -- I think this firstly sounds like a great way to blow away your retirement savings if you make bad choices.

My retirement accounts are like 100% passive funds and ETFs, while my personal brokerage is like 70% of those and 30% of individual stocks and things I wanted to invest in with ""play money"". 

Looking at the stocks I've done well on (AMZN, NVDA, ATVI) -- I do see the desire to do this in a Roth IRA account -- at least with a small amount of money. Saving on those capitol gains would equate to tens of thousands at times.

But today - there aren't going to be many retail traders or institutions that would risk unhedged short positions with a volatile stock like GME.

A lot of the theories around a short squeeze is based on short interest and short volume data. What I've noticed is that most of the people talking about it don't actually know the difference between those datasets. And many assume that it's some kind of long term short position - which it may or may not be. 

There's also lot of bs about hurting market makers like Citadel Securities. Market makers don't care if the stock goes up or down. They make money when there's a market to be made - ie. that's why they are called market makers. 

For me - GME is simply an interesting exercise into mob mentality. I'll continue to extract premium income from trading GME whenever there is high volatility but what I'm doing is not investing.

Beginner 401k question here. I make around 100k annually and do not reasonably expect to make more than 140k annually in the future. 

I currently have my 401k contributions set to 7% 401k and 3% 401k roth.

Should i even bother with the roth at all? Or just set it all to 401k only? (I separately max out the 6k annual contributions to my roth IRA).

I can think of many:

- Disney suspended it's dividend, and it remains suspended even as they are turning a profit the last couple quarters and things reopen. They can easily pay their dividend, Many investors are pushing to keep it suspended,  because they think it is better spent investing in growing their streaming platform than back to shareholders.

- Western digital suspended its dividend last March. It remains suspended even as they grow earnings, because they want to focus on paying off debt and growing the company. They could easily pay the dividend if they wanted.

-LUMN(formerly centurylink) has reduced its dividend twice. Their CEO has said that the cuts were not necessary, but shareholders are better served by them paying down debt than with dividends.

- AT&T has commonly been regarded as a blue chip, their dividend is getting cut with the new Discovery merger going on.

- Many companies that once seemed like stable blue chips had to cut dividends due to changing market conditions with the pandemic, ie Boeing. From a defective product to a pandemic that killed demand, it just shows the risk of investing in individual companies, even if they seem safe.

>Dividends are meant to be reliable and cutting it for a discretionary reason shows mgmt is unreliable.

No, it shows that management believes shareholders are sometimes better off when a company doesn't pay a dividend. Suppose shareholders can expect a 7% ROI from investing their dividends. If a company believes they can generate a 25% ROI for shareholders from expanding their company, why wouldn't they cut the dividend to fund this?

Dividends are irrelivant to investment returns. When a company pays a dividend, the price of the stock decreases the same amount. Dividends only make sense when the company has excess cash they cannot generate a better return internally with.

Focusing on dividend payers can be nice in that the relative consistency of dividends reduces your urge to panic sell and reduces concerns about price fluctuations. But diversification is important as it boosts risks-adjusted returns.",,

I'm looking to finally move my stocks off of RH into a new brokerage (thinking Fidelity) and had a question about how I file. I am currently collecting Unemployment as my store shut down for Covid and never reopened. The thing is they still haven't made any attempt to call or email me and ""fire"" me or permanently let me go, and I've just been letting UIE ride (since it's the same i was making anyway). Part of the sign up for Fidelity asked if you are employed, and I wasn't sure if I'm still considered ""employed"" by my previous company, or if I can file as Not Employed. I obviously don't want it to effect my current UIE or anything like that, so I'm just trying to be extra cautious before I start.

Both require being right about a prediction which people have been consistently wrong about for the last 30 years. I’m not saying I think anyone should buy a long term treasury right now, rather that it can be a fools errand to try and time when to buy them. What was the consensus on long treasuries in the few years prior to COVID? Someone who bought in at “a bad time to get into bonds” experienced a benefit. I would say, backtested the last 50 years and if you like the path of a portfolio with long treasuries in it to smooth the ride better, then make that your plan and don’t try to time it.

Yes, you’re taking cash off the balance sheet of the company and distributing it to the owners. For growth investors, that’s a drag, for income investors (the majority of the investment world), that’s a HUGE PLUS THAT PPL CONSISTENTLY PAY A PREMIUM FOR. 

Why has AGNC traded at a 15%+ premium to NAV the last 46 out of 48 months?? Are all these investors just really dumb and you know something as simple as “they pay dividends out of their cash balance” that they don’t know?? Lol. And all the institutions that own high yield dividend stocks or CEFs?? Check your premises, bud. 

Dividends used to be the sole reason to invest in a company, but the role of dividends has changed a lot in the last few decades, to where the market values stock buybacks, MnA, and RnD instead of dividends. But as an investor, dividends are the bread and butter. 

PS- And you’re wrong about taxes: I pay the long term cap gains rate on my dividends, you pay the short term cap gains rate on your premium.

2. Vanguard Sp500 expense ratio is .03%, while expense ratios for levered ETFs hover closer to 1%. The fact that you're comparing the two shows how little you know. 

You linked an article that literally disproved your own thesis. Again I quote:

""The return of the leverage = 2 ETF has been reduced to that of a fee-free leverage = 1 ETF. So all the benefits of leveraging have been lost.""

Secondaries make more pie pieces and sell them to new people - in theory it shouldn't affect share price if sold at a fair price, but in practice, a lot of times secondaries are from a position of weakness and desperation.

Tesla did both last year. The split seemed to boost the price a bit, in this case there are practical issues in buying and selling shares that are in the hundreds of dollars each - lots of people, myself included, can not buy fractional shares (nor want to). My personal pet peeve is when some companies do 3-for-2 splits... WTF... PITA for math, and it doesn't really make the shares more accessible.

The secondaries Tesla did did not hurt the share price at all really... they sold shares for a lot of money for relatively little dilution, at a time when they didn't strictly need more cash, but it's quite handy to have billions in the bank when they are spending billions on multiple new factories. The alternative to selling new shares would have been issuing more debt eventually. Both would have been fine at the time.",,

Mid twenties, can tolerate risk, but I gotta admit I am scared that correction happens just a little after I put money into stocks funds (I know I should not time the market, this feeling is just inevitable). 

I would be setting aside another % in liquid cash and bonds (not completely sure about the % yet). I do not plan on touching the index fund money in 10-15 years.

I'll add a few of my notes for OP. Just a few things I noted:

* US has outperformed the world and Europe the last few decades.

* Valuations based on P/E have been incorrect so far and that's why value investors have been getting killed on the markets ([and literally](https://www.barrons.com/articles/legendary-value-manager-charles-de-vaulx-found-dead-51619564407)) the last couple of decades. 

* One reason why those traditional valuations didn't work is because high valued growth tech has been disrupting the traditional value stocks. GOOG with traditional media, AMZN with SEARS, NFLX on T, and TSLA on the autos.

* Judging by how things are going now. I still believe US will be the tech leader over most countries. Maybe not specific regions like Asia Pacific, but if you're buying a basket of the world then the US will likely outperform it in the area of tech. 

I believe that tech leadership coupled with growing population demographics, stability of the legal/financial systems, and strong global position allow the US to maintain it's strong gains as further disruptions continue. More innovative than Europe. More stable than China or India. More resources than the rest of Asia Pacific. 

I will note that there is a this perception that there is more upside gains investing overseas in the case of potential upside not from technology or valuations, but just from the amount of upside and current cost of the US equity market at the moment. Some markets like those in EU, London, Brazil,  the rest of LatAM, and others have been laggards and might have a short term outperformance rally relative to US equities.

**""The New Warrants may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.""**

I didn't know what this meant, so I looked it up.  It means you don't have to have the$10 per share to exercise the warrant.  They will take it out of the proceeds from converting all the warrants. Ask your broker if they participate.

**Example:** 

You have 1000 shares at $6 a share. Your investment is $6000.

You first receive $2.53^(1) per share. So cash payout of $2530.

Then, you receive 1040^(2) warrants for the shares with a strike price of $10^(2).

The new stock is trading at $15 a share. (Estimate from the plan)

Your brokerage exercises the warrants in full with zero cash from you.

You now have 1040 shares of new stock at $15 a share for a total value of $15,600.

But, you owe the strike money that the brokerage put up for you of $10 a share.

You owe $10400. $10400 divided by 15 is 694.

They sell and take 694 shares to repay your strike money.

Leaving you with 346 shares worth $5200.

$5200 in stock + $2530 in cash = $7730.

A profit of $1730 or 28% ROI.

860,gzokm4o,2021-05-27 20:56:40,t1_gzokm4o,t1_gzoc6k1,investing,"short answer is yes,  but long answer might be more helpful for others who haven't researched any of this:

VTI tracks the broad US stock market as it is actually weighted. It is a good baseline/core position especially when added to  VXUS which is its ""except US"" global market counterpart.  The world stock markets are right now about 66% US for actual weighting.  VOO tracks S&P 500 which is an overweight to Mega Cap US, which right now, in this part of this bull market is IMO a good overweight.  VXF is everything US besides S&P so it is a complement to VOO; you can build VTI out of VOO+VXF.  what % you assign everything is up to you, but S&P 500 represents about 71% of US market cap today.  

The global market has historically produced good inflation beating returns on every 30 year period measured, which leads to the reasoning that time in the market is better than ""timing the market.""  One way to beat ""the market"" is to put wise overweights in place that outperform the broader market during a given market cycle.  this particular bull has seen Tech, Health Care and US outperform.  the final third of bull markets (which is what I think we are in) lends itself to outperformance from mega cap and consumer discretionary.

Despite bonds being part of everyone's standard advice, the macro for bonds has never been worse with interest rates sitting so low.  if interest rates go up, current bonds become worth less in principal to traders, so they can, and likely will, lose money instead of just returning income.  For investors with long time horizons (20+ years) they tend to be a portfolio drag rather than an enhancement.

what you outlined as holdings above, depending on % can be used to model the stock market.  rebalance annually, off you go.",,

I know there are some crazy people out there that claim that trading IS A SCAM!!! can you believe it!!!!

Anyways... I just found the best way to do trading and you can literally make a 250k profit in a FEW minutes! OMG im cuming

First of all you will need a small loan of 500k, it can be from your parents, friends, family or bank. Whoever suits you best.

Then you will need to follow this easy-to-follow-easy-steps:

\-Buy 500k of ILoveHorseShit coin

\-Wait a few minutes till the coin price explodes! You can also insert a dildo in your asshole while you wait (highly recommended)

\-The price will drop by 50%, but don't worry you still have 250k

\-Block your parents/friends/family/bank number

\-Move to Panamá

Guys easiest 250k of your life! I love doing traiding.

Take care you little traders.

After you have secured your savings, put on a suit, take a picture in the beach looking at your computer and post it on instagram. Dont worry, if somebody asks you how those graphics work, you think of something in the moment and end up your phrase with ""thats the oversimplified explination... now excuse me, this trades are not gonna be done by theirselves😎""",nmiutj,Best not fake trading legit method working 2021!

954,,2021-05-27 22:03:07,t3_nmiv3k,,investing,"Hey all,

I have been working on my own stock screener, and in the process have wanted to track ETFs vs their underlying holders to identify gainers/losers.

I had been trying to find a way of automatically pulling through ETF holdings with =importhtml etc, every post I found on Reddit related to the issue faced the same problem that holdings were pulled on websites by javascript and couldn't be easily pulled through to a spreadsheet.

Then, I found this website, and I must admit I've been pleasantly surprised with it! https://fknol.com/

For those of you who found this post looking for a way of pulling ETF holdings through, on google sheets it's:

    =IMPORTHTML(""https://fknol.com/etf/holdings/""&A1&"".php"",""table"",1) 
    
In A1 you'll have your ETF ticker

To make it neater expand the formula to:

    =index(IMPORTHTML(""https://fknol.com/etf/holdings/""&A1&"".php"",""table"",1),,2)
    
This will just pull through the column with the holding info

Assuming the above formula is in A2, you can use this formula in B2 to extract tickers automatically:

    =IF(A2="""","""",left(right(A2,len(A2)-find(""("",A2)),find("")"",right(A2,len(A2)-find(""("",A2)))-1))


With excel there's a guide [here](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/anna-prosvetova/web-scraping-made-easy-import-html-tables-or-lists-using-google-sheets-and-excel). you can use index & the function to extract tickers as above.

Anyway, having looked through the site briefly, it's worth having a poke around the website as the information looks really good to be honest!",nmiv3k,Great website to view ETF holdings & easily import into google sheets/excel

As far as I know, actively managed mutual funds don't do day trading, but more of something like rebalancing their portfolio on a monthly basis.

Any recommendations?",nmj4pp,How can one invest in people/funds that trade frequently & aggressively?

B) most platforms allow for reinvestment of dividends while RH doesn’t so you end up getting screwed on capital gains twice C) the commissions and purchasing of stock on the platform are not great. The platform has restrictions on purchasing certain stocks/crypto/options and the purchasing g at price points is way off. 

Better to go with Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or a major platform",,

My wife switched from Robinhood to Schwab, and Robinhood made it a royal pain in the ass and didn't even provide Schwab with her cost basis. She had to go and do it manually.
