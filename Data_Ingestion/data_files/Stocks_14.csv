For example, a glazier that is a client was looking into buying six gray market small trucks found they carry two workers, about 200# of tools, plus whatever glass they're carrying.  A Prius drive train will easily handle that. It's not like most small trucks are typically carrying a huge load of wood to build a house or pulling a trailer with a backhoe.  If you are, then you buy a F-250.

As far as FWD goes, unless you're carrying quite a bit of cargo, trucks often have trouble with traction.  Here in Seattle with steep  hills, slick concrete, and rain, pickups can be a lot of trouble to drive.  I don't drive a truck often, but I once got stuck on Spring St right in the middle of downtown.

It’s between *human driving aided by driving assistance systems* and self driving.

The cooperation of a human driver with specific safety-oriented driving assistance systems, like driver fatigue and attention monitoring, emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, set a much higher bar for Self Driving to meet because it can be considered the safest option.

This combination, with today technology, is the gold standard of driving safety. And that’s what responsible car manufacturers are offering.

FSD is a bag of hype, it doesn’t currently exists, and going from interviews with people in the field it’s still a long way off.

Suggesting that cars today can drive themselves is irresponsible. Tesla’s system should be named in a way that’s totally unequivocal on the fact that it’s not self driving.

Selling a car on the promise that someday will be full self driving (remember the nonsense Teslas cars being appreciating assets because owners will make money sending them out as robo taxis?) is a scam.

I don’t know the numbers, just putting the comparison in perspective.

Besides, that comparison was made jokingly, overly focusing on that indicates a desire to make a point at any cost.

Example Fund A buys a share

Short Seller B borrows that share and sells it to Fund B.

Both A and B are institutions and if those are the only two shares that exist the company is now 200% held by institutions.

Remember institutions can be anyone from other hedge funds to any of the companies running mutual funds or ETFs etc.  Theoretically there could be a squeeze if all of the institutions recalled their shares and refused to sell but that is not likely since the institutions are many and very diverse.

If you add that institutional ownership up, it is more than the shares issued by Gamestop. Part of that is the extra 10million shares that have been borrowed and sold again.

 The remaining extra (what we can call the shares that retail hold) were likely created by the process of naked short selling by the designated market maker for GME, which is Citadel (who happened to give an original short seller Melvin 2b during the initial squeeze to prevent margin call). (Important to note that Citadel has been fined multiple times for naked short selling)

Though this is not my area of expertise my gut tells me that it will fail long term in its current form. It might get legalized for a short while (as a political play), but that will get reversed if not by law, then by the companies themselves in due time. Long term outlook is it will require a human behind the wheel at all times.

Just thinking about how they are defined/identified, it seems reasonably likely that double tops would appear in the formation of an upward triangle, yet they indicate almost completely opposite things.

The Prius has the 1.8l gas engine paired with an electric battery powered hybrid system. It makes 121hp at 5200 rpm. It has 105ft-lbs of torque. Most common drive trian is FWD and second is their awd system which is not full time. It comes standard with a Continuously Variable Transmission and is the only option. 

Based on the specs above, the drive train would work in a small truck but it would have little to no tow capacity. The Prius by itself can pull 3500lbs maximum, this includes people and gear in the car. I'm not saying it wouldn't work but it would such a niche market, why not just put this tech into a toyota tacoma with increase batteries and towing capacity. Tacoma tows up to 6800 with a payload of 1058lbs

As for fwd/rwd/awd/4x4, if you're in Seattle with slippy weather tires play a huge factor. A truck running on summer tires versus wet/rain or winter tires is going to have a huge factor on grip. Hell even all seasons and all weather's are different. I figure, most work trucks you see are running in the cheaper All Weather tires which perform much worse in wet conditions. All weather tires perform well when it's warm and wet versus cold and wet. The tire compound hardens up below 55 degrees normally (some garden below 60 degrees). 

What truck were you driving when you got stuck? Do you know what tires the truck had?

Most estimates I've seen for the current betting handle in the US is somewhere in the range of $180-$250B between legal and illegal bets. On an assumed 6-8% take home that makes total revenue $10.8-$20B in its current structure. This doesn't take into account all of the growth opportunities you mentioned as well as people who want to bet but don't have access/choose not to use illegal sites as. Also, in-venue betting in MD and AZ (already legal is DC and IL) was recently legalized and more states will likely follow suit. Also, while it won't be a monumental amount, Canada is getting closer to single game wagering which will likely add a side pot to revenue.

Also, growth in betting in the US has not slowed. Nevada (an established market for decades) is showing 15% growth from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4. New Jersey showed over 50% growth in that same time.

It's difficult to pinpoint where US revenue is eventually going to land but I don't think $9.5B is even in the ballpark. 

Also, wherever margins land is going to be incredibly difficult to predict. William Hill for example got hit hard with branch closures and UK restrictions on kiosk betting even before COVID. DraftKings and most other US entrants are clearly putting a higher emphasis on mobile betting.

I don't disagree with the point of OP that DraftKings is aggressively valued, it is. But I think that's justification behind it.",,

* KO products are likely not going away in the next 50 years. 
* KO has a strong worldwide manufacturing and distribution network.
* Lately, they are divesting lower margin operations and turning them over to 3rd parties (bottling). This will increase margins at the cost of rev.
* Generally they grow and adapt by creating or buying new drinks but they generally havent diversified outside of drinks. This not necessarily a bad thing just that they are more cyclical as the pandemic proved.
* Their rev was hit pretty hard by COVID due to restaurant closures. It will likely climb moving forward.
* Historically dividend keep growing and there is little danger in losing it.
* Historically they are a net share buyback company which is also good.
* Total return the last 10 years is about 8.5% annualized.

I would say this is a good purchase. 8.5% is pretty good given that this was a rather slow decade for them. That said, PEP is outperforming them right now thanks to their diversification into snacks. I also like KDP due to their dominance in coffee. At the same time, consider that KO has a stronger brand than the other two and will likely make a nice post covid recovery.

Going forward, I think the markets are either going sideways or down. I dont see much upside without major inflation. These 3 stocks are a great play during a sideways market and generally outperform in a crash due to safety. Inflation doesnt really hurt them very much because they can pass on the cost easily to customers. All in all, I would buy all 3.",,

There are a huge host of people in investing (and in these comments) who love to sound like the smartest guy in the room and they usually like to jump on a bandwagon until it becomes so overcrowded they feel special jumping off. That's how I've felt about Ford for years. Investors declared American manufacturing dead and so naturally Ford was dumped because they didn't move as much overseas. Then everyone had to double down when Ford stayed afloat by pointing out ""flaws"" that are no worse than most companies out there and it still struggled. The part that really killed is that Ford hasn't done a lot of diversifying or innovation that would make headlines so it became all the easier to dump. 

Which brings me to the bandwagon. I'm noticing an increase in investors naysaying sentiment stocks that are inflated on hype rather than numbers. TSLA has quickly become a target rather than the darling it once was and the more Musk makes a fool of himself or acts outrageous, the more investors like to poke at company issues (that have, ya know been there all along). Already I'm seeing a few analysts and investors drooling at the prospect of Ford hitting Tesla in the profits as a decent competitor. If they can rally that sort of hipster support and if Ford can keep making the news it'll help propel the stock to decent levels",,

Firstly. You have a tiny portfolio. The dividents that will get paid out won't amount to anything noteworthy. Sure if you have 300k, then holding 300k worth of a 4% dividend stock is nice. 

Secondly. You said you want to reinvest the dividents. Well then it makes no sense to go for a stock or ETF that pays out dividents. Accumulating stocks/ETFS basically take the dividents and re-invest them for you automatically, with the benefit of skipping taxation which increases the compound interest effect.

You should not invest with money that you know you will need in the short-term(3-6 months for me at least), the money you are investing should be extra money that you don't even need if there's an emergency.

Gambling is perfectly OK and fun but that is a 4rd savings that is beyond your budget, emergency fund and investment fund. Did you skip vacation or stop spending entertainment money for a month or 2? Take a shot with that cash. Then if you win, most goes into the investment account and you can gamble with the same amount that started with. If you win take a break from gambling for a month or 2 and park the money in a safe etf bc it's not easy and you could develop bad habits if you get lucky right away and keep trying.

896,gyyvr7s,2021-05-21 17:59:02,t1_gyyvr7s,t1_gyypxfh,stocks,"Sure thing. I look at a few things for miners. $KL stands out due to it's industry leading gross profit margin (72% vs 42% for $GOLD), EV/EBITDA of 5.95x vs 7.04x, and fortress balance sheet ($7 billion in assets vs just $532 million in current liabilities) vs $GOLD ($8.8 billion vs $2.3 billion in liabilities). Aso should look at free cash flow generation and AISC (All-in sustaining costs) for miners.

From the article that put me on to this company -

> Kirkland Lake Gold released its preliminary Q1 results earlier this month and reported gold production of ~302,800 ounces, a massive beat vs. its ~280,000-ounce guidance for the period. On a year-over-year basis, production was down from ~330,900 ounces, but it's important to note that this quarter included ~28,600 ounces of gold production from its Holt Mine, which is now on care & maintenance. If we adjust for Holt, production was up in the period.

>At Kirkland Lake's Detour Lake Mine, production was up more than 6% year-over-year due to higher throughput of ~5.72 million tonnes at a higher grade of 0.87 grams per tonne gold (0.84 grams per tonne gold in Q1 2020). Despite similar grades, recovery rates were up 110 basis points year-over-year to 92.2% and above Q4 levels as well (91.8%). It's important to note that this mine is just in the early innings of ramping up into one of the largest mines globally

>Finally, from a cash flow standpoint, Kirkland Lake is set to generate over ~$1.10 billion in free cash flow this year, translating to a free cash flow yield of nearly ~12%, while paying a dividend of nearly 2.00% at current levels. This is a very attractive valuation for a business with industry-leading 55% all-in sustaining cost margins. Besides, Kirkland Lake has the flexibility to grow its dividend, continue its buyback program, and even consider a small bolt-on M&A acquisition that would grow production and or reserves with zero share dilution. This is an enviable position to be in, given that most producers are forced to grow through share dilution and aren't sitting on ~$800 million in cash with no debt.

None of this is to say that $GOLD is a bad bet though. There are several valuation metrics you can look at that would make $GOLD look better (ie Market Cap/Free Cash flow for $KL 17.23x vs $GOLD 15.86x, etc.) I view $KL as having the highest potential for upward price movement due to their industry leading profit margins because they will be able to capture a greater amount of the inflation of golds value",,

1. You cannot use US valuation on another country. Thats a fatal mistake. Dont do that. It must be compared to other companies in China.
2. Alibaba has no competitive advantages. They are 3rd party dominant and all of their sellers list elsewhere and since there is no real estate limit to selling online...
3. I dont think margins are sustainable. Historically, their margins are very high for a retailer but recently there are some signs of them shrinking, probably due to heavy competition and the fact that they have no exclusivity (see #2 above).
4. Alibaba has a bad reputation. Too many knock offs, illegal products and bad sellers. Their policies are also not customer friendly and too easy for sellers to game.

Now all that said, their growth speaks for itself and their mountain of cash is enticing. So I do agree that there is value here and certainly potential once the cash is deployed. 

If I were them, I would take that cash and spend it outside of Chinese influence. From what I have seen, it seems to me that they are specifically targeting Ma probably because they see him as one of few people who can threaten the CCP politically. So they are likely suppressing him in a effort to diffuse his power. Im not saying this is wrong or right nor am I playing the socialism vs capitalism card, but I am just pointing out the differences between countries. Which brings us back to point 1 above.",,

Amazon said it's discontinue its stand-alone Prime Now app and website this year.

The service launched in 2014 as a way for Prime members to get one- or two-hour delivery on a range of goods, from household essentials and books to toys or groceries.

Shoppers will still be able to get fast delivery on the Amazon app or site.

This is actually a good news. Some of my friends have been doing this before the pandemic and they said amazon is losing money due to this program. So Amazon is continually to focus more on the bottom line, and that consolidation from Sep 2020 until now cause the pe ratio dropped to a reasonable level.

As someone who’s driven basically only older cars in my life last year I drove a 2019 civic (I think?) on a road trip and was amazed at the lane assist.
