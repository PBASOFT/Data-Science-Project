I think they have failed to establish that as being a positive. The US for many years had no governing body for its currency and as a result every state was minting its own and that was a disaster; so much so we replaced that system with a governing body. The banking houses of Europe used to mint bank specific currency and that was a disaster; so much so that centralized governing bodies got created. The crypto community has yet to make a compelling case for why this time is different.",,

Bottom line, ""building wealth"" is just that. A steady process. You're at a major advantage where if your living expenses are $2k/month, that's only $24k/year out of your $125k current salary. You can be investing $80-100k/year, which is huge.

What's going to burn you is trying to get rich quick. You found a taste of this via crypto and lost on Dogecoin and it's recent dump. That's the thing - crypto is volatile and risky, but if you get in when one's low and sell high, you can make a killing. Let's say you dumped $25k into Dodge at 0.005 cents and sold at .60 cents. The same goes for a lot of single stocks.

IMO, you're not doing bad just going into the S&P for now. Your real money maker is going to be what you're putting in, amassing a good chunk in there over a few years, and letting that ride. The compounding will take off at some point.

However, you may still want to section off 10-15% of your investing for more risky investing like crypto and single stocks. You can make a buck here and quick, but just expect to lose out too.

My advice would be have different tiers of investing. Max out your 401k and put it into a target date fund and be done with it. For retirement, you're set then. Below that might be other mutual funds you're heavily investing in, taxed of course, but still things like the S&P, overall stock market, dividend growth style funds. This would be for cash you want to have pre-retirement, but still a ways off.

Then tier 3, the risky ones. Like crypto and single stocks. 5-10% of your NW. Play with it, have fun, figure it out. Expect to lose here, but also maybe make a bit.",,

Slow compounding interest is what makes people rich. Not super risky investments (even though there can be a place for those in your portfolio, I certainly have a few in mine). 

Investing in the S&P 500 I believe gives you an average return of 6% a year. If you start at age 24 and you have an initial 150,000$ invested into the S&P, with an extra $1000 investment at the end of each month, and you repeat this process until you're 65, you'll have **$3,871,649** invested, from which only **$150,000** is initial cost, and only **$492,000** are monthly deposits. That's quite the retirement. If you factor in a 3% inflation rate and rise in monthly deposits every year, it'll be **$4,966,725.** If you do it until you're 75 instead of 65, it'll be **$9,658,551**. Patience and compound makes you rich.   


You can crunch the numbers yourself depending on your situation:  
[https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)  


Even if your income is way less (this previous example was for a guy making 120k$ a year), it can be super effective if you start early and keep compounding throughout your life. Different variables would make it look like this.

Initial deposit: $50,000  
Interest rate: 6%  
Years: 41 (until you're 65?)  
Deposit per month: $500  
Future investment value: **$1,644,922**  
Factoring in 3% annual inflation rate and thus 3% higher deposits every year, it's be 2.1m dollars by the time you can retire.",nh2lpw,The Power of Compounding Interest

I disagree, fundamentally, to the extent that ""use"" is divorced from ""store of value."" BTC \*has\* intrinsic value. It's coded into the software itself. This is unlike the dutch tulip craze, where the intrinsic value of the asset deviated from the market price.

So, again, if we limit it to the short term, I would agree that BTC is a risky, speculative growth asset. But that's just a side-effect of its growing pains. Major institutional players have been pouring hundreds of millions of $ into BTC. The financial web is solidifying, and with it, will come stability.

Though, I have to ask, what effect does this have: ""the amount of actual money in the system is a tiny fraction relative to the unbacked stablecoins inflating the market""?

>Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

>The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

>Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

>The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

>To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index. The Fed is more focused on the chart below than the chart above—and the bond market should be too.

“Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines. Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie. These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.” -New York Attorney General Leticia James

Pea brained take, basic logic tells you correlation does not equal causation.  How do you explain the rise in BTC from 2009-2017 then?  Stablecoins have been needed and predicted to happen since like 2013, it's a market need.  As crypto gains more adoption > more stablecoins are needed.  Simple logic man.

Meaning, they found some suspicious stuff.  But clearly didn't think it was worth prosecuting over.  They got a slap on the wrist and life went on.  2016-2017 tether got in trouble, but at the time they were a small % of crypto trading.  They've since resolved the issue.

First off, most people don't experience that. I know people who can't even open a bank account (and I live in the U.S. of A.). So there's that.

I personally hold Bitcoin as a store of value. I own stocks and mutual funds and I also have Bitcoin. So far, Bitcoin has outpaced my other savings devices. So I'm not going to talk theoretical, it's a simple fact of my life.

As far as banking and exchange of value (another function of money), I can get a loan through crypto, but I can't get a loan through a bank (which is a service a bank should be able to provide). The UI on the infrastructure will improve over time. 

Do you use Venmo? PayPal? CashApp? Why would you use any of these instead of a traditional bank?

This is why I suggest you read a little history. America wasn't kicking in the 1400s. Meanwhile the 1970s wasn't that long ago. The U.S. stopped being a gold standard for citizens in the 1930s, but stopped for other countries 40 years later, so think about how long these things take to percolate and are on the scale of about 500 years.

It's been the case for a few years here in Denmark. They just keep lowering the amount for which you *don't* pay negative interest (ie: you get 0%). Now it's 100k DKK (13400€). Beyond that it's -0.7%.

The thing is though, as soon as the bank interest is below 2% or so, it's essentially negative compared to inflation anyway. The negative sign in front is more psychological than economic.

There is an excellent white paper by S.N. which describes in excellent detail why a relatively low transaction limit is needed to preserve a distributed currency. If over 100 years the blockchain grows to the point where it can only be stored and run in data centers and not validated by individual users then you do not actually have a a distributed network.

Increasing the block limit by 10x or 100x would destroy the advantages it was meant to have in the first place... recreating banks all over again.

And given your level of understanding up until now, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that you think the cap on coins and on transaction limits are somehow different. Changing either would create a hard fork, but they can both be changed by consensus of the network. A consensus that is unlikely to be reached on the transaction cap because it destroys the assurances that future consensus will be from a truly distributed rather than centralized controlled entities.

I legitimately cannot comprehend how anyone can look at the price action of any cryptocurrency and conclude that it functions as a ""store of value."" A store of value shouldn't lose 25% of its purchasing power overnight for no reason. Nor should it appreciate 200% in a year. 

>BTC \*has\* intrinsic value. It's coded into the software itself. 

This is a circular statement that proves nothing. 

>So, again, if we limit it to the short term, I would agree that BTC is a risky, speculative growth asset. But that's just a side-effect of its growing pains. Major institutional players have been pouring hundreds of millions of $ into BTC. The financial web is solidifying, and with it, will come stability.

I've been hearing this same argument for 12 years and absolutely nothing has changed. 

>Though, I have to ask, what effect does this have: ""the amount of actual money in the system is a tiny fraction relative to the unbacked stablecoins inflating the market""? Stablecoins are pegged to the underlying fiat currency, which \*doesn't\* bear the same characteristics as BTC and other cryptos.

I used to invest in physical silver. I still have some. It's pretty neat to have a couple of bars and shiney coins, but that's basically where the benefits stop. Physical PMs are a pain in the ass to transact in -- bid / ask spreads are VERY wide at local dealers and at big online retailers. In order to get good execution you almost always have to sell online which takes time and effort (meeting people from craigslist, taking risks mailing money and metals through the mail, or driving to meet people at banks). Running eBay auctions put you at risk during bouts of volatility as auctions take days to complete. Moving houses or apartments with a bunch of bars and tubes of silver was also kind of a pain. Depending on how big your stack is / gets storage can become an issue too.

In hindsight I quickly regretted going the bullion route. SLV is just so much easier. The one exception is if you're going the buillion route because you like the collecting aspect of things (think numismatics, buying rounds or bars with historical context or interesting artwork), but if this is your M.O. then you're not really investing, but rather pursuing a hobby.

and

>I've been hearing this same argument for 12 years, but I guess ""this time is different""?

12 years is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things for a fundamentally new type of currency. Literally nothing. Again, it boils to the short/long term distinction. 

And ""this time"" is different, just as every day is different, in the sense that the market cap has simply grown over time. I bet we can have this exact discussion 12 more years down the road, and you could still bring up the same arguments, but with the same trend for cryptos. 

>This is a circular statement that proves nothing.

To the extent you are implying there's a logical fallacy, you're simply wrong. That occurs if both the following statements are true: If A then B; and If B then A. BTC's intrinsic value as currency is a function of its portability, durability, fungibility, recognizability, durability, divisibility, acceptability, uniformity, and limited supply. Which, again, flows from the software itself. The reverse just makes no sense. The intrinsic value of BTC does not create those characteristics; it's the other way around.

>Because the peg is an absolute fiction. Only a vanishingly small fraction of tethers are backed by real money.

This is new to me (though I confess I don't really follow stablecoins). If true, then this merely reinforces the sentiment in my prior statement. Not only are stablecoins different from BTC et al, but the *reason* they are different (the peg) is now revealed to be a (partial) farce. 

That doesn't change any conclusions as to independently-valuable cryptos like BTC or ETH (which, because of its added utility, I like more than BTC).",,

If you can use something like copper/silver to mimic even 90% of the utility of gold then you wouldn't use gold in that process/item unless it's specifically to drive up value cost. The reason is because gold costs more. Gold costs more because it's rarer and harder to obtain. 

So it keeps boiling down to gold's rarity, availability, and costs to procure.

>I literally just cannot understand why any small personal investor would want to buy silver bullion when gram for gram there is the far more efficient option of gold?

As FP said, silver is more common than gold so it's more accessible and ends up having more liquidity and uses than gold. It's not the whole case, but if you want to simplify it then that's mostly the reason. For smaller investors BRK-B exists because they can't buy BRK-A.

Other investors choose to short the rarity of gold and commonness of silver. For example, the historic silver:gold ratio has been throw stray recently because the advent of electric vehicles and role silver plays in the batteries. Is it because gold can't be used? No. But humans never bothered to make disposable gold batteries because that would be expensive and stupid.

Think of it this way. You deposit money in your bank. Your bank lends that money out and makes a killing. Your bank returns to you 0.5% for the honor of lending them money. That should be illegal. DeFi does away with the middleman and you're lending your money in pools, which you and others can borrow from.

In other words ARK isn't ""the market."" And by choosing to invest in ARK, you are in many ways timing the market by choosing a certain set of stocks over others, and by having an active manager (Wood) try to time the market on your behalf with buy/sell decisions. 

Look at it this way; value investing, a style that encompasses a far broader set of stocks than ARK has been out of favor for almost two decades now, so the idea that you are owed a fresh ATH this year or even within 5 years is dubious based on what we know about investing styles going in and out of favor...to say nothing of ""hot"" actively managed fund strategies.",,

Data centers can become troublesome in the quest for decentralization because they’re often held by corporations. Node counts can also help skew public opinion through what are known as Sybil attacks. Sybil attacks can overinflate influence in a peer-to-peer system, making it appear there to be more consensus than the actual reality. These are real concerns for consensus networks like Bitcoin.

You need to pick what kinds of mutual funds you want to invest in before making an apples and oranges comparison. An S&P 500 Index fund is naturally going to have a low expense ratio, as there is little to no work involved in picking what stocks will be in the fund. It is the 500 largest companies on the NYSE, simple as that. The other fund you listed is a fund whose stocks have been specifically curated by the funds management. It targets stocks within a specific sector and then through qualitative, quantitative, and technical analysis the fund’s managers choose what stocks to include in the fund. There is way more work involved in this, which is one of the reasons the expense ratio is significantly higher. 

Decide first what kind of funds you want to by. Then compare expense ratios between funds of the same type. You are correct that of the two funds you listed, the Software and IT fund would beat the Index fund regardless of its expense ratio. But this is an apples and oranges comparison. If you instead compare the the Fidelity 500 Index Fund to something like the Fidelity ZERO large cap index fund (both are S&P 500 Index funds) Fidelity ZERO wins all day because it has a 0% expense ratio. 

Morale of the story, don’t put all of your eggs into the Software and IT fund just because it looks better at a glance. It may be beating the market, but it also comes with a much higher risk factor. Decide what types of funds you want to buy first based on your desired level of risk. Then compare the returns and expense ratios within funds of each type.

They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

So, anyway TL;DR : I’m a complete novice but would GREATLY appreciate some tips for investing $1-5,000.

So my parents passed away when I was very young, and as a result a trust account was set up in my name for a portion of the social security money received monthly. They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there’s $17,000.   
I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 in the US and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. I’m unemployed currently, but starting up again next month/July after having a health issue (paid for).   
After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would definitely suck, but I would be okay. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn. I don’t mind risking it, however I’d like to be at least somewhat confident and will do my research on suggestions to make the decision I believe in.   
I actually have a bit of Doge….as in I have like $50 worth. I bought it at $0.35, if that helps. And I only have one debt of $800 from being a stupid college kid who got a credit card for the first time while literally wasting money at an out-of-state school. I otherwise previously had $0 in savings so I’m just not willing to put any more than $5,000 in. That said,  if I come across or am suggested a stock I can really get behind and believe in I absolutely can and will invest it.  
If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it.   
So, anyway TL;DR : I’m a complete novice but would GREATLY appreciate some tips for investing $1-5,000.

I imagine the Fed raising rates based on overall positive signs might cause some chaos - stocks could sink but maybe housing demand increases further as people try to avoid missing out on historically low rates. And all the new homebuyers will be driving retail and durable goods sales. And possibly starting families because that's the ""next step.""

Try to see if any of those events have occurred and if management was correct in their hypothesis. This shows a sound understanding of the business. 

2) I would replace Debt with Debt Management. Debt is not inherently bad, but it must be used to further entrench the Moat of a business or increase earnings power proportionally more than the cost of servicing the debt. A great and often used bad example of this is AT&T. They have incurred piles of debt with little to no benefit to the earnings power of the company and in their case their debt actually weakened their Moat as it indirectly is responsible for the rise of TMobile as a legitimate competitor.

3) This is the toughest to judge IMO but in general you should prefer that management is paid in salary and not stock options, but simultaneously owns significant equity in the company. This guarantees that management is not incentivized to pump the share price or manipulate numbers to increase the options they receive while also giving them skin in the game so their primary focus is the long term health of the company. I suppose a private placement could be related to that but I think that would be more correlated to #2.",,

If you want a better back and forth debate on the subject, there were mountains of arguments written about the subject back during the “civil war” when BCH split off because it did so by doing exactly what you were suggesting.

Of course those arguments look very different now seeing how the results of that turned out. That’s why I say that the network consensus *could* change, but is unlikely, just like it *could* change to make the number of coins infinite... there is no hard and fast rule stopping that *except* for convention and the fact that people in the network already really really don’t want it to change and so any attempt to do so just creates a weak fork.",,

It is not surprising to me when I hear about certain companies that had scandals that, to others, seem to come out of nowhere, but time and again, I see bad decisions run rampant in organizations that do not stress integrity and accountability.

Now, can you know everything? No. But you can know pretty quickly which managers you wouldn't want to be associated with... reputations follow people around.  My aunt had a certain reputation in the telecom industry and it wasn't wrong.  So, when I saw that she stumbled over a key question from CNBC a day after her company's IPO, I knew they were in trouble.

The other thing to understand is that corporations are complex machines.  A car isn't a ""bad"" car just because someone once drove it recklessly.  It's a bad car if its fundamentals are bad... if its engine needs work.  If there's an idiot in the back seat of an otherwise rock solid car, the car will probably outlast the backseat driver.

Now, I haven't done any hard analysis but I would guess that because my focus tends to be steeply undervalued securities, how much or how little time I spent investigating management had very little bearing on the outcome of the investment... so I'm not really sure how much of that is worth the average investor's time.

It should be fairly evident from the financial history of a company whether management has been effective at producing optimal results while mitigating risk exposure.

723,,2021-05-20 20:31:42,t3_nhap36,,investing,"Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.",nhap36,Oatly Jumps in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO

Third - nobody is forced to invest in indexes. Investing in an index is a capitalist activity by default.

Currently, it's overvalued when measure by several different metrics.

Before someone pipes up with ""stocks always go up"" simplistic thinking - that thinking works if you have unlimited time and only trade in companies that don't go bankrupt and stay in the S&P.

If you bought and hold world.com in 2000, stocks didn't go up.

OP, you entered the market during one of its most volatile times when the money supply and deficit are off the charts while interest rates are at an all time low and there are new, big, unregulated investments (crypto) while there is an unprecedented influx of retail investors.

Nothing was normal about it. Nothing is normal about it now.

Recency bias is affecting a ton of investors, making them believe this is normal. They think it's normal to make a 20% return on a stock in a month. They think it's normal for companies to trade at 200+ times their equity or earnings. 

If you can't figure out why the market is doing what it's doing, it's because no one else can either. And I mean no one. I have friends who are money managers for Fidelity who say the same thing.

Right now, we are seeing indecision and worry.

If you don't want that indecision and worry in your life, then being out of the stock market is the solution.

I am 31 years old and am looking for some advice on how to invest in my ROTH IRA and 401(K). Both accounts are through Fidelity. I have decided to go with a [Three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio).

The first question I have is which fund(s) I should choose? I have narrowed my selections down to the following.

1. [**VT**](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vt/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0.08% and quarterly dividends with a yield of 1.83%.)

2. [**VTI**](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0.03% and quarterly dividends with a yeild of 1.4%) and [**VXUS**](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/vxus/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0.08% and quarterly dividends with a yield of 2.3%)

3. [**FZROX**](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fzrox/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0% and annual dividends with a yield of 1.47%) and [**FZILX**](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fzilx/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0% and annual dividends with a yield of 2.27%)

And, my second question is if I don't go with VT what domestic/international split should I use?

1. Global market-capitalization weight (~60% domestic/ ~40% international)


2. Tilting domestic

     2a. 70% domestic/30% international

     2b. 80% domestic/20% international

For the past few years my father has been managing most of my finances. From my holdings below you can see that a huge portion are in corporate bonds. They seem ""too good to be true"". For example, 50k is in [this particular one](https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form++424B2++++++MORGAN+STANLEY/18446847.html) which seem to have a ridiculous 19% interest rate, and is essentially betting that TSLA won't drop below $350, which seems highly unlikely.

*How old are you? What country do you live in?
28, USA.

*Are you employed/making income? How much?
Will be starting a PhD this year, so just enough income to meet expenses for the next ~5 years. Have enough money set aside as an emergency fund, a year's espenses, and to deal with settling in a different city.

*What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
Retirement savings. Maybe buy a house but don't really know where I'm going to end up. A house in Ohio is quite a different goal than a house in SF bay area.

*What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
No need for the money in at least 20 years.

*What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
Prefer safety

*What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
1. corporate bonds: 170k generating 15k-ish total net income a year. About half indexed to Tesla and half to SPX/RTY/NDX/
2. trad IRA: 6kAMD, 9k BABA, 17k NVDA, 7k FSMEX
3. stocks: 6k AMD, 5k IYH, 9k FSMEX
4. 403(b) and retirement plan: 6k in VEMPX, 8k in LIVKX

None. Do not expect expenses to exceed my stipend in the next few years.

Currency worries: 40% monetary debasement with trillions more to come, negative real yields, negative rates on some savings accounts, bank seizures like Cypress and Hong Kong, exploding sovereign debt

Macro forces: There's over 100T in bonds, 30T of which with negative real yield, whose principle is at risk as rates rise (a bond with 10y duration will lose 10% each percent). Enter 0.8T asset that doesn't debase, does great in inflation, is moderately uncorrelated, and is easy to custody. 

Debt trap: With the explosion in debt (and trillions more coming) the government owes $280B/year for each percent increase. If it got to 4% that'd be the equivalent of paying for a second US military. The government can't afford to let rates get that high and will have to implement some level of yield curve control which ultimately means dollar debasement. 

Sovereignty: Self custody optionality, no counterparty risk, 24/7 access, borderless, decentralized, publicly auditable. 

Yield: Blockfi, staking, and defi offer yields that absolutely crush savings accounts. 

Other arguments: 

* The [sound money](https://imgur.com/a/chbFIp5) argument. 
* The [network effect/metcalfe's law](https://twitter.com/raoulgmi/status/1347013577559990273) argument. 
* The [comparable asset](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) argument. 
* The [stock to flow](https://twitter.com/filbfilb/status/1363466784360321024) commodity argument. 
* The [moral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLYYh4aPXAM) argument. 
* The [sharpe ratio](https://imgur.com/a/eUHYmaQ) argument. 

For Bitcoin specifically: biggest computing network on the planet, the longest most secure blockchain, hardcore coder base, secured low cost clean energy infrastructure, facilities infrastructure, political inroads (donors, government members, advocacy groups), largest userbase, battle tested history, most legal due diligence, most investment vehicles, over the $1T minimum for the largest funds (pensions/etc) to start allocating, no [unpredictable monetary policy](https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png), institutional infrastructure (Paypal, Square, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, Melon Bank, Blackrock, CME, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity Digital Services, ETF/ETNs, Coinbase/Gemini Custody), corporate treasury buy in (Mass Mutual, Square, Microstrategy, Harvard/Yale/Brown Endowments), brand name...

Money was also just the first application. Beyond that there are projects for decentralized file storage, computation, data markets, community tokens etc. 

There are lots of different reasons for different people. The institutions and smart investors are thinking very macro while individuals are drawn more to the sovereignty and return aspects. Serious VC firms like a16z are investing in these decentralized apps.",,

That is, the cheap haystack is a better buy than the expensive attempt to dig through it, in part because, on average, those attempts fail. 

Using your example, the S&P 500 comparison is unfair: the difference in performance has to do mostly with sector/industry exposure, not active management. Compare it instead to VITAX, vanguard's IT index. It holds 331 companies (haystack), compared to FSCSX's 71. Keeping with what we would expect, the passive (ER .1%) index has outperformed the active one by 6% 1 year, 3% 3 year, and 3% 5 year. Fidelity did manage to beat it early and pull ahead by 0.8 percent over 10 years, but that difference is a) more likely due to luck than skill because manager skill is largely mythical and b) almost entirely erased by the difference in expenses.",,

891,,2021-05-20 21:57:34,t3_nhcpdw,,investing,"I’m no Warren Buffett, but I do know that crashes happen and what the Fed has always done to fix them which is print money and lower interest rates. Am I wrong about that? I’m sure there’s more to it but that’s the basic idea.

The US has added 10 Trillion in debt or more since 2008, most of that in the last year. People say inflation won’t happen and maybe they’re right. They do this for a living, btw.

But just say a recession or depression were to happen? No one really knows why it will happen or when, but what can the Fed do after printing 5T in the last year and having interest rates already at zero? Create trillions more on top of negative interest rates? 

The US has one of the top 3 highest household debt to GDP in the entire world. So when this crash happens, is the government going to give us all money to pay our visa bills? On top of unemployment and food stamps and healthcare? So what I’m saying is there would likely be a banking crisis again on top of whatever else might be going on.

What I’m saying is that next time there’s a lot less that they can do than they had the option to do just 13 years ago. Especially after the last year. 

And on top of that, we have a Democrat that wants to spend another 2T, raise taxes, and who thinks that we really need to be paying people extra to not work right now even though anyone who wants a job or vaccine can get one. 

I don’t know. I’m no economic genius but at least the government can always print more money to solve all our problems, right?",nhcpdw,The next crash will be the worst one I feel

For better or worse, it does take away some flexibility from the investor.  Also eliminates the ability for the investor to claim the foreign tax credit, but that's not an issue in a tax-advantaged account anyway.  VT really is a great ETF for starting investors to hold onto until complexity finds them and it makes more sense to slice and dice.  

Global market cap weighting (VT) is basically the neutral starting point that makes the most sense for most people.   Still, there are some arguments for tilting.  For example, some people overweighting emerging markets based on their collective GDP being much higher than the market cap weight the global index gives them, but it's debatable whether or not that's a good strategy.   A lot of people have a tilt toward their home countries because it makes sense for tax reasons, which makes sense for people with a lot of money invested, not so much for new investors.   In the end, you do want global diversification in some way, so you're definitely on the right track.  

Vanguard wrote a whitepaper about why they recommend global market cap weighting (VT), and a lot of the other big firms are basically in agreement that global diversification is important.  Here is the paper if you really want to get into the weeds:  https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGGEB.pdf",,

Though I agree this will be a challenge, especially from a regulatory perspective, given how decentralized networks work. I have no idea how regulators could possibly approach it, I have no experience in this particular field, I just hope they will remain constructive and not ignore the benefits this tech brings.",,

Unfortunately, in order for it to be a currency it needs to be backed by a government/country, and in order to be a good/stable currency it needs to be backed by a country with economic power and nukes/military.  No major country is going to consider any crypto a valid currency - it will never happen. They enjoy and will always have their central banks.  If any country develops their own crypto, it will have a back door so they can manipulate it...which is you guessed it -essentially a central bank.  The only reason the US has not outright banned any cryptos as of yet is because they haven’t been used as currencies in any real way...it acts as a stock and is treated as such by the IRS.

Welcome to the digital world, where everything can be bought 24/7 without leaving your house.

\-You can divide it.

Dafuq?

\-You know exactly how much of it exists in the world

Why would anyone give two shits about that?

\- and the rate at which that will increase. 

I mean, you will also know the rate at which the US dollar will inflate

\- You can transfer it over the internet. 

PayPal? God forbid I defend PayPal, but they're faster and cheaper than sending BTC

\- You can secure it in sophisticated ways at a low cost compared to other things.

My US dollars are pretty secure in a standard bank account...
