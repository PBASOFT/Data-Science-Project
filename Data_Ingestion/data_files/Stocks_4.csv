Some of my current holdings are not performing well, TSM is down, Pinterest is down a lot (100 shares @ ~64) I‚Äôve given back over 1500 of unrealized Apple profits and am now only marginally up (80 shares @ ~119 ) but I‚Äôm not looking at them and disappointed or pegging them as losers. The markets been weird for two months, the day to day stuff with the fed, interest rates, then inflation, plus the market rotation, it‚Äôs nothing but noise.

Low-interest rate means people can get a mortgage on a more expensive house. The major issue with that is the more expensive house ends up being the same house they would have ended up with at a higher rate.

In the end, they save no money on the mortgage. However, this does cause a jump in home prices. Honestly, buyers would be better off with a higher interest rate. Especially if they have a lot of cash on hand or can pay the mortgage off early. 

Low interest rates really benefit the seller, not the buyer. If you want to buy a house you should be hoping interest rates go up. Unless you have no cash and would never consider paying your loan off early. In which case it probably does not matter one way or the other.",,

It was easy for FB to grow from 1 million to 1 billion monthly active users (a factor of 1000). It's impossible for FB to grow from 1 billion to 1 trillion users (another factor of 1000), because this many people don't exist. It's also becoming very difficult for FB to grow revenue per user without losing users.

To grow more, they will have to invent all new sellable technology from zero, like Apple did with iPhone for example, and this is a lot harder to accomplish consistently and open to competition by new startups.

Furthermore, there is significant regulatory headwind coming up for the ad-tech companies (FB and Google), and potentially higher corporate taxes in multiple big markets.

Amazon and Microsoft are in a different league, and in my opinion have more room for growth because the move to cloud computing is not nearly complete yet, and there is no limit to how much cloud computing power a single human user might want or need in the future.

This list is by no means exhaustive....

Processing and memory density:
The Bekenstein bound limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area.

Thermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice, it is a stronger bound than the Bekenstein bound.

Processing speed:
Bremermann's limit is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass-energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints.

Communication delays:
The Margolus‚ÄìLevitin theorem sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 √ó 10^33 operations per second per joule. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amounts of energy/time per one elementary computation step.

Energy supply:
Landauer's principle defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: kT ln 2 consumed per irreversible state change, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature of the computer. Reversible computing is not subject to this lower bound. T cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 kelvins, the approximate temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation. However, on a timescale of 10^9 - 10^10 years, the cosmic microwave background radiation will be decreasing exponentially, which has been argued to eventually enable 10^30 as much computations per unit of energy.",,

Say a drop in interest makes it where the home ends up being 40,000 cheaper over the course of the 30-year loan. 

The 40,000 basically gets added to the sticker price of the home. So the house is now going to be 40,000 more expensive. 

But not quite because you would also be paying interest on the extra 40,000 too. So maybe you end up paying 35,000 more for the house and the other 5,000 would be interested in the 35,000. 

The issue is people like to max out what they can borrow. Lower interest means they can borrow more so they will pay more. The only thing stopping them from paying say 40,000 more is they can't borrow 40,000 more. When the bank says yeah you can have 40,000 more because of the lower interest. They spend 40,000 more. 

When the bank says now you can borrrow 40,000 less. They spend 40,000. 

 Since you will be competing with these people you will have to spend 40,000 more if they can borrow it. 

Or you can spend 40,000 less if they can't borrow it.",,

All our biological/neurological advantages are baked in and essentially maxed out. In aggregate, humans will never be meaningfully better drivers than we are now. Computer are not yet great at city driving, but are getting better and *will only* *get better* (barring an inevitable hiccup in the form of a Therac-25-style programming disaster, ETA 2027). 

Here's a counter-scenario. It is obviously not where we are at now, but it's where we are headed: 

  
Ok, so a soccer ball rolls out from between two cars. You, a human, have two eyes and they are pointed elsewhere, and/or you're thinking about something else, and/or you're distracted by another person or beeping thing in your own car, and/or you're tired, and/or you're old and have poor reflexes. You see the ball, but at a delay‚Äîyou stop but in the process a) you give the hypothetical lil tyke a love-tap resulting in a minor concussion and a major lawsuit and/or b) a car following you too close rear-ends you at somewhere between 0-35 mph, depending on their own confounding factors, because the same issues apply to them, people are impatient and self-centred, and they can't read your mind. 

  
Your car, an AI trained over several years at a rate of billions and then tens of billions of miles per year, has \~9 eyes arranged with full 360¬∫ coverage, redundant along the most important vector (ahead of you). They all feed data at a constant, manageable and predictable rate to dual redundant chipsets custom-designed for the task, at a faster FPS than humans can process. It is in constant communication with every car around you via a shared protocol designed to optimize the behaviour of unrelated vehicles in traffic and to coordinate reactions to unexpected events. Your car knows there's a meaningful chance that a child or dog follows that ball, because duh: this has happened literally millions of times in its training. It stops faster than you possibly could, and signals the car behind you to do the same, essentially in real-time. You probably avoid hitting the kid, but if you do it's at a much lower speed than you would have without a self-driving vehicle; ditto for your hypothetical rear-ender. If anyone hits anything the legal burden settles somewhere up the chain and isn't your problem. 

  
Like I said, this is not where we are but it is where we're going. The inflection point for cars outperforming human drivers in incidents/mile on highways has almost certainly already been passed by the most capable systems.

It's so easy to get caught up in worst-case scenarios and what-ifs and they need to be accounted for, definitely. But what about the possible upside? Don't we want the driving experience to become more frictionless (figuratively, of course), less fraught with biological, financial and moral hazards? Between human and AI, only one path leads to meaningful progress from where we are. We're not at an end-state unless we insist we are.",,

415,gynox5d,2021-05-19 04:11:14,t1_gynox5d,t1_gyn84ws,stocks,"Big thanks for the honest critique. I bought into Intel mostly because of its name. My impression of Intel going in was that it was a strong company with a solid credibility in the processor industry. That likely clouded my judgment when I read its earnings reports and compared it to AMD‚Äôs. I was aware that Intel had lost some ground, but for me at the time, it was a temporary hiccup. After all, it‚Äôs Intel, the king of microprocessors; why can‚Äôt they recover? Maybe it‚Äôs that same clouded judgment that‚Äôs making me hold it for the long run (or maybe it‚Äôs because it pays dividends, unlike AMD and Nvidia).

As for Moderna, consider it a major lesson learned. I‚Äôd successfully chased earnings for four straight stocks prior to Moderna (flipped both ATVI and AAWW on the same day for more than a $200 profit), so I was very much hyped for its earnings to get me some quick cash. Well, now I‚Äôm stuck with it until it crawls back up to 178 again because my stubborn ass refused to sell at a loss.

It's currently achieving that target (beat earnings and added 6M new subscribers to it's rebranded streaming service Paramount+ in the last quarter). 

It's currently trading at $40. Even if it recovers to $50 that's a nice 25% bump. If you're a bull at it goes to $60 that's a 50% bump. I see it as a great opportunity for value, and I think investor sentiment and interest will improve too with all these media mergers happening.

MAY 17, 2021 6:00AM EDT

Investors in software and data analytics group Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock have not had a good 2021 so far. Since the start of the year, PLTR stock is down about 15%. Its current market capitalization stands at $38 billion.

The company, founded in 2013, builds and deploys software platforms to businesses and governments worldwide, as well as U.S. federal agencies so that they can collect and analyze data to make better decisions. It has three main products: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. It operates a narrow-moat, as Morningstar analyst Mark Cash pointed out in his latest piece.

Following the direct public offering (DPO) in September 2020, PLTR shares more than quadrupled and hit $45 by late January. But then profit-taking kicked in. On May 11, following the release of first-quarter results, the stock went below $17. Now, it is hovering around $20.

What‚Äôs next for PLTR stock? If you are a long-term investor looking to add a high-growth name to your portfolio, you could consider buying the dips. Here‚Äôs why.

According to research from SAS, ‚ÄúBig data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities. That, in turn, leads to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits and happier customers.‚Äù

Investors expect software and data platforms like Palantir to capitalize on the growth of big data analytics. Its initial customers were mostly governments, starting with various U.S. federal agencies. However, 2020 also saw commercial contracts with metals miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and utility PG&E (NYSE:PCG). It also partnered with Amazon‚Äôs (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS unit.

The group‚Äôs Q1 results were robust. Total revenue jumped to $341 million, up 49% year-over-year (YoY). Its U.S. commercial revenue grew 72% YoY, and the U.S. government revenue grew 83% YoY.

The net loss was $123.5 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 4 cents. A year ago, it had been a loss per share of 1 cent. Adjusted free cash flow was $151 million, increasing $441 million YoY.

CFO Dave Glazer told participants on the earnings call that, ‚ÄúWith over $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet and strong free cash flow in Q1, we paid down our outstanding debt in early April‚Ä¶ For our Q2 revenue guidance, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of 43% or $360 million.‚Äù

For the 12 months that ended March 31, 2021, the company saw a 29% YoY growth in revenue per customer. The Street was pleased to hear that management believes it can grow 30% per year, in the coming next several years.

Glazer also commented on the possibility of Palantir‚Äôs adding cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet. In fact, the group already accepts Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) from its customers. 

For a company co-founded by Peter Thiel, the decision to become involved in financial technology (fintech) was to be expected. He was one of the names who set up PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Ona final note, we should note that despite the recent decline in price, PLTR stock is not cheap by traditional valuation measures. It trades for about 130x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 16x current price-to-sales (P/S). Therefore, the shares are likely to continue to be volatile in the short-term.

The Bottom Line on PLTR Stock

Big data is becoming increasingly more important for governments and commercial enterprises. Palantir‚Äôs recent results showed management has substantial long-term visibility. Although I‚Äôd not want to bottom-pick tech shares amid the continuing volatility, I find PLTR stock to be appropriate for long-term growth portfolios.

Finally, for investors who are interested in PLTR stock but are not ready to commit full capital into the shares, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Palantir shares could also be appropriate.

Examples include: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX) and the FlexShares Morningstar US Market Factors Tilt Index Fund (BATS:TILT).

I just think one month is far to short of a time frame to try and really label winners or losers for any position, let alone positions you picked while being fresh to the market. You're not day trading these picks, you think they could recover (and they may. I have hope, I like intel) but surely you didn't expect that to happen within a month, so why the regret? Why are you labeling it a loser at this point?  It's been a month in a weird market, let things play out a little bit. The comeback could be years in the making if Intel is able to pull it off, plus they do have a dividend as you note. 

Did you just guess those companies would have good earnings? Or what made you play those as earnings plays? Considering even good earnings have resulted in sell offs and things being ""priced in"" if you will, it seems like a tough thing to try and do consistently. If that's what you want to do, do it, but since the trade didn't work out, why hold it? Being stubborn is just tying your money up. Now I'm not saying to take the loss, but think about what you want to do, and that play in particular. If you want to trade earnings plays, are you going to hold every one that tanks because you're stubborn? You'll run out of free capital fast. Don't let your emotions change your trade plan. If your plan was ""I'm buying and its going to go up after earnings"" then you should add some more depth to your plan, imo. Now if you want to hold Moderna because its a good stock or it balances your portfolio out, great. Again I'm not saying hold Intel, or sell Moderna, but to just look at what you're doing and why. Stick to your trade plan/thesis.

>As for Tesla, the only indication that it would surge for a third day   
was that it surged for two straight. As I said, chalk that failed chase   
attempt to complete lack of experience.

If it was that easy, we'd both be sipping margaritas in margaritaville..or whatever it is rich people do, ha.  There are some things on a chart that are basic and mathematical that make a lot of sense. I'm personally not into some of the crazy astrology stuff like the triple flying rocket mutated doge seaweed pattern, but things like volume, moving averages, and basic support and resistance can go a long long ways. Hopefully the market calms down and your plays turn around. You're off to a great start, good luck!",,

620,gyo1l63,2021-05-19 06:35:16,t1_gyo1l63,t1_gymzh8m,stocks,"Be careful. That guy just told you to buy stocks that have been on a losing spree for a bit. This isn't the market cycle for frothy tech stocks. I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.

Apph isn't terrible and has promise. 

EV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. 

Other than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars. 

Right now, industrials are good, although with the inflation narrative, stocks with pricing power are in demand. Healthcare, tobacco, oil (eh, I'm bullish, but I'm biased), food and beverage (pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc) will probably do decent under this volatility, but won't make you heaps of money either. 

Banks are also decent buys, I like Citi and BAC. They will do well under inflation BUT have already went on a bit of a tear so dca into a position may be smart.",,

If something like that were to happen with steel I imagine it wouldn't be good. Although I find this unlikely, it's a possibility. 

Airplanes believe it or not I would short or sell, I would only hold southwest airlines, as only domestic flights in US are actually going to resume at a decent rate. With inflation happening as well, I'm not sure what I would do with airlines. People have wild expectations for these stocks but don't realize how indebted these companies are, american airlines is mired in debt, and has a pretty bad balance sheet to support their ridiculous rally. 

Restaurants and retail are dependant on an individual company basis as well. Certain companies have pricing power during inflation, some don't. Evaluate that, as it's only going to get more wobbly. But you're in the right place with industrials right now, I think it's rocky but my main conviction plays right now are oil, (similar concept to your steel) and financials with a touch of healthcare as a hedge for inflation.

I mainly buy shares and hold to invest, but oil I'm taking a swing approach and planning to sell most of my position when I reach my goal, and then hold the rest for long, that may be a good idea with your steel as well, as they are both ""commodities"" that are undergoing a massive cycle. 

I'm also buying call options a bit and selling puts on certain industrials like GE, because once travel resumes to 2019 levels, people will begin to realize how much more efficient that business is and the stock will appreciate greatly.",,

That's not an axiom, but just a rule of thumb since *most people* can't and don't even try to time the market.

In a sense, DCA is really similar to a wide diversification - you have no idea when and where the market will go, so you just constantly buy no matter what is happening.    
Diversification - spreading out your investments across the whole market, since you have no clue which companies will go up and which will go down.    
DCA - spreading out your investments across the whole timeline, since you have no clue when the market will go up and when it will go down.

If you sold at a loss then you triggered a wash sale on 40 shares of the other lot because you may be inside the 31 day window. If you thought you were selling 40 shares at a profit it is possible you sold the wrong shares. For example the system sold 40 shares First In First out and sold 40 out of the first 50 shares at a loss thus triggering a wash sale on ten shares and 30 shares of another lot. When you have to separate lots with purchase dates that close together inside 30 day window you need to be careful to not sell at a loss. Obviously if you sold at a higher price of both lots you would not have noticed an issue so I am assuming the sell price is between the price of both those lots or lower.,,
