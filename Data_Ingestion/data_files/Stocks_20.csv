If you've been interested in the stock market from october 2020, seen the incredible climb of those stocks till january/feb then realise that with covid opening up inflation is going to spike as the globe realises manufacturing and production isn't what it was, then you need to assess how and when you take profits and come up with strict guidelines.

Especially when you hear about the big boys like buffet, burry and dalio collecting cash since september 2020. Some of these guys did pre-empt it, Buffet missed a massive bull run on some positions. But he wasn't wrong. 2021 could have a big crash or several corrections or months of nothing, 1 week up 1 week down. Either way, you should have looked to take some profits off of growth stocks around January where all the graphs were at all time highs.",,

(2) Technology and automation put downward pressure on inflation.

Honestly, AAPL is a pretty safe company to invest in because of their increased dividends, massive profits, and growing subscription services which might warrant their higher P/E. I think AAPL is doing the right fundamental changes to their business like the Apple M1 chip to their Mac products, weareables, and growing streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV. Sure, they might not be as popular as their competitors but Apple is certainly diversifying their influence across their user base to provide more consistent revenue in the future.

I think AAPL is also objectively a long term hold due to their massive influence in most ETFs like the SPY, DIA, and QQQ. Their massive market cap makes it difficult to swing up or down too quickly and should be a stable long-term hold for investors. The fact that AAPL hasn‚Äôt done much since August 2020 is actually bullish given the stock could be ready for a massive move upwards since investors could look for opportunities for more upside from Apple in terms of technicals and fundamentals. I believe AAPL‚Äôs financials look extremely strong and any more weakness in the stock price will actually lower their P/E ratio substantially to look like a value play for a growth stock.",,

If you are going to do this, you must align your investment period with how the managers invest. You also have to understand if the manager has different types of investment products that invest differently. For example, in biotech, Orbimed Advisors is one of the best in venture biotech. But positions can be in the hedge fund (shorter holding period) or the venture funds (longer holding period). For large, diversified asset managers like Fidelity and TRowe, the 13Fs are useless because they have index funds. You cannot take any real investment opinion away from quarter to quarter changes in holdings. 

It is also important to not just buy the largest holdings. With good managers, the largest holdings have grown into the largest positions through appreciation. You will want to track the new positions and see if the manager is adding to them over time. 

For what this forum is looking for, you want managers with one or two products that invest for the long-term like us. I like the following:

I don't see how the M1 chip is going to be a game changer when computers are already much more powerful than people need. The processor is almost never the bottleneck anymore, it is usually the hard drive for most tasks or the graphics card for gaming.

Apple TV by most accounts is lame except for Ted Lasso. Apple Music isn't as good as other options. 

But I've owned Apple since 2003. I have, unfortunately, sold half my shares several times and have made lots of money from it. There is no question it has been an amazing stock but it's continued dominance are far from certain as its current products are in commodity areas now.

So, there's my thoughts.",,

275,gz7ymwp,2021-05-24 00:25:16,t1_gz7ymwp,t1_gz5sdkw,stocks,"Volatility drag is way less scary when you look at it mathematically.  For leverage ratio L, the expected CAGR is Lx - (L^2-1)/2 * stddev^2 where x is the CAGR of the underlying and stddev is essentially the volatility.  So for TQQQ, your expected returns are essentially 3x the returns of QQQ, minus (3^2-1)/2*stddev^2 = 3*QQQ - 4*stddev^2.  The stddev of QQQ over its lifetime is 15.43% and its CAGR is 20.51%, so this formula says TQQQ should return 3*.2051 - 4*.1543^2 = 52.0%.  The actual return of TQQQ is 50.86%, so you can see this formula gets you pretty close[*].  The additional difference is due to the expense ratio and cost of the derivatives they use to implement the fund.

TWO BIG RISKS HERE.

1. In a period of low returns volatility drag does become significant.  Volatility drag scales proportionally to L^2 and volatility^2.  It's been 9.5% per year for TQQQ.  That's been no big deal the past decade, but only because QQQ has returned 20.5%.  Notice that the volatility drag formula does not depend at all on the return.  So if we have a decade where QQQ only returns 5% per year, with the same volatility we've had, TQQQ will only return 5.5% before fees and borrowing costs - so it'll likely do worse than the underlying.
2. A true bear market like 2000 or 2008 (before 3x funds existed) is the biggest risk in my opinion.  This can cause a huge drawdown that takes a decade or more to recover from because you start with such a low baseline.  If you are young, that's fine, in fact it's desirable because you can keep buying at the bottom.  But you'd want to start ramping down your leverage decades in advance of retirement or big purchases like a home downpayment.

Because of these two risks I strongly recommend only holding a fraction of your portfolio in 3x ETF(s).  You can still achieve handsome returns much more safely at something like 1.5x or 2x overall leverage.

[*] Technically this calculation isn't quite correct, since I've used annual CAGR and monthly stddev, I should actually use daily CAGR and daily stddev, then extrapolate to annual return, but this is a close enough approximation.",,

>...completely ignoring that even Tesla admits their system is still level 2, and is explicitly not autonomous.

This is often misunderstood. If you dig into it more clearly, they were simply clarifying to regulators that, ""What we call 'Full Self Driving Beta' should be considered as level 2 for liability purposes"". The implied meaning being that, a level 3 or higher system will not be called ""Full Self Driving Beta"". Being the a beta release of the autonomous system, *it should definitely not be considered autonomous for regulatory reasons*. Level 3 is considered autonomous. Once it is out of beta then I would expect it to be level 3 at least, since level 3 is when it starts being considered autonomous.

The autonomy levels are really mostly for liability to determine when it starts to shift from the driver to the manufacturer, so it's very important to clarify exactly when it should be considered as level 3 or higher as that will result in an additional shift of the liability of accidents from the driver to Tesla. This can be looked at as ""Well, it's clearly flawed because they are avoiding getting it classified as level 3"" or ""They simply don't want to deal with the additional liabilities of level 3"", but realistically speaking there are really only two levels of autonomy. Either you need to be prepared to take over (level 4 or less) or you don't. With that in mind, it is best from a lawsuit/liability adverse perspective, to leave it as level 2 (car owner is responsible for accidents) until it's ready to be considered level 5 (manufacturer is responsible for accidents, but is much better than a human, so accidents are far less likely). 

If you look at FSD beta from a technical perspective and review what is considered level 3, then it seems quite clear that FSD Beta is far more accurately classified as level 3 than level 2 in terms of capabilities (stopping at stoplights, making turns, being able to complete drives with little if any interventions), indeed, out of beta it might be closer to level 4 than 3. So why classify it as level 2? Liability as mentioned above, it's wise from a liability avoidance perspective to keep it classified as only level 2 for as long as the regulators will allow or until it's level 5.

I will agree that it's less clear how long it'll take for it to be out of beta, and it has taken a fair while longer than expected to get here. Elon is optimistic that it'll be months (before 2022), but Elon time and all so perhaps more like mid/late 2023. If it's going to be out of beta and thus autonomous, then that would imply a public beta probably within a few months or so.",,

The US ""baby boomers"" are dying off, meaning there will be an upward pressure in commerce as the younger population has more money.

As the older generation (baby boomers) continue to die off, there will more flowing money in the economy since not as many elderly are sucking money out of healthcare, social security, retirement, etc - allowing more money to be allocated elsewhere.

I strongly believe it's the later, and I also believe it will probably bite them at some point in the future, quite possibly the California DMV investigation going on. That's going to end not great either way. It's going to either be considered that it should be level 3 and get slapped for specifying level 3, or it's going to be level 2 and get slapped for implying it was higher in advertising.

As for those 3 last words, they were not intended as there is no evidence that I could find that clearly shows that there was actually regulatory pushback against it being considered level 2. The DMV asked Tesla what they wanted it considered as, Tesla said level 2, and now the DMV has some raised eyebrows raised because the naming suggests it should be higher than that. My inclination is they were hedging and referring to it as a level lower than it actually is because beta is intended to be more of a level 2.5, though as I mentioned above, having done that will probably get them into trouble as well. Sigh, the USS TSLA sails some rather choppy seas, thankfully my trading strategy for TSLA makes more money the more volatile it is. So I'll be quite happy as long as it isn't below around 300-400 this time next year.

So far the overall performance is okay (+20%) - given I also bought before Corona.
Since 2 month or so everything started to go up and down, dividend season is almost over. 

In addition I pay for my house as a second pillar.
I don't aim to become rich or retire at 40. I would like to have a sensible investment strategy, I have no target timewise, no goal, no pressure.

My question now is if I should sell all and wait for a good opportunity to buy again? Trading fees will likely cost ~2% of the portfolio - should I stay invested and wait, maybe keep extra money for now? 
All companies I am invested in seem to be doing okayish business-wise. XOM is still down 10% , some other 30% - but during Corona even the most solid companies droped 40% easy.

So do I hold or should I do something?

I'll speak for myself... I've got pretty much all of my money on the table in safe-ish stuff.  Cause timing the market for me is hard.",,

Ok...so which competencies does that random mod have? What degrees does he hold, and where are they from? Is he a a 50 year investing veteran with experience in US and international/foreign markets? Does he hold a masters in economics? A practicing partner at a financial law firm? A multi million dollar hedge fund manager? [Or is he another 25 year old kid who happened to end up sucked into the GME fiasco?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVY2Kco8ng) Based on his age I'm guessing hes not a senior partner, isn't a long term investor, and he probably doesn't hold a PHD in economics tho that one is possible, if so good for him.

The companies current strategy (which most people don't realize) is they are using all these small one off trials to dial in their ideal patient population so that they can load up their next big trial with that particular patient and increase odds of success.

 We have 2 trials showing success with moderate SNHL currently. The multi dose and age related trials show us those are no good. I suspect the severe hearing loss trial that is currently ongoing won't yield that great of results because when a patient has reached the severe stage of SNHL, they most likely have had enough trauma to the ear that the progenitor cells aren't in that great of shape either so that drug can't really work very well for them to benefit.

When you sell an option, you receive money and acquire an obligation (to buy or sell a particular security within a particular time period).

Here, if OP were to SELL a PUT option, he would get paid money (known as a premium).  In return, he would be obligated to buy whatever particular stock at a particular price within a particular time period.  

Let me give you an example.  I recently sold contracts in $STEM.  The ticker looks like this: -6 STEM 09/17/2021 30.00 P.  

This simply means that I received a premium.  In return, I took on the obligation to buy 600 shares of STEM at $30/share on or before Sept 17.

I have $18k frozen in my account as a result of this (hence, these are ‚Äúcash-secured puts‚Äù).  If I didn‚Äôt have cash on hand, these would be ‚Äúnaked puts,‚Äù which I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.

For example, you hold 100 shares of AAPL with an average cost of $125 right now. Having 100 shares allows you to write these contracts or obligations that you will sell your 100 shares at a higher price and be paid a premium to do so. Let‚Äôs say, selling to open a call contract for Apple: AAPL $140 C 6/18 for $0.23. You‚Äôll be instantly credited $23 to your brokerage account.

Running a covered calls strategy is good for stocks that grow in price slowly and stocks that you don‚Äôt mind holding forever. AAPL is a great example since it is a dividend, growth stock with strong fundamentals. Ideally (and best case scenario), you don‚Äôt want to get your shares called away because you‚Äôd rather hold it for the long term and let those call contracts you sold to expire worthless and keep the contract premium.

Worst case scenario, you get assigned your bearish covered call play by being forced to sell your AAPL shares at $140 if the contract expires ITM or gets exercised early. Since you owned your 100 shares at a cost basis of $125 and got forced to sell the shares to the counter party at $140 (the agreed upon strike price of the contract you wrote), you essentially pocketed $1523 of profit. Basically, in a covered call strategy you are capping/limiting your earning upside in the underlying by selling a call option. If you think the stock ran up too much and implied volatility of the stock is high, you can sell a call option with a juicy premium to sell the AAPL shares at the price you want and get paid a premium in the process. Covered calls are good if you do it with a good stock that won‚Äôt swing too wildly, meme stocks for instance can quickly wreck your overall portfolio that is exposed to the underlying performance of the stock price. Also, covered calls will start losing you money in potential upside if the stock price moves above your break even price for the call contract ($140.23 in this example). So once AAPL hits above $140.23, that‚Äôs when you start missing out on further gains.

So, usually covered calls can be a great way to make some solid income on top of your favorite stocks and ETFs. I didn‚Äôt talk too much about the Greeks, this is useful to know if you plan to do a PMCC with a long ITM leap to sell covered calls against it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a beginner since PMCCs will swing harder if the stock trades sideways or downwards and it is also subject to theta decay (contracts lose time value and will eventually expire worthless).",,

A real accountant, or a WSB accountant? Either way I'm not sure that qualifies him as a peer to those people you described, but maybe it does I suppose

>It's not necessarily focused on GME, more so describing how the markets are flawed and/or set up in a way that harms retail investors.

Again, this is not new, ground breaking or even notable. Everyone knows the market favors the rich, the insiders, the hedge funds, the money makers, and on and on. Why do you think so many people ask things like ""Everyone in my life tells me the stock market is for the rich, not guys like me is this true?"" People have known for decades the bullshit that goes on in the markets. Accept it and trade and invest around it, or don't. People have made lots of money despite this house of cards burning for decades. Perhaps people could try the Japanese markets instead.

>I'd rather have some faith this could work, and end up wrong, than be as bitter and demeaning as you are.

Faith that...what could work? I guess I'm confused. What is going to ""work""? You'd rather believe that the whole market will collapse because GME isn't mooning? That the DCT is what...corrupt and everything is burning? If you believed this and that person also believed that, and the people at superstonk believed that too, diamond fucking hands seems like the opposite message to convey. The market is collapsing...hold all your shares, that makes no sense. I don't think 3 people peer reviewing an accountants work from reddit is enough to convince me or the majority of others that the house of cards is collapsing.

Then again now that i think more deeply about it, with very few exceptions, as far as gaming media goes, even your mentioned ones, almost everyone hates them, sometimes with burning passion. 

Problem for gamers is that companies have ''monopolized'' whatever they are offering, where else will they go to get your fix of whatever they want ? There is just no content on those obscure places even if someone finds them. Grudgingly they will swallow their 4th add in 10 minutes and keep going there, they will get past controversies after controversies and still use them, situation which makes twitch, youtube and likes very rich.

Then again we never took a look how their business is doing, might be earning mad cash, but since its not mentioned its quite a red flag, even r/pennystocks whips out numbers in their pump and dump posts, as this post i just commented on speculative aspects of it.

&#x200B;

>A streamer can mess up and lose their fans at any time

Not just that, if someone becomes target of cancel culture, whole companies associated with them can become targets too. Small chance of it being relevant one day.

Edit: took a look at financials, by the metrics it should rather be considered a pennystock. Growth they have is very huge, then again i don't know the market, so idk if its the circumstances or the company being amazing, can't make that judgement. They make that growth with debt and offerings dilluting the shares, and they are going to keep doing these 2 things, which makes its quite a gamble if investors by end of the day will be left with money, will beat the market etc.

They are also bringing stars like NFL star Richard Sherman and collaboration with Coldplay. Personally in pennystock world i consider it a big pump when I actively start recognizing the star names being bought. Which means properly timing this stock can become very essential to keeping the wallet intact. Stock price peaked up 500% past year(classic for stocks being mentioned at reddit), that is a lot of growth they still have to deliver on, anyone investing in it better believe the company for real, if the circumstances are not what investors predict, there is a possibility of heavy bags. Opposite is also the same, since its basically a pennystock area, it could go up few hundred % just as easely. A lot more to look into it, not just ''gaming so big'' to make that guess.",,

Intro:

> The global semiconductor chip shortage crisis has struck Volkswagen USA. The automaker has just confirmed that production at its massive Chattanooga, Tennessee factory will shut down for two weeks starting on June 7.

Excerpt:

> But VW isn't about to let a crisis go to waste. Instead of letting dust collect on the plant's machinery and many workers being sent home, upgrades will take place on the assembly line focusing on quality improvements and other related areas.

> In addition, workers will continue training and preparation to build the ID.4 all-electric crossover. At present, the ID.4 is only built alongside its ID.3 hatchback sibling at VW's Zwickau plant in Germany. That means all ID.4s on the road in America right now are imported, but this won't last for long.

And:

> VW is adding a state-of-the-art high-voltage laboratory designed specifically to develop and test EV cells and battery packs.",njom8r,"CarBuzz: Volkswagen Refuses To Let A Crisis Go To Waste (VOW, VWAGY)"

894,,2021-05-24 04:20:21,t3_njpdhh,,stocks,"Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, less than half a percent of AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njpdhh,Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

3. Disproportional effect from large moves: as an exponential percentage, large moves have greater effect.

They usually fly under the radar but can definitely make a difference for investor sentiment because a lot of people still hate GE for how it collapsed a couple years ago, it ruined retirement funds, pensions, you name it. People still probably have a bad tatse in their mouths that only good execution on their turnaround can heal. 

I've mainly played GE since may last year, I bought leaps and calls but no shares until a couple months ago, the market last year was easier to make money on options, so I figured the smart move once January hit would be to cash out and use some profits to buy shares. Im happy I own them, it's probably doomed to trade sideways for a while but once air travel resumes, their GECAS deal will prove to have been a great move.

I am also a little biased because GE was one of my biggest cash cows last year and thinking that the next couple years will be the same can be a bit shortsighted of me, but I am convicted and will stick to my bet right now as I see it as a safe, slow return on profits I have already secured.",,

This would make sense, as they've had to pile on huge amounts of debt to survive.

As a counterpoint to your post, I'd ask you to look at Terry Smith's discussion about investing in airline companies (namely: they're awful, and you never should). Airlines have consistently terrible low returns on capital employed and destroy shareholder value. 

I find his point so compelling that I'd consider any money manager who invests in airlines long-term to be either ignorant or incompetent.
