I'm not recommending you add more (I'm also not recommending you don't, I'm not a financial advisor), but if you do I would strongly consider purchasing some moderately-ITM leaps (middle of '22 or later) to DRASTICALLY reduce your cost basis (not overall cost), far more than buying more individual shares, and you're giving yourself plenty of time to be right about your thesis. And, if you are buying ITM, then you can sell some of the more reasonable CC's that are currently available to lower your cost basis further. If they get assigned, they get assigned, you turn a profit and then can potentially buy new call options based on where you think the price will go from there. 

In the meantime you can even potentially use the credit gained from the CCs to purchase more individual shares and keep lowering cost basis, if that's your thing (although with where you're at contracts are really how you'd lower the cost basis).",,

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

**Update (7:45pm) -**

**The apes won this battle but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME could have serious upside here.**

(I'm waiting on an explanation from Reddit why they banned my account just as GME's stock began to run but suffice it to say it's suspicious. FWIW I'm using the handle ""hedge\_hiker"" now.)

*As always, do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

1740,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

If we can find the repair crew/supplier for SpaceX, and invest in them, then we are basically ""betting"" on SpaceX doing well (more explosions and repairs in the future).",nl5ehp,Can't invest in SpaceX but you can invest in Concrete

1775,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Prior, I followed tons of these ""reliable"" people and trusted their advice... and every time I bought into the crap they put out my money went stagnant.. or loss. So... I shall do the same they are... BUY HOLD AMC GME and everything else that they've  suggested to sell now or dont buy.  So.. idk about anyone else, and yes, im a full blown mental defective, but until these horrible decisions lead to a huge loss such as  my current buy in has dropped to 1 cent a share (and I will most likely buy a fk ton more at that price) I will say F you intelligent stock picker folks and ride this bytch to the moon or Davey Jones locker.

They currently have several patents and are actively curing erectile and female sexual disfunction using the patient's own stem cells.

States are re-opening and relaxing mandates. Dining al fresco I say! Buy SPY $430 July calls I whisper softly. Memorial day is upon us, and families will be hitting the road. The summer travel season is upon us, which will cause oil to reach multi year highs. XLE perhaps? Surely those will print with energy sector portfolio weight at multi year lows.  My client hands me a greasy chicken nugget box, a few wrinkled bills wrapped around a single soggy nugget. He says ""GME, apes strong together!"". I chuckle as he walks away.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

2536,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?

In short, no.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

**Update (7:45pm) -**

**The apes won this battle but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME could have serious upside here.**

(I'm waiting on an explanation from Reddit why they banned my account just as GME's stock began to run but suffice it to say it's suspicious. FWIW I'm using the handle ""hedge\_hiker"" now.)

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

2579,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices. So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",nky421,Here‚Äôs some DD that WSB had been lacking

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in.",nkza6a,$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

With an ATM program, companies quietly sell stock into the open market at prevailing prices, and the amount of proceeds that are ultimately raised depend on what prices the shares are sold for. There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.

""This assumes an expected recovery in the patronage of movie theatres in the second half of this year.""

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

If we can find the repair crew/supplier for SpaceX, and invest in them, then we are basically ""betting"" on SpaceX doing well (more explosions and repairs in the future).",nl5ehp,Can't invest in SpaceX but you can invest in Concrete
2611,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
2612,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
2613,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

2614,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Everything for this company comes down to this one drug-Lupkynis (voclosporin).  But this one drug has the potential to being a wonder drug for people with Lupus and a big moneymaker in the coming years that should propel AUPH stock.

Some reasons why this drug will be big are the facts that it has shown high efficacy and a  high safety profile long term in various trials carried out.  It also has very little real competition as a prescribed medication.  Lupkynis is given in pill form which is easier for administration. The only other competitor of note for patients with Lupus is Benlysta, a drug which has poorer noted efficacy and a worse safety profile and is adminstered through IV or injection so physicians are likely going to prescribe Lupkynis first for their patients .

In regards to the moneymaking aspect ... cost per patient annually is high at $65,000 using Lupkynis.  It is believed that in a couple years  (after ramping up) it will generate sales of 1.5-2 billion dollars annually based on the number of people with Lupus in the US and other places in the world that would likely be prescribed this drug.

Aurinia has exclusive rights to this drug till 2037 so bigger Pharm. companiees will be sniffing around over the coming months.

As the OP said, the likelihood for buyout is very high here.  It could happen this year or next as the earnings rise with increasing patient usage.  

I've seen a range of values for future share price.  I'm not an analyst so if you have interest you should read what others are predicting.  It really depends on the buyout and when that happens, but some believe it could hit anywhere from $20-30 within a year.   Long term it could go much higher...",,

We are past the max price 52 target by the most bullish analyst of $16 and the institutional investors that are still in AMC might all dump tomorrow, which would be massive amount shares selling off tomorrow.

Will be interesting to see how it plays out this week.  If it really squeezes tomorrow or Thursday could spark a stampede for the exits and that‚Äôs where the puts pay off big.  We hit $20, just as likely there will be a pullback to $5-6 as there will be an increase to $30 in the span of a day.",,

In both careers and relationships, to stand in strength, navigate with poise, and evolve with purpose, it is important to humbly acknowledge and respect endings when they come. Adopting a different vantage point with clarity need not invalidate the importance of past versions and visions; recognizing incompatibilities between characters, will, and ambitions while learning from past faults need not nullify the positive imprint that people have left on our lives. Not all ill-fitting pieces are bad pieces and even bad pieces are not completely devoid of positive projections. Some have allowed us to feel out our own edges, smoothed and strengthened them in the process of collectively trying to make things work. Disappointment, surprise, and grief do not negate the finality, inevitability, and weight of the conclusion, even though it is human nature to delay the admission as such. Things will rarely, if ever, end as a well-deserved deep and hard slumber on a perfectly supple bed of fresh linen, on the backdrop of an amber-crimson sunset bleeding itself indistinguishably into the baby blue skyline. Although, looking back, the lines of where it all started may have become blurry, the line of where things end should not be an arbitrary one. It should be decisive and intentional.

in both caweews and wewationships, to stand in stwength, navigate with poise, and evowve with puwpose, it ish impowtant to humbwy acknowwedge and wespect endings when dey come. Adopting a diffewent vantage point with cwawity need not invawidate da impowtance of past vewsions and visions; wecognizing incompatibiwities between chawactews, wiww, and ambitions whiwe weawning fwom past fauwts need not nuwwify da positive impwint that peopwe have weft on ouw wives. Not aww iww-fitting pieces awe bad pieces and even bad pieces awe not compwetewy devoid of positive pwojections. Some have awwowed us to feew out ouw own edges, smoothed and stwengthened them in da pwocess of cowwectivewy twying to make things wowk. Disappointment, suwpwise, and gwief do not negate da finawity, inevitabiwity, and weight of da concwusion, even though it ish human natuwe to deway da admission as such.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

**Update (7:45pm) -**

**The apes won this battle but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME could have serious upside here.**

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Ford‚Äôs plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

3693,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

3694,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

This is labeled as technical analysis because what I'm about to tell you could shake the world. I singlehandedly caused this stock to explode, and now some of you may get filthy rich. 

Yesterday, I paper handed and threw all my single stock funds (GME, TSLA, AMD, and more) into an index fund (HLAL). 

For that reason, and that reason only, GME shot up about 25% today. 

I fear that if I ever buy GME again, then it shall crash. So I shall not. I have fallen to the underworld of boomer investing and am never to return to the feasts of Valhalla with my former bretheren.

We did talk to him, and to the team in general, about overzealousness in removing posts. To empathize with him, in late January / early February, it was chaotic to say the least, and we were all more heavy handed than usual.

We've done a pretty big 180 since then actually. I do my best to leave warnings instead of bans (even short bans) and zjz amended the bots to do same. We also implemented a ""DD revival"" process, where any DD that gets removed gets put into a queue for everyone to see (on discord)

Back to your point though, just looking at his past 84 thread removals (from Feb 26th onwards), 13 are GME, and 6 are AMC, which is a pretty low proportion IMO. The remainder were mostly SPACs. All of them (I only skimmed them) seem pretty reasonable removals, so my guess is we did talk to him and things calmed down -- but probably not as fast as would be optimal.",,

So he bought contracts (while GME was below 50/share) to buy GME at 50 a share. Each contract has an expiration date. So while GME rose above 50/share, he had contracts that gave him the right to buy at only 50/share. 

Thing is, options contracts trade 100 shares at a time. So even though he had the contracts to buy GME at 50/share, he didn‚Äôt have the money to buy 100 shares at 50 a share. 

So what you can do is sell those contracts to other people who have lots of money. If GME was at 100 dollars, then a call option at 50 would potentially make someone 10k off of 5k. 

Thing is, exercising is what it‚Äôs called when you actually buy the shares. So he put his money in options contracts, but he didn‚Äôt have 5k on hand to exercise the call options. So he sold some of his options contracts, made some money, and then exercised a couple of his calls himself and got the shares in his account.

My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn‚Äôt have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn‚Äôt beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn‚Äôt know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun‚Äô a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn‚Äôt doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I‚Äôve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.",,

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

GME has broken out of the channel but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME could have upside here.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

5655,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in.",nkza6a,$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.

- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

5687,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
5688,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
5689,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

5690,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.

Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

GME broke out of its channel but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME could have more upside here.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

So how are people going to try to cut cost of building homes? Are they going to look for traditional alternatives to cut down on cost like brick/stucco/hardie/vinyl instead of a wood based exterior, tile instead of wood floors, etc. ??? Or is there other materials that can be used? I know we will still be using wood for most construction. At this time, lumber it is still the most cost efficient but who is to say someone doesn't discover a more cost efficient way. Personally I see brick being used more in new construction on single family homes.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

5883,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

5915,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
5916,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
5917,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

5918,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

They were running really hot for a while but this drawdown has basically put them back on the trend line they were on before the latest runup. And if you look historically that's a really common pattern for them. They run hot for a while then revert back to the original trend. No idea why. 

But they're pretty strong, fundamentally.  They've got some of the best mines in the world and those mines produce more than just copper. They've got gold exposure as well as a few other valuable metals. 

The biggest concern at the moment is that the price of copper will fall and the market will overreact. FCX isn't going anywhere and there's no reason to think their growth will be capped any time soon.",,

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

GME broke out of its channel but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME could have more upside here.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

If we can find the repair crew/supplier for SpaceX, and invest in them, then we are basically ""betting"" on SpaceX doing well (more explosions and repairs in the future).",nl5ehp,Can't invest in SpaceX but you can invest in Concrete
6236,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
6237,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
6238,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

6239,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to look at the global population as an unmodified number of human beings walking around. There could be 1 billion humans on the moon but if they don‚Äôt buy much stuff from earth then they aren‚Äôt impacting the global economy. Right now there are billions of people in poverty who don‚Äôt really participate in the global economy.

Look at China. There‚Äôs a huge gap between rent prices in big cities versus the countryside. People in Shanghai participate in the global economy. They pay $700+ per month in rent. People in the Chinese countryside pay $10,000 to buy a house. You could probably rent one for $50 a month. There‚Äôs a massive gap in wages and cost of living. Every year tens of millions of people move from rural China to a city.

That‚Äôs what I think will happen in India and Africa over the rest of my lifetime.

AI will impact the economies of developed countries first but it won‚Äôt hit the developing world for a while. There are billions of people who don‚Äôt have cell phones yet.

They borrow asset from pools such as endowments and pension funds because they have connection with the fund manager and party together. After borrowing they start selling the asset to crash price. This creates panic in us and we sell our positions. They later buy it for cheap and return it to pool making the profit. To make even more profit they could do two more things 1. throttle the supply which crashes the price even more since people can sell more and buy less. So if you went to jewellery store to buy silver they will ask you to wait two months for your order to be fulfilled or in case of RH they banned buying security altogether. 2.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong their ceo is terrible at public relations but the company isn‚Äôt terrible. And for anyone reading the reason they HAD to take the buy button away is they would have literally been bankrupt. Why? Because when volatility skyrockets the clearing house makes robinhood front every single dollar of every single buy for TWO DAYS until funds are settled. Millions and millions of shares bought, every single penny of which Robinhood had to front themselves. Same with every other little app based trading platform. Nobody talks about webull or any of the hundreds of other ones that had to do the same. ThEy CaN lIqUiDaTe aT AnY TiMe yeah so can literally every broker. It‚Äôs part of the deal.

I like robinhood for long term stuff. Pretty much all they are good for. Almost 0 indicators for TA, trading on the website is too slow for day trading, so I just stick with it for long term for ease of use. I wish you good luck OP.

6777,,2021-05-25 10:07:40,t3_nkm5ho,,wallstreetbets,"> Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO said that it has extended its current manufacturing deal for another three years -- and that its manufacturing partner has agreed to double the factory's production capacity.  
>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

# SPY - Bullish Bias

# SPY [Gamma](https://spotgamma.com/)Read:

Gamma Index: Decreased to 0.06 (Large positive reading - play smaller moves in markets, likely that current prices are well supported by options market maker hedging.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Increased to 420 (May function as a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù and large liquidity area.)

Gamma Notional: Increased to 288 (A large positive gamma position infers lower volatility in the underlying.\_

Put Wall Support: Unchanged

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Increased to 1.09 (If the ratio increases it‚Äôs considered a bullish signal,)

Net Delta: Increased to 189.234 (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.07 (decreasing put demand)

TA Notes:

* 20 SMMA acting as a support

* Bulls need to break 421.04
* Bears need to hold resistance and test 417 support (have a lot of work to do)

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Ford‚Äôs plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
6840,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

6841,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

I've missed out on a bunch of other incredible plays too. I might need to switch brokers. I've heard they do track users. We might be cursed by PFOF.

>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

So how are people going to try to cut cost of building homes? Are they going to look for traditional alternatives to cut down on cost like brick/stucco/hardie/vinyl instead of a wood based exterior, tile instead of wood floors, etc. ??? Or is there other materials that can be used? I know we will still be using wood for most construction. At this time, lumber it is still the most cost efficient but who is to say someone doesn't discover a more cost efficient way. Personally I see brick being used more in new construction on single family homes.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

7584,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

7616,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
7617,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
7618,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

7619,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

There is an project called OnlyChads[OnlyChads](https://onlychads.fans) that I stumbled upon while on another sub.  It looks like they sell Chads.

Their goals seem to be very clear:

To immortalize all the Chads of our world.

Chad Manifesto:

OnlyChads was born out of an idea, or rather a vision; a vision to think different, to¬†Think Chad.¬†


At OnlyChads, our mission is to provide the net with the best Chad trading cards on the market.


As a brand, we have remained flexible, yet firm, in our virtues and ultimate journey to truly discover what is and what is not Chad. ¬†


OnlyChads serves collectors, investors, and individuals from all walks of life, but much more than that, OnlyChads serves the people.


Above all, OnlyChads strives to maintain its values of integrity and honor to innovate past the notion of what a true Chad is.¬† This drives us a to think past convention, and is what ultimately drives us to think different, to¬†Think Chad.",nl7ga4,CHAD money is Real MONEY

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

8294,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

8326,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
8327,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
8328,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

8329,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Need a new theoretical method to solve the equations exactly. So as far as reading materials go, this is rather advanced, and you wouldn't really get anywhere with lots of physics knowledge. The four core subjects in physics are Classical Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics/Thermal Physics, Quantum Mechanics, and Electrodynamics.  


The undergrad books for those would be along the lines of 1) Classical Mechanics by Taylor or Analytical Mechanics by Fowles, 2) Thermal Physics by Goodstein, 3) Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths, and 4) Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths.  


The graduate level for those four areas are 1) Classical mechanics by Goldstein, 2) Statistical Mechanics by Pathria, 3) Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar, Advanced Quantum Mechanics by Sakurai, and An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder, 4) Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson or Modern Electrodynamics by Zangwill.  


From there, you can start to understand most condensed matter books since condensed matter physics is an area of applied quantum mechanics.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Ford‚Äôs plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
8714,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

8715,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

However please note that this is 6 months of hard, dedicated work (let's say 3-5 hours a day). Even if your mind has an inclination to coding (i.e. you're analytical, like problem solving and puzzles, and/or love creating things), programming anything past the basics is still a bitch to learn and the #1 skill is learning how to be patient and persistent in the face of confusion and frustration

As to the question of which language... The important thing is not which language, but rather that you pick a language and get quite good with it, building up a portfolio of as many websites and apps as you can before you start applying full time to positions (or pursuing clients if freelance is more your jam)

Some general guidelines:
If you love graphic design, site layouts and organization, creating slick animations, etc, that's called ""front end"" and you should hands down learn html, css, and JavaScript because that's what will power all of that. Better yet, learn Typescript because typed languages have certain guardrails that will make your life easier down the road.

If you wanna program AI, the learn python. It's easy to pick up and there's TONS of resources to get up and running. However please note that learning data science with python is not the same as learning ""programming"" and unless you have complementing engineering skills (which you can totally develop in python as well) you may find it more difficult to find a 6 figure entry level job. IMO, data science skills + dev skills is a combo that will guarantee a $$$ career for many many years to come. It's the path I'm currently on.

If you wanna program on the blockchain and build the infrastructure for the future krypto economy (and as a wsb person I assume you have some interest in financial things), then I'd recommend learning Solidity. I don't have personal experience with it but I can tell you it's #1 on my to-do list. Being able to whip up smart contracts and decentralized apps is going to be a üî•üî•skillset and guess what? NOBODY has more than 3 years experience lol so imo it's one of the best things to start with.

If you want to create mobile apps for Android: learn Kotlin. Kotlin is like Java 2.0 and it's better in every way as far as I can tell.
If you want to create mobile apps for iOS : learn Swift

Although I haven't done this myself, I've heard from pople that if you're able to get an iOS app published on the App Store, then you're basically guaranteed a job at a big tech company like Microsoft or w.e. 

Bonus: Look I'm not gonna hate on Ruby on Rails lol a lot of companies are built on it. I just had a bad experience with Ruby... But who knows if you learn it the right way it's a great way of getting exposed to the ""full stack"" of a web application (i.e. the UI, the server/backend organization, and the database)

If you want to create games look into Unity. Game programming is another beast than what I do so you're best getting advice from others.",,

MNMD options for january have double the IV of SBSW options for january..... So what? And those contracts also have theta numbers, I'm sure it means something so I bought them.  


Also if you're reading this you should look at Biden's mining comments today and think that Sibanye is a prime candidate to benefit from that when Froneman was talking about buying a distressed battery metals miner with downstream US market exposure last year and has yet to announce their next acquisition. He's smart, probably waiting to pull the trigger until he saw how some of the cards fell, and some big fat cards hit the table today.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

9035,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

9036,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

9176,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

9710,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

9711,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.
