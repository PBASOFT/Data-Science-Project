# Big Hype, Small Cap

## Stage 1: Business Case Foundation

In recent years investing has grown popular among young people. They are known to be risk seeking and to gain and share knowledge and tips online.

It seems to be common knowledge that a stock can be hyped. Meaning that the price on a stock can go up solely (or mainly) because of hype. 

We have recently seen how these investors can cause a stock to go up against any logic, when a group of people on the social media platform Reddit decided to buy GameStop shares, for the sake of punishing hedge funds, causing the stock to skyrocket.

This is an extra ordinary example, but it makes us wonder if smaller scaled hype actually has an effect on stock prices. And if so; is that something we can predict?
