# Big Hype, Small Cap

## Stage 1: Business Case Foundation

In recent years investing has grown popular among young people. They are known to be risk seeking and to gain and share knowledge and tips online.

It seems to be common knowledge that a stock can be hyped. Meaning that the price on a stock can go up solely (or mainly) because of hype. 

We have recently seen how these investors can cause a stock to go up, against any logic, when a group of people on the social media platform Reddit decided to buy GameStop shares, for the sake of punishing hedge funds, causing the stock to skyrocket.

This is an extra ordinary example, but it makes us wonder if smaller scaled hype actually has an effect on stock prices. And if so; is that something we can predict?

### Focus of interest
We wan't to focus on scandinavian **small cap** stocks and **hype on social media**.

Small cap stocks are known to be volatile but also to have great growth potential. They are considered "High risk/High reward", which we think is a good match to the kind of investors we expect to meet on social media platforms. We stick to scandinavian small cap stocks both to narrow the field for this project, and because that we know first hand that the culture we're looking for exists here.

It is interesting to investigate the correlation between hype and stock prices, not only because it might reveal a whole new dimension to stock trading evolving around social media, and posibly the overall availability of knowledge sharing made possible by the www and maybe even more by social media entering the scene. But also because that revealing a correlation also opens up for the possibility of predicting stock priceses and with that: endless wealth!

### Hyphothesis
Small cap stock prices can be affected by hype on social media.

### Expected outcome of research
We expect to see some correlation between at least some stocks going up and how much they are mentioned in the groups, forums and-what-elses we investigate. 

### Who will be the user of the results
Knowledge is money. We our selves will be the users of the results and hopefully we'll discover something new and exiting. And we will then be on the path to becoming the richest persons on earth.
